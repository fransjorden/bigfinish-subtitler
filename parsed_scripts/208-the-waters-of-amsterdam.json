Tegan!\nNYSSA: Do you know that man?\nTEGAN: I’m very much afraid that I do.\nKYLE: (CLOSER) Tegan! Wait!\nDOCTOR: Who is he?\nTEGAN: Kyle.\nNYSSA: Kyle?\nTEGAN: (EMBARRASSED SIGH) My ex.\nTEGAN: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 3\nKYLE: (RETURNING) Here. Three coffees and one tea.\nTEGAN: Let’s get one thing straight, Kyle. If this is meant to be some sort of grand romantic gesture to win me back it’s not going to work.\nKYLE: I think I know you well enough, Tegan, to know that.\nTEGAN: Then what are you doing here? It can hardly be a coincidence.\nKYLE: It is. How could I have possibly known you’d be here?\nTEGAN: My mum might’ve said something, she’s always been soft on you. But it’s not up to me to explain it!\nNYSSA: Coincidences do happen, Tegan.\nTEGAN: What, out of all the places in all the world, he just happens to rock up in Amsterdam. Yeah, right!\nDOCTOR: (DRINKING TEA) It’s a small world.\nTEGAN: No, it’s not, it’s an enormous one, but with some people even being on the other side of it isn’t far enough!\nKYLE: If you must know, I came here to see the Master.\nDOCTOR: What! ?\nKYLE: The Dutch Master. Rembrandt. Look. (FX: RUSTLE OF TOURIST FLYER) There’s a new exhibition opened at the Rijksmuseum.\nKYLE: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 4\nTEGAN: I didn’t know you had a thing for Rembrandt.\nKYLE: Maybe there’s a lot you don’t know about me.\nTEGAN: I know enough.\nDOCTOR: Can I take a look at that? I’m a bit of an aficionado.\nKYLE: Sure.\nNYSSA: Doctor, perhaps we should...\nDOCTOR: Go for a stroll. Yes.\nTEGAN: Anything Kyle has to say he can say in front of you.\nDOCTOR: Yes, but... I’d rather not be present when he does.\nNYSSA: You two clearly have a lot to talk about.\nTEGAN: No we don’t.\nNYSSA: Don’t worry, we're not going to leave without you.\nTEGAN: You’d better not. Alright, off you go, if you must.\nDOCTOR: Yes, well, we’ll leave you to... it.\nTEGAN: Go on then. Explain.\nTEGAN: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 5\nKYLE: Alright, yes, when you did your disappearing act, I asked around to find out where you’d gone, and your mum -\nTEGAN: I knew it!\nKYLE: She was worried about you. I was worried about you.\nTEGAN: You don’t think me saying that I never wanted to see you again was clear enough?\nKYLE: You were angry.\nTEGAN: Too right I was angry. It’s been a month, Kyle, a month since we split up. No, let’s not mince words. A month since I dumped you.\nKYLE: I know, but -\nTEGAN: Since then, you’ve turned up at my flat, you’ve phoned me all hours of the night -\nKYLE: I want to talk to you, to make you understand -\nTEGAN: We have nothing left to talk about. It’s all been said.\nKYLE: Not by me. I want you to give me a chance to explain.\nTEGAN: I’m not interested. You’re not going to make me change my mind. (TRIES TO BE KIND) Look, we’re just not right for each other. It took me a while to see it, but as soon as I did, I thought it was only fair to tell you, straight away.\nKYLE: I know, and I appreciate that...\nTEGAN: How was I to know you’d planned to propose? I’m not psychic.\nKYLE: It was meant to be a surprise.\nKYLE: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 6\nTEGAN: Yes, well, well done, it worked.\nKYLE: I think you won in the ‘surprise’ stakes.\nTEGAN: You really didn’t see it coming?\nKYLE: Of course not. I wouldn’t have... if I’d suspected.\nTEGAN: We were never that serious, Kyle. That was the whole problem. You were coming on strong all the time.\nKYLE: I can’t help it, Tegan.\nTEGAN: Don’t say it.\nKYLE: I love you.\nTEGAN: Well, maybe you do. But I don’t love you, and I’m sorry if that makes me a bad person, but it’s over. And the sooner you accept that and move on, the better for both of us. (GETS UP TO GO) Goodbye, Kyle. Have a good life.\nTEGAN: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 7\nNYSSA: Tegan never mentioned a.. boyfriend.\nDOCTOR: Well, to be fair, she hasn’t really had much of a chance. And if he’s in the past tense, so to speak...\nNYSSA: Do you think he could be here by coincidence?\nDOCTOR: Possibly. After all, Omega bumped into Tegan - these things do happen. Maybe he really has just come to see this Rembrandt exhibition.\nDOCTOR: NYSSA3: Who is Rembrandt?\nDOCTOR: He was a painter. Dutch golden age, keen on dramatic lighting effects and grumpy self-portraits.\nNYSSA: Don’t tell me, you’ve met him.\nDOCTOR: No. Well, not yet. Living a non-linear life, one can never be entirely sure.\nNYSSA: If his work is worth travelling halfway around the world to see, he must have been a remarkable man.\nDOCTOR: (READING, DISTRACTED, INTRIGUED) Yes, he was. I say...\nDOCTOR: NYSSA3: What is it?\nDOCTOR: I recognise most of his work, but I never knew he liked to draw spaceships...\nNYSSA: What?\nNYSSA: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 8\nTEGAN: There you are!\nNYSSA: You’ve finished talking to... Kyle?\nTEGAN: Yeah. We didn’t have much to say.\nNYSSA: 3: No?\nTEGAN: He wanted me to give him one last chance. I didn’t. (NOTICES LEAFLET) What’s that?\nNYSSA: It’s about the exhibition, of Rembrandt’s drawings... of spaceships.\nTEGAN: (LAUGHS) You must’ve got him mixed up with Da Vinci.\nDOCTOR: Who?\nTEGAN: Da Vinci.\nDOCTOR: You mean Leonardo. Nobody ever called him Da Vinci.\nTEGAN: Doctor. In the last twenty-four hours, I’ve seen my cousin turned into a zombie, been held hostage by an alien with a henchman that looked suspiciously like a plucked chicken, been on a wild goose chase through Amsterdam, and had my ex- boyfriend turn up out of the blue. The last thing I need is you having a go at me for getting Da Vinci’s name wrong!\nDOCTOR: Leonardo’s.\nTEGAN: Leonardo’s!\nNYSSA: Maybe we could, er, go to this ‘Rijkmuseum’?\nNYSSA: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 9\nDOCTOR: Yes. Tegan’s right. Rembrandt didn’t draw spaceships. Something\nDOCTOR: very strange must be going on.\nDOCTOR: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 10\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR/TEGAN/NYSSA:\nTEGAN: What if it’s sold out?\nDOCTOR: We shall just have to charm our way in.\nTEGAN: (SHIVER) Ugh, great.\nNYSSA: Looks like we made it here just in time.\nTEGAN: You can say that again. It’s going to be raining cats and dogs in a minute.\nDOCTOR: This way, I think. (BEAT) Nyssa? Are you alright?\nNYSSA: Yes. I thought I saw something in the canal. Just out of the corner of my eye.\nTEGAN: What sort of something?\nNYSSA: I don’t know. Nothing. Come on. Let’s get inside.\nNYSSA: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 11\nDOCTOR: (ENJOYING THE SOUND OF HIS OWN VOICE) What is truly remarkable about this work is that while Rembrandt fulfils his brief to include the faces of all the members of the militia, he also creates a sense of drama, of movement. You could almost believe this was a real moment frozen in time.\nTEGAN: It’s a bit gloomy.\nDOCTOR: Gloomy? What you are seeing, Tegan, is the artist’s distinctive use of contrapuntal rhythms. You will also note the extensive use of chiaroscuro to bestow a sense of depth, both literally and, of course, psychologically.\nNYSSA: It’s very impressive. The faces seem almost alive.\nTEGAN: Doctor, what’s ‘chiaroscuro’?\nDOCTOR: What? Oh, bold contrasting areas of light and dark that suggest three-dimensionality. Leonardo’s innovation, developed by Caravaggio, perfected by Rembrandt. But it’s not what we’ve come to see.\nTEGAN: Speaking of things we didn’t come here to see. Over there, by the painting of the woman with the egg basket.\nNYSSA: Kyle! He followed us?\nDOCTOR: Let’s not jump to conclusions. He did say he was coming here.\nTEGAN: Nyssa. Do you fancy getting a coffee?\nNYSSA: Well, actually, I just had one -\nTEGAN: I mean, do you fancy keeping me company while I hide in the cafe downstairs?\nTEGAN: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 12\nNYSSA: Of course. Doctor? (HE’S NOT PAYING ATTENTION) Doctor?\nTEGAN: Oh leave him, he’s miles away.\nDOCTOR: Of course, what’s ingenious is Rembrandt’s use of colour - not only for emphasis, but also as a signifier; the red of the Captain’s sash against his black and white costume represents the city’s colours, while the blue and gold of the girl represents the company’s coat of arms.\nAMERICAN TOURIST: What about the fella with the drum?\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry?\nAMERICAN TOURIST: You are a tour guide, aren’t you? So. What about the fella with the drum?\nDOCTOR: Ah. Well. Yes. I’m very glad you asked me that, actually, because, of course, a drummer wouldn’t have been able to afford to have his portrait painted...\nDOCTOR: FADE OUT DURING THE ABOVE.\nDOCTOR: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 13\nTEGAN: (SIPS COFFEE) Lucky to get a table. I guess nobody’s keen on going outside and getting themselves soaked.\nNYSSA: So are you going to tell me?\nTEGAN: Tell you what?\nNYSSA: About Kyle. You don’t have to, of course.\nTEGAN: No, you might as well know. I met him about a year ago now. After you and the Doctor left me at Heathrow, I took up my job as a stewardess for Air Antipodes. It was on one of the flights I first met him.\nTEGAN: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 14\nTEGAN: (VOICE AND VIA TANNOY )\nTEGAN: Ladies and gentlemen. We will shortly be coming in to land at Sydney Airport. Please could all passengers extinguish any cigarettes, return your seats to a locked and upright position, and check your seat belts are fastened. Thank you.\nBUSINESSMAN: (MAKING HIS WAY ALONG AISLE) Excuse me.\nTEGAN: Sir, you will have to return to your seat.\nBUSINESSMAN: Out of my way, I have an urgent meeting, I have to be the first off!\nTEGAN: Sir, we’ll be on the ground in a few minutes.\nBUSINESSMAN: I said, young woman, out of my way!\nTEGAN: Please return to your seat, sir.\nBUSINESSMAN: You don’t tell me what to do -\nTEGAN: On this plane I do. So sit!\nKYLE: Hey, mate, maybe you should do as she says.\nBUSINESSMAN: This is none of your business, “mate”.\nKYLE: Sorry, just trying to help the lady -\nTEGAN: This “lady” doesn’t need your help.\nBUSINESSMAN: (PUSHING HER) Get... out...\nBUSINESSMAN: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 15\nTEGAN: Hey! Don’t push.\nKYLE: Leave her alone!\nBUSINESSMAN: I said this is none of your business. (SWINGS A PUNCH)\nKYLE: OF HORROR AND DELIGHT.\nBUSINESSMAN: Now, let me pass!\nTEGAN: Alright, you asked for it. (KICKS ON ‘IT’)\nBUSINESSMAN: Oy! My shin! I can’t believe it! There’s going to be a bruise!\nTEGAN: You should count yourself lucky I didn’t aim higher.\nBUSINESSMAN: This is assault. I warn you, I intend to contact the airline and lodge a formal complaint.\nTEGAN: Do whatever you like, just get back in your seat.\nBUSINESSMAN: (RETURNING TO HIS SEAT) You haven’t heard the last of this, you can be certain of that.\nBUSINESSMAN: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 16\nTEGAN: And that’s how I lost my job.\nNYSSA: It doesn’t sound very fair.\nTEGAN: I don’t think I was cut out for it. Being polite to complete idiots, not really my strong point.\nNYSSA: No.\nTEGAN: So I was given my marching orders, and who do I find waiting\nTEGAN: for me outside the office?\nTEGAN: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 17\nTEGAN: What are you doing here?\nKYLE: I’ve come to explain that it wasn’t your fault, what happened, that he punched me first.\nTEGAN: I thought I told you, I can fight my own battles. Anyway, you’re too late. I’ve been fired.\nKYLE: What? Then I should definitely go in, and -\nTEGAN: Don’t you dare. The guy’s agreed to drop his complaint if I go, while I get three months’ pay and a glowing reference.\nKYLE: So no regrets?\nTEGAN: I don’t know. I wish I’d poured a drink over his head while I had the chance.\nKYLE: (LAUGHS) Speaking of drinks, could I buy you one? If you don’t have any other plans?\nTEGAN: Not for the next three months, no.\nKYLE: Well, then. Give me a chance to apologise.\nTEGAN: You have nothing to apologise for. What you did, I suppose it was... quite sweet.\nKYLE: Alright. To celebrate, your change of career.\nTEGAN: That sounds more like it. What’s your name, by the way?\nTEGAN: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 18\nKYLE: Kyle.\nTEGAN: I’m Tegan. So, what do you do?\nKYLE: Oh, imports, exports, all very dull...\nKYLE: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 19\nTEGAN: So we went for a drink, we got on okay, but I thought that was\nTEGAN: that. And then —\nTEGAN: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 20\nKYLE: Tegan!\nTEGAN: Kyle, what are you doing here?\nKYLE: Just doing a bit of shopping on my lunch break. You?\nTEGAN: What else does one do in a shopping centre?\nKYLE: Ah. Yes. Good point.\nTEGAN: I mean, I don’t mean to be rude, but -\nKYLE: Tell you what, why don’t we grab a coffee. Unless you’re meeting someone or -\nTEGAN: No, I’m not meeting anyone. (SOFTENS) Oh, alright. One coffee. What’s the worst that could happen?\nKYLE: Do you fancy trying the new Italian place, they do cappuccinos, espressos -\nKYLE: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 21\nTEGAN: I didn’t really think anything of it, it was nice to see him, but then it started happening more and more. We just kept bumping into each other for some reason. Like it was fate.\nTEGAN: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 22\nKYLE: Tegan?!\nTEGAN: Kyle. What are you doing here?\nKYLE: (AT THE SAME TIME AS TEGAN) What are you doing here? (THEY BOTH\nLAUGH: )\nTEGAN: You first.\nKYLE: It’s a bit embarrassing, but I was supposed to be, ah, meeting someone. Only she hasn’t turned up.\nTEGAN: A girlfriend?\nKYLE: More of a first date. Or not, as it turns out.\nTEGAN: Join the club.\nKYLE: What?\nTEGAN: I’ve been stood up.\nKYLE: Oh. I’m sorry to hear that.\nTEGAN: You don’t sound very sorry.\nKYLE: Well, I just thought, I don’t fancy walking back to an empty flat with my tail between my legs, we do have a table booked, would you fancy maybe keeping me company?\nTEGAN: You mean, have dinner?\nKYLE: If you don’t mind?\nKYLE: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 23\nTEGAN: No. You see, I’m pleased that your date didn’t turn up too.\nKYLE: I never said I was pleased.\nTEGAN: Yeah, but you are, though, aren’t you?\nKYLE: A bit. Yes. We’ll just have to show them what they were\nKYLE: missing, won’t we?\nKYLE: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 24\nTEGAN: I mean, he was nice. Charming, in a way.\nNYSSA: I saw him, he’s very good-looking.\nTEGAN: If you like that sort of thing. Which, I admit, I do.\nTEGAN: I had a Paul Newman poster on my bedroom wall, alright!\nNYSSA: So you started seeing each other?\nTEGAN: Just as friends. You know, someone to go to the cinema with, someone to take to a party -\nTEGAN: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 25\nTEGAN: PARTY NOISE COMES AND GOES AS PEOPLE ENTER AND LEAVE TO FETCH DRINKS.\nTEGAN: I still don’t know what it is you do.\nKYLE: It’s really quite magnificently dull.\nTEGAN: Yes, but you must have a job title. How high up are you?\nKYLE: Fairly high-ish.\nTEGAN: Fairly high-ish?\nKYLE: It’s my own business. So I’m sort of the managing director.\nTEGAN: And what exactly do you import and export?\nKYLE: Luxury cars. Speedboats, yachts -\nTEGAN: Kyle. Are you loaded?\nKYLE: Well, it depends. You haven’t seen my flat, have you?\nTEGAN: No.\nKYLE: Beulah St Wharf. View of the bridge, the opera house. Open invitation, anytime you want.\nTEGAN: I might just take you up on that.\nKYLE: So what did you do, before you became a stewardess?\nTEGAN: Oh, nothing much.\nTEGAN: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 26\nKYLE: Nothing much?\nTEGAN: I travelled. With a couple of friends.\nKYLE: Did you go anywhere nice?\nTEGAN: (LAUGHS) Very, very rarely.\nKYLE: So who were they, these friends of yours?\nTEGAN: Oh, it doesn’t matter. I’m never going to see them again.\nKYLE: You might. I mean -\nTEGAN: No. It was like another life. Never to return. Can we talk about something else?\nKYLE: We could dance.\nTEGAN: I don’t dance. Well, I do a mean Charleston, but, no. There is one thing I’m good at, though.\nKYLE: What?\nTEGAN: This. (SHE KISSES HIM)\nTEGAN: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 27\nTEGAN: So we started dating. It was fun at first, I mean, he could afford all the finest restaurants, front row seats at the theatre.\nNYSSA: That’s not really a reason for seeing someone.\nTEGAN: I know... but it doesn’t hurt. And he was fun too. A laugh, you know. Didn’t take himself too seriously.\nNYSSA: So what went wrong?\nTEGAN: Hard to say. It’s not like someone flicked a switch. It sounds like a cliché... but I think the problem wasn’t with him, it was with me.\nTEGAN: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 28\nDOCTOR: So the trees in the distance are caught in the light, while the figures nearby are hidden in shadow and almost impressionistic, capturing not just the sunset, but the very atmosphere of the moment. And that, I would suggest, was Rembrandt’s genius.\nKYLE: (APPROACHING) You’re quite the expert, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Not really. It’s just a question of saying what you see. If you’re looking for Tegan, she’s not here.\nKYLE: I thought, if I came all this way, she might let me explain, but...\nDOCTOR: Yes. Tegan’s not the easiest person to explain to, in my experience.\nKYLE: We were happy for two months. And then it all started to go wrong.\nDOCTOR: I'd gathered.\nKYLE: No matter what I did, no matter how hard I tried to be the man she wanted, she just seemed to get more and more irritated.\nKYLE: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 29\nTEGAN: He just got more and more irritating.\nNYSSA: But why?\nTEGAN: Because... he was too nice. Too perfect.\nNYSSA: 3: That doesn’t make sense.\nTEGAN: I’m not claiming it does, it’s just that everything he did was whatever he thought I wanted. He never thought for himself. It drove me up the wall!\nTEGAN: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 30\nTEGAN: You’re going to have to take them back.\nKYLE: But you said you wanted to go to the concert, I checked.\nTEGAN: I know, you weren’t very subtle.\nKYLE: What’s the matter, don’t you like Elton John?\nTEGAN: It’s not that. I can’t have you spending money on me all the time. It.. puts me in your debt.\nKYLE: But I want to buy you things.\nTEGAN: But I don’t want you to! I don’t need you to. Look. I know I’m being unreasonable, but -\nKYLE: It’s alright. I don’t mind. I forgive you!\nTEGAN: (AAARGH!) That’s just it! You should be angry! You should be... putting your foot down. You never fight back!\nKYLE: But why would I want to do that?\nTEGAN: Because I’m not always right and I need someone to tell me when I’m wrong!\nKYLE: I’m sorry -\nTEGAN: And stop apologising! (BEAT, THEN TO HERSELF) Good grief.\nKYLE: I just thought, you know, the concert’s six months away, if I didn’t get them now, it would sell out.\nKYLE: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 31\nTEGAN: Yeah, but what makes you think we’1ll still be together?\nTEGAN: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 32\nKYLE: It seemed that nothing I did would please her.\nDOCTOR: I know the feeling. (READS SIGN) ‘Special collection’. Up here.\nKYLE: What do you mean?\nDOCTOR: Some people are only happy when they have something to complain about.\nKYLE: That doesn’t make sense.\nDOCTOR: Yes, well. You know Tegan better than me.\nKYLE: I thought I did. But it turns out I didn’t know her at all.\nKYLE: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 33\nTEGAN: I said, what makes you think we’ll still be together?\nKYLE: Well, this isn’t quite the moment I had in mind, I was going to ask you tonight at the restaurant, but.. well...\nTEGAN: Oh no, don’t you dare! Don’t you dare get down on one knee!\nKYLE: What?\nTEGAN: This isn’t what I want. If you knew me at all, Kyle, you’d know this was the complete opposite!\nKYLE: I’m not a mind-reader.\nTEGAN: No, you’re not. That’s abundantly clear. It’s a pity. Because... if you were, it would save me having to say what I’m about to say.\nTEGAN: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 34\nTEGAN: I know I handled it badly. But... all that time, I never really knew him.\nNYSSA: It sounds like he didn’t really know you.\nTEGAN: I could never be honest with him. I never told him about the TARDIS, and you and the Doctor.\nNYSSA: Would he have believed you?\nTEGAN: Probably. That’s the thing. He’d hang on my every word. Sometimes I’d even lie to him just to see if he’d notice. Nothing. (REACTS) Ugh!\nNYSSA: What is it?\nTEGAN: My feet, they’re wet.. the floor, it’s flooded!\nDINERS: NYSSA3: There must be a leak somewhere.\nTEGAN: You don’t say.\nNYSSA: It’s getting deeper. Where’s it all coming from?\nTEGAN: We can’t hang around here. Come on. Let’s find the Doctor.\nTEGAN: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 35\nDOCTOR: Ah. Here we are. “Special collection”.\nDOCTOR: I say this is most interesting. Are you actually interested in Rembrandt, at all?\nKYLE: A little. I’ve dealt in art, paintings in the past.\nDOCTOR: Did you know he drew spaceships?\nKYLE: No.\nDOCTOR: So it’s not general knowledge. (TO HIMSELF) A new development.\nKYLE: What?\nDOCTOR: Take a look at that sketch, dated 1658. Anything strike you as odd?\nKYLE: It’s not in his normal style. I mean, it’s highly detailed, but more like a.. schematic diagram.\nDOCTOR: Precisely. That’s what these are. You see that? That’s a gravity warp drive. And that? That’s a focus resonator.\nKYLE: I don’t understand.\nDOCTOR: Nor do I, not yet. But not only has Rembrandt been drawing blueprints of spaceships, but if somebody followed them, they would actually work!\nDOCTOR: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 36\nDOOR: CLOSES BEHIND THEM, MUFFLING STORM.\nNYSSA: What’s all this?\nTEGAN: “Modern art”.\nNYSSA: Sculptures?\nTEGAN: If you can call them that. Not really my sort of thing.\nNYSSA: No?\nTEGAN: I prefer it when you look at something, you can tell what it 16%\nNYSSA: Some of the sculptures are quite ingenious, though. This statue, for instance.\nTEGAN: What about it? It’s just a goblin or demon or something.\nNYSSA: But look at it. It appears to be made out of running water.\nTEGAN: It’s just glass. There’1ll be an explanation on the card.\nNYSSA: 3: What card?\nTEGAN: There’s always a white card, by the floor, saying what it’s called and who made it.\nNYSSA: Tegan. There isn’t a white card.\nTEGAN: What, but there must be -\nTEGAN: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 37\nTEGAN: Nyssa?\nNYSSA: It moved. It tried to reach out and grab me. (FX: IT MOVES AGAIN, MORE SPLOSHING) It’s alive!\nNIX: (GURGLING ALIEN VOICE, INDECIPHERABLE BABBLE - LIKE SOMEONE GARGLING, TALKING UNDERWATER. MENACING, BELLIGERENT — WOKEN UP IN A MEAN MOOD)\nTEGAN: I don’t know what it is, but it’s not one of the exhibits. Run!\nTEGAN: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 38\nKYLE: But how could Rembrandt know how a spaceship worked?\nDOCTOR: That’s just it. He couldn’t.\nTEGAN: (CALLS OUT) Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Tegan, Nyssa, what is it?\nNYSSA: We’re being followed.\nDOCTOR: Followed?\nTEGAN: By some sort of creature made out of water!\nKYLE: What did you say?\nTEGAN: Oh, you’re here.\nKYLE: I wasn’t following you if that’s what you - [were]\nNIX: NYSSA3: Down there!\nDOCTOR: Yes, I see it. Most extraordinary.\nKYLE: What in heaven’s name is that?\nDOCTOR: I have absolutely no idea, but it’s coming this way.\nDOCTOR: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 39\nKYLE: I have an idea. (FX: GRABS A FIRE EXTINGUISHER)\nTEGAN: A fire extinguisher? Great plan. It’s made of water, bozo.\nTEGAN: FREEZES.\nKYLE: There!\nTEGAN: You froze it! But how?\nDOCTOR: When pressurized C O 2 is released, the expansion results in rapid cooling due to the Joule-Thomson effect. So now it’s frozen solid.\nNYSSA: Not quite. It’s melting.\nDOCTOR: Then I suggest we take this opportunity to get out of here... Kyle, keep that extinguisher in case we meet any more of these creatures.\nDOCTOR: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 40\nTEGAN: (RECOILING FROM RAIN) It’s like a monsoon. We’1ll get soaked!\nDOCTOR: This rain isn’t a naturally occurring phenomenon.\nTEGAN: What do you mean?\nKYLE: Look. More of those creatures.\nNYSSA: They’re forming.. out of the rain.\nDOCTOR: Back to the TARDIS, I think. Nyssa, Tegan, do you know the way?\nNYSSA: I think so.\nDOCTOR: Good. We can split up. Kyle, you stick with me.\nTEGAN: Alright. Good luck.\nDOCTOR: You too. Now, run!\nNYSSA: This way!\nDOCTOR: Right. Kyle. Follow me!\nDOCTOR: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 41\nTEGAN: Are you sure this is the right way? All these canals look the same to me!\nNYSSA: I’m trying to work out our optimum route... To get back to the TARDIS, we must cross that bridge.\nTEGAN: Are you sure?\nNYSSA: Yes, I think so. Why?\nTEGAN: Look at the river.\nNYSSA: More of those creatures. They’re trying to cut off our way back to the TARDIS!\nNYSSA: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 42\nDOCTOR: Come on! We have to keep moving!\nKYLE: (FX: STOPS FOR A BREATHER) It’s no use, those things are everywhere.\nDOCTOR: Every canal, every storm drain, every dripping gutter. You may be right. But we can’t give up!\nKYLE: We're just drawing them off, aren’t we? That’s the plan. So Tegan and Nyssa can get away.\nDOCTOR: Hopefully. Whatever they are, it seems to be us they’re after.\nKYLE: What makes you think that?\nDOCTOR: They’re not showing any interest in the local population, they’re not attacking them, they’re acting as if they’re not there. And I don’t think them turning up here and now is a coincidence. No. They’ve come here for a specific reason — and that reason is something to do with me.\nKYLE: Doctor! Watch out!\nDOCTOR: It’s no good. We’re surrounded. (TO NIX) We mean you no harm. What are you?\nNIX: (INCOHERENT BABBLE, THEN) We are the Nix.\nDOCTOR: (TO NIX) What do you want?\nNIX: To stop you.

We should go.\nDOCTOR: Yes.. (HEADING OFF) Pity. Just as it was getting chatty.\nDOCTOR: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 44\nTEGAN: It’s no good. We’ll never make it across the bridge.\nNYSSA: We might. Can you ride one of these vehicles?\nTEGAN: Of course. It’s as easy as riding a.. bike.\nNYSSA: Good. Because I won’t have much time to learn.\nTEGAN: Sorry. You’re stealing these bikes so we can make a speedy getaway?\nNYSSA: Do you have a problem with that?\nTEGAN: No, just checking you didn’t. Fortunately everybody seems to staying indoors. (FX: CLIMBS ONTO BIKE) Okay, you turn these pedals, and the faster you go, the easier it is to keep your balance.\nNYSSA: I understand the principle, it’s the practice I’m not sure about.\nTEGAN: Just try not to ride into a canal.\nNYSSA: (TENTATIVE CYCLING) I’11l do my best...\nNYSSA: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL)\nDOCTOR: Here we are!\nKYLE: You’re going to phone for the Police?\nDOCTOR: Not quite. Get in.\nKYLE: Shouldn’t we be trying to leave?\nDOCTOR: Take a look inside, it should all be fairly\nDOCTOR: Page 45\nDOCTOR: self-explanatory.\nDOCTOR: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL)\nKYLE: .how can all this, fit into a little box?\nDOCTOR: You’re not the first person to ask that question.\nKYLE: We're safe from those things in here?\nDOCTOR: Page 46\nDOCTOR: Safe is a relative term. We’re certainly safer in here than we were out there. (REACTS TO SCANNER) Ah, Tegan and Nyssa are on their way. Where did they get those bicycles?\nKYLE: The Nix are out there too. Look!\nDOCTOR: Come on, Tegan! Nyssa! Come on! (BEAT) I’d stand clear of the\nDOCTOR: doors if I were you, Kyle —\nDOCTOR: DOORS AND COME TO A HALT.\nTEGAN: Made it!\nNYSSA: (DISMOUNTING) Just about.\nKYLE: Tegan!\nTEGAN: (DISMOUNTING) Oh no.

Now that they’ve seen him with me they may consider him guilty by association.\nKYLE: What is all this?\nTEGAN: The TARDIS. It’s a spaceship.\nKYLE: What?!\nTEGAN: It travels through time and space.\nKYLE: Oh. But... how?\nTEGAN: On a wing and a prayer, usually.\nDOCTOR: Tegan. It may be a while before it’s safe for Kyle to leave. Why not take him to your room and continue your explanation there?\nKYLE: You mean there’s more to this place?\nTEGAN: (RELUCTANTLY) Through here.\nKYLE: This is.. incredible. You never mentioned any of this!\nTEGAN: (LEAVING) Well, in my defense, you never asked.\nTEGAN: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 48\nNYSSA: 3: What about those creatures?\nDOCTOR: “The Nix”. Hopefully they will give up and go home now that we've dematerialized.\nDOCTOR: NYSSA3: Go home?\nDOCTOR: (FX: BUTTONS PRESSED) There’s no sign of them on TARDIS sensors. They must’ve dispersed back into the canals.\nNYSSA: Doctor. How can water be... alive?\nDOCTOR: Not sure. Some people believe water can retain molecular memories... And you’ve heard of a stream of consciousness.\nNYSSA: (ADMONISHING) I was being serious.\nDOCTOR: In answer to your question, I don’t know but would very much like to find out.\nDOCTOR: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 49\nKYLE: This place is unbelievable.\nTEGAN: You get used to it.\nKYLE: And this is your room?\nTEGAN: Was. I shared it with Nyssa. Looks like she had a bit of a clear-out. I suppose I’ve been gone for quite a while.\nKYLE: So when you travelled with the Doctor and Nyssa, where did you go?\nTEGAN: All over. Alien planets. Spaceships. Ireland. England in the twenties. Even the Great Fire of London.\nKYLE: And you never thought to tell me?\nTEGAN: Everybody has their secrets. It was... a conversation I didn’t want to have.\nKYLE: But why, didn’t you trust me?\nTEGAN: It’s not that. It’s that.. I’m not the same person now that I was then.\nKYLE: No? Looks to me that this is who you really are.\nTEGAN: Maybe you’re right. Maybe I have been kidding myself.\nKYLE: I’m beginning to think I never knew you at all.\nTEGAN: That’s probably the truest thing you’ve ever said.\nTEGAN: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 50\nTEGAN: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 51\nNYSSA: What are you doing?\nDOCTOR: Refocusing the scanner on the TARDIS interior.\nNYSSA: You can look into the rooms?\nDOCTOR: (OFFENDED) Only in the direst of emergencies.\nDOCTOR: HE OPENS A DOOR TO PEER IN.\nKYLE: (ON SCANNER) How many rooms are in here?\nTEGAN: (ON SCANNER) Too many if you ask me. It goes on forever. Come on, time we got back to the control room, see if it’s safe for you to go -\nDOCTOR: Commencing biological scan.\nNYSSA: You think Kyle might be an alien?\nDOCTOR: I think it’s worth making sure... When you spoke to him, did anything strike you as unusual?\nNYSSA: No. He seemed... perfectly agreeable.\nDOCTOR: Almost too perfect. Have you ever heard of mirroring?\nNYSSA: The subconscious imitation of speech patterns and non-verbal Signals to build rapport.\nDOCTOR: Yes. But Kyle seemed to be making a concerted effort...\nDOCTOR: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 52\nNYSSA: Well? What does it say?\nDOCTOR: (LYING VERY CONVINCINGLY) Human. One hundred percent.\nNYSSA: That’s a relief. I doubt Tegan would be very pleased to find out that her former boyfriend was an alien.\nTEGAN: Doctor, is it safe for Kyle to leave yet?\nTEGAN: NYSSA3: You’re too late.\nKYLE: What do you mean?\nNYSSA: We’re no longer in your time zone.\nTEGAN: What? You could’ve told me! So where are we now?\nDOCTOR: With any luck, Amsterdam, 1658.\nDOCTOR: HORSE-DRAWN CARTS, CHURCH BELLS.\nKYLE: You mean, we’ve travelled into the past?\nTEGAN: Full marks, give the boy a badge.\nKYLE: I’m sorry, I’m new to this.\nDOCTOR: The Dutch Golden Age. At this point in time the Netherlands is the world’s biggest trading power, enjoying unprecedented prosperity.\nDOCTOR: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 53\nKYLE: You’ve come here to find out why Rembrandt was drawing spaceships?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Seemed the simplest thing, just to pop by and ask.\nKYLE: You talk like you do this sort of thing all the time!\nTEGAN: He does.\nDOCTOR: Just need to check for signs of alien technology, energy traces, anything out of the ordinary. (FX: SEES READOUT) Now that is odd.\nNYSSA: What is?\nDOCTOR: It’s all entirely normal.\nDOCTOR: Well, Kyle. How do you fancy experiencing history first-hand?\nDOCTOR: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 54\nCLOPPING: BY. DOCTOR CLOSES AND LOCKS UP TARDIS BEHIND THEM.\nKYLE: Tegan. Why is the TARDIS a “Police Box”?\nTEGAN: It’s a disguise. Don’t ask the Doctor to explain.\nKYLE: Why not?\nTEGAN: Because he will.\nDOCTOR: We’re too late for Descartes - but on the plus side we’re arrived during one of the rare intervals where they aren’t actually at war.\nGLAUBER: It’s young Isaac, bring him over here. Quick, you!\nWORKERS: What’s wrong with him/I think he’s dead/What’s happened (ETC)\nNYSSA: Someone’s been hurt.\nTEGAN: Or worse.\nDOCTOR: (APPROACHING THE WORKERS) Let me through. I’m a doctor.\nGLAUBER: You’re too late, sir, he’s dead.\nDOCTOR: I’ll be the judge of that. — No pulse. Fixed dilated pupils. Lungs... full of water. He’s drowned. Very recently, too.\nGLAUBER: I was only talking to him, half an hour since, as were unloading one of the fluyts just arrived from the East Indies.\nGLAUBER: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 55\nKYLE: He must’ve fallen into the canal.\nGLAUBER: But he could swim, strong as any man.\nTEGAN: Maybe if he hit his head...\nDOCTOR: No signs of injury. (TO GLAUBER) Tell me. Where precisely was this man when you found him?\nGLAUBER: One of the young dockhands found him, over by the New Church.\nDOCTOR: On dry land. And his body and clothes are dry. But he’s only been dead for twenty minutes.\nNYSSA: So what do you think happened to him?\nDOCTOR: I think he was killed by something that can force water into a man’s lungs before he can call for help.\nWORKERS: Ain’t natural/Evil spirits/Devil’s work/Keep away (AD-LIB)\nGLAUBER: I reckon you should leave him be, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Interesting. You don’t disbelieve me, do you? Any of you? No... You’ve seen this before, haven’t you?\nGLAUBER: Not in front of the men. It’s bad enough, with all the rumours.\nDOCTOR: Rumours? What rumours?\nGLAUBER: There’s a Tavern on the corner, The Three Bottles. I’1ll meet you there. (TO HIS MEN) Alright, carry him indoors and we’1l make him decent.. You, lad, go and summon the watch. The rest of you, get back to work!\nTEGAN: Those creatures we saw in 1983, they’re here as well?\nTEGAN: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 56\nDOCTOR: In the rivers and canals that interweave the city. Which means\nDOCTOR: nowhere in Amsterdam is safe.\nDOCTOR: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 57\nKYLE: (RETURNING WITH DRINKS) Here. It’s the nearest thing I could get to fruit juice, I’m afraid.\nTEGAN: Well at least there’s nothing floating in it.\nNYSSA: Doctor. If the Nix are in this time period, why are they still here in three centuries’ time?\nDOCTOR: I daresay the answer will present itself. Looks like we have company!\nKYLE: Can I get you anything, a drink?\nGLAUBER: A bowl of hot soup, if you’re buying.\nKYLE: Bowl of soup, right. (HEADS OFF)\nNYSSA: We’re very sorry about your... colleague.\nGLAUBER: He’s not the first we’ve lost. Three dockhands in the past month, all gone the same way.\nDOCTOR: Your men mentioned evil spirits. Tell me, have you ever heard of a race of creatures called the Nix?\nGLAUBER: I know the name. My grandmother used to tell me stories, they sang songs which lured maidens into the rivers to drown.\nDOCTOR: But the creatures your men are afraid of don’t sing songs, do they?\nDOCTOR: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 58\nGLAUBER: Not that I’ve heard.\nNYSSA: Have you seen them?\nGLAUBER: No-one has and lived. Isaac said he had, just this morning - and you saw what happened to him.\nTEGAN: We’ve seen them, the Nix.\nGLAUBER: Then you’re living on borrowed time.\nDOCTOR: So you have no idea why they’re here?\nGLAUBER: (SHRUGS) Folk come to Amsterdam from all around.\nTEGAN: Including outer space, apparently.\nNYSSA: Doctor. You said this country was the one of the most powerful nations in the world.\nDOCTOR: I take your point. Where else would you go if you wanted to be at the centre of things? Where history hangs in the balance...\nKYLE: (RETURNING) Doctor. Something happening’s at the bar.\nTEGAN: Sounds like they’re having trouble with their plumbing.\nNYSSA: The pipes?\nDOCTOR: Oh no.\nDOCTOR: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 59\nGLAUBER: One of the spirits. It’s here!\nGLAUBER: NYSSA3: It must be after us.\nDOCTOR: Everybody! Get out! Run for your lives! (TO TEGAN) That includes you, Nyssa, Tegan, Kyle.\nTEGAN: What?\nDOCTOR: I’m going to try to talk to it. And in the likely event that that doesn’t deter it, I’d like for you to be as far away as possible.\nTEGAN: We'll meet you at Rembrandt’s house, I think I know the way.\nDOCTOR: Yes, if you like. Now go!\nWATER: WHOOSHING ABOUT.\nKYLE: Doctor, I don’t have the fire extinguisher.\nDOCTOR: Quite right. It would be terribly anachronistic. (BEAT) I thought I told you to go.\nKYLE: I thought I’d stay and help.\nDOCTOR: Well, let’s just cross our fingers and hope it doesn’t intend to kill us!\nDOCTOR: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 60\nDOCTOR: AND TEGAN. THEY RUN TOWARDS US.\nTEGAN: It’s like being ambushed by a water cannon!\nTEGAN: NYSSA3: At least we’re safe out here.\nGLAUBER: That’s them, those two women there!\nGLAUBER: Seize them!\nTEGAN: (GRABBED) Hey, what’s going on?\nNYSSA: (GRABBED) Let us go!\nGLAUBER: Now why we would we do that, when you are clearly alien spies.\nGLAUBER: NYSSA3: You think we’re aliens?\nGLAUBER: You were asking questions about the spirits. No citizen of Amsterdam would dare.\nTEGAN: A trap, it was all a trap!\nTEGAN: NYSSA3: But what about the Doctor? He’s still in there with that creature.\nGLAUBER: The Doctor is beyond our help now. Arquebusiers. Conduct them to East India House!\nTEGAN: (STRUGGLING) We’re not aliens!\nTEGAN: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 61\nGLAUBER: Don’t lie. It’s obvious from your accents that you are English.\nNYSSA: (DRAGGED AWAY) You think we sound English?\nTEGAN: (DRAGGED AWAY) How dare you! I’m Australian!\nTEGAN: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 62\nFIRING: JETS OF WATER, KNOCKING OVER TABLES, CHAIRS, JUGS.\nDOCTOR: Listen to me. We mean you no harm.\nDOCTOR: And I wish the feeling was mutual.\nKYLE: It’s trying to kill us!\nDOCTOR: But why? I’d hate to die not knowing. (TO NIX) Why do you want to stop me?\nNIX: We do not wish to stop you.\nDOCTOR: Don’t you know who I am?\nNIX: You are not known to us.\nDOCTOR: Interesting. Then what are you doing on Earth?\nNIX: Investigation and elimination.\nDOCTOR: Of what? The human race?\nNIX: The human race are incidental.\nKYLE: But you’ve been killing people.\nNIX: Any attempt to impede our mission will result in collateral fatalities.\nDOCTOR: What are you ‘investigating’?\nDOCTOR: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 63\nNIX: You intend to impede our mission.\nDOCTOR: No! If anything, I’1ll help you, if it avoids unnecessary deaths.\nKYLE: Doctor, I have an idea.\nDOCTOR: Not now.\nKYLE: The soup cauldron by the fire, it’s boiling hot.\nDOCTOR: I said, not now. (TO NIX) Look. I’m a visitor, like you -\nKYLE: Get a taste of this!\nKYLE: No, you didn’t like that, did you? It’s giving up, retreating into the pipe. Thanks for keeping it busy, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: And when it recovers, it’s going to be convinced we’re a threat, and definitely try to kill us!\nKYLE: Oh. I hadn’t thought of that.\nKYLE: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 64\nKYLE: TEGAN/NYSSA:\nGLAUBER: Sit. And wait.\nTEGAN: What for? Christmas?\nGLAUBER: (ACKNOWLEDGING) Mayor Polsbroek.\nPOLSBROEK: Thank you, Captain Glauber. I’1ll take it from here. If you would care to wait outside?\nGLAUBER: Yes, sir.\nPOLSBROEK: Good evening, ladies.\nTEGAN: You’re the boss of this place, are you?\nPOLSBROEK: You could say that. In addition to my responsibilities as Mayor, I serve as President of the East India Company.\nTEGAN: Honoured, I’m sure.\nNYSSA: Mayor Polsbroek. You must listen to us. Your city is in grave danger.\nPOLSBROEK: It is?\nPOLSBROEK: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 65\nNYSSA: You may find it hard to believe, but there are... creatures in the rivers. Creatures made of water.\nPOLSBROEK: You are incorrect. I do not find it hard to believe.\nTEGAN: No?\nPOLSBROEK: I find it utterly impossible. Oh, I’ve heard the fairy tales, but there are no “creatures”.\nTEGAN: Then how do you account for the deaths?\nPOLSBROEK: Deaths?\nNYSSA: Of the dockhands.\nPOLSBROEK: There are always accidents. Careless individuals. I fail to see how it’s my responsibility.\nNYSSA: We’re telling the truth!\nPOLSBROEK: That remains to be seen. You do not dress like citizens of this city, nor do you speak like them.\nTEGAN: Look, we’re not spies, if that’s what you’re getting at.\nPOLSBROEK: No?\nTEGAN: We stick out a mile. Wouldn’t a couple of spies try to blend in?\nNYSSA: And who are we supposed to be spying for? I thought you were at peace?\nNYSSA: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 66\nPOLSBROEK: We are. But there is trouble brewing in Zealand and we may soon be obliged to defend the Danes. And, while the English are busily engaged in war with Spain, they remain our greatest rivals.. and we understand your ‘Lord Protector’ may not be long for this world.\nTEGAN: He’s not our Lord Protector. We’re not English.\nPOLSBROEK: Then where are you from?\nTEGAN: I’m from Australia.\nPOLSBROEK: “Australia”?\nTEGAN: (CORRECTING HERSELF) New Holland.\nPOLSBROEK: I have read Tasman’s reports of the place. A desolate, inhospitable island by all accounts.\nTEGAN: That’s about right.\nPOLSBROEK: So how do you come to be here?\nTEGAN: Does it matter? Look, if we were spies, wouldn’t we come up with a more likely story?\nPOLSBROEK: If you were spies, you would say anything to deflect suspicion, even pretending to be touched by madness. And you, girl. Where are you from?\nNYSSA: 3: You would never believe me.\nPOLSBROEK: Then you shall have to convince me, girl. Because I am determined to get to the truth - one way or another.\nPOLSBROEK: Captain Glauber?\nPOLSBROEK: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 67\nGLAUBER: Yes, sir?\nPOLSBROEK: Would you be so kind as to fetch the instruments of torture?\nPOLSBROEK: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL)\nPOLSBROEK: Page 68\nKYLE: (READING STREET SIGN) Jodenbreestraat, this is it.\nDOCTOR: Let’s hope there’s somebody at home. Hopefully Nyssa and Tegan\nDOCTOR: will have prepared the way.\nREMBRANDT: (OTHER SIDE OF DOOR)\nREMBRANDT: I’m coming, I’m coming, must I never get any peace!\nREMBRANDT: Yes?\nDOCTOR: Rembrandt Van Rijn?\nREMBRANDT: Yes, what, what?\nDOCTOR: Excellent. I wonder, have you met two of my friends,\nDOCTOR: women, called Tegan and Nyssa?\nREMBRANDT: What is this? A joke?\nDOCTOR: No joke, I can -\nREMBRANDT: two young\nREMBRANDT: You disturb me, in the middle of my work, to ask about lost\nREMBRANDT: women? No, I haven’t seen them, nor do I wish to!\nKYLE: Tegan and Nyssa, if they’re not here...\nDOCTOR: With any luck they’ve gone back to the\nDOCTOR: find them, once we’re done here.\nDOCTOR: TARDIS. We’1ll go and\nDOCTOR: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 69\nREMBRANDT: What is it, you damnable fellow! Can’t you see I’m busy!\nDOCTOR: Sorry to interrupt. Wondered if we might have a word.\nREMBRANDT: A word? I have a word for you, sir. And that word is good-day!\nDOCTOR: Wait! It’s vitally important we speak to you. Tonight.\nREMBRANDT: You can tell Boelissen and Witsen that they’1ll get no more out of me till the auction. They might as well try and squeeze blood out of a stone!\nDOCTOR: We’re not debt collectors.\nREMBRANDT: Then what are you? Bailiffs?\nDOCTOR: No, I can assure you, we’re not after money or property.\nREMBRANDT: Then why are you here? (PEERS AT DOCTOR) You’re too old for me to take on as an apprentice. Go and bother Van Der Helst, he’1ll tell you which end of the brush to point at the canvas.\nDOCTOR: No, we just want to -\nREMBRANDT: You want to commission me to paint your portrait? Hmmm. Let me see. Pleasant open face... eyebrows will be tricky, though.\nDOCTOR: No, much as I would love to have my portrait painted -\nREMBRANDT: What then? A biblical scene? A landscape? I should let you know, I draw the line at fancy-women and dogs. And if it’s a group portrait, I charge per face! No extra family members sneaking in at the back!\nDOCTOR: I just want to talk.\nDOCTOR: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 70\nREMBRANDT: To talk? The damnable fellow wants to talk! What about?\nDOCTOR: Your work.\nREMBRANDT: You disturb me in the middle of my work to talk to me... about my work?\nDOCTOR: I’m very sorry if it’s a bad time.\nREMBRANDT: It’s always a bad time. Good-day!\nKYLE: But we have travelled a long way, and it would be a great honour. We’re both huge admirers of your work.\nREMBRANDT: What is this? Some game?\nKYLE: Not at all. The way you use chiaroscuro to suggest three- dimensionality is quite extraordinary.\nDOCTOR: And the way you achieve unity of composition is quite simply breathtaking.\nREMBRANDT: You know, nobody ever mentions that, and I spend hours getting it right. You are clearly a connoisseur, Mv...\nDOCTOR: Doctor.\nREMBRANDT: Come in, then, if you’re coming. And your friend...\nKYLE: Kyle.\nREMBRANDT: Kyle. Your voice... I thought I recognised it. But your face is unfamiliar.\nKYLE: You must be thinking of someone else.\nKYLE: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 71\nREMBRANDT: Yes, I must... Well, don’t dawdle on the doorstep, come in and\nREMBRANDT: tell me how great I am!\nREMBRANDT: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 72\nTEGAN: You can’t torture us, we’re innocent civilians!\nPOLSBROEK: On the contrary, you are suspected agents of a foreign power. have every right to cross-examine you by any means necessary.\nNYSSA: But even if we tell you the truth, you won’t believe us.\nPOLSBROEK: So you haven’t been telling the truth so far? I thought as much. So where are you from?\nTEGAN: Nyssa, no -\nNYSSA: I am from a world called Traken and my friend is from Earth three centuries in your future.\nPOLSBROEK: (SIGH) Well, why didn’t you say so straight away? It would’ve saved a great deal of unnecessary unpleasantness!\nTEGAN: I’m sorry, what?\nPOLSBROEK: Your arrival was not unexpected. Please, come with me.\nTEGAN: Where to?\nPOLSBROEK: The Countess has a chamber on the top floor. She’s very eager to meet you.\nPOLSBROEK: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 73\nCREAKY: WOODEN-FLOORED ROOM; TIDYING MATERIALS, OPENING DRAWERS,\nLIGHTING: LAMPS, UNCORKING SOME WINE.\nREMBRANDT: Please, sit down, sit down. Forgive the clutter.\nDOCTOR: Quite a collection you’ve got here. Is that a Raphael?\nREMBRANDT: It is. Over the decades I have acquired works by every major artist, glass from Venice...\nKYLE: Are you having some sort of clear out?\nREMBRANDT: In a manner of speaking. Everything here is for auction. Most of my possessions have already been sold to pay my creditors.\nDOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear that.\nREMBRANDT: Yes, but sympathy does not put food on the table, it doesn’t buy me oils or canvas.\nDOCTOR: I didn’t mean -\nREMBRANDT: They even threaten to take this house, my pride and joy. So, I must make sacrifices.\nDOCTOR: Some of these paintings are your own work.\nREMBRANDT: Unwanted commissions. Ten years ago, I could charge five hundred guilders a painting. Now I’1l be lucky if any of these go for over twenty.\nKYLE: But why?\nKYLE: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 74\nREMBRANDT: I am out of fashion. The “new Flemish” style! Nowadays people just want hunting scenes, and still lifes of whatever they’re about to have for breakfast.\nDOCTOR: This may be an impertinent question, but how did you end up in this predicament?\nREMBRANDT: You ask me how? Like it was my choice, my decision?\nDOCTOR: No, not at all.\nREMBRANDT: Not as a result of my own greed, if that’s what you were thinking. I know the stories that have been going around. No. I have been brought down by thieves and liars. They commission me to paint their wives and mistresses, but when the time comes to pay, they say they can’t afford to, they say they’ve gone bankrupt!\nDOCTOR: Ah. I see.\nREMBRANDT: Is it my fault they’ve lost all their money on the stock market, investing in tulips! Tulips, would you believe! I have worked every day of my life to put bread on the table to feed my wife and son, why should I suffer for the foolishness of others? Tulips!\nKYLE: Where are they, your wife and son?\nREMBRANDT: My son is studying in Leiden. Saskia... is dead.\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry to hear that.\nREMBRANDT: And now I am left, scrabbling for pennies. If not for the Countess I would be begging on the street!\nDOCTOR: The Countess?\nDOCTOR: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 75\nFORCEFIELD: GENERATOR IN B/G, THROB OF POWER.\nPOLSBROEK: Countess, the two time-travellers.\nTELDAK: Bring them to me.\nTEGAN: (QUIET) I get the impression she’s not from round here either.\nNYSSA: (QUIET) What make you think that? The golden skin or the sapphire compound eyes?\nPOLSBROEK: This woman is called Tegan and is from the future. This woman is called Nyssa and is from a world called Traken.\nTELDAK: Fascinating. Thank you for bringing them to me, Mayor Polsbroek.\nPOLSBROEK: There is a third visitor, a man called the Doctor.\nTELDAK: And where is he?\nPOLSBROEK: His whereabouts are unknown, but the watch have been informed -\nTELDAK: I see. You may return to your duties.\nPOLSBROEK: As you wish, Countess.\nTELDAK: (TO NYSSA) Traken. I have not heard of it.\nNYSSA: There’s no reason why you should. It’s very distant from this world.\nNYSSA: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 76\nTELDAK: It is? But so is my home.\nTEGAN: And where’s that?\nTELDAK: Corus-Valletine. You will not have heard of it. Please tell me, how do you travel in time?\nTEGAN: Not until you tell us what you’re doing here.\nTELDAK: Your.. caution is justifiable. I am the Countess Mach-Teldak, first born of the imperial dynasty and rightful heir to the Voraxi throne.\nNYSSA: Then why are you here?\nTELDAK: My world was attacked by a species known as the Nix.\nNYSSA: The Nix?!\nTELDAK: They made it rain for a whole year. Our cities and towns were inundated. We had no choice but to flee.\nNYSSA: So you came here?\nTELDAK: The Nix pursued my flame-ship across the stars. My ship was damaged, and I was forced to teleport to the nearest planet before it disintegrated. I had hoped the Nix would think me dead and abandon their pursuit.\nTEGAN: Well that hasn’t worked. They’re here in this city.\nTELDAK: I am aware of that. They will stop at nothing until they have executed all of my kind.\nTEGAN: They want you dead?\nTEGAN: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 77\nTELDAK: And to get to me they will kill anyone that stands in their\nTELDAK: way.\nTELDAK: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 78\nRATTLING: WINDOWS, SHUTTERS CREAKING IN WIND.\nDOCTOR: She is the one who hired you to draw spaceships?\nREMBRANDT: “Vessels of the stars”. Not my usual line of work but she was willing to pay and I was unwilling to starve.\nDOCTOR: But you don’t know how they work?\nREMBRANDT: No, no, my job is simply to follow the instructions.\nDOCTOR: Instructions given to you by the Countess?\nREMBRANDT: By her representative. I have never actually met her, but I believe she... appreciates my talents.\nDOCTOR: She must do, to take the greatest painter of the age and employ him as a draughtsman.\nREMBRANDT: Greatest painter? You really think so?\nDOCTOR: Wait. Have any of these vessels of the stars actually been built?\nREMBRANDT: One is in the process of construction, down at the East India Wharf. It should be complete in the next few days.\nREMBRANDT: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 79\nNYSSA: And when it’s finished, you intend to leave?\nTELDAK: Some more components are required, focusing carbon lattices, but Polsbroek is working on that.\nTEGAN: So what’s in it for him?\nTELDAK: The same thing that is “in it” for the rest of humanity. While I remain here, this city, this world is not safe.\nNYSSA: Do the Nix know where you are?\nTELDAK: I have remained hidden, by means of a genetic shield... but your arrival will not have gone undetected.\nTEGAN: You can say that again, one of those things attacked us -\nTELDAK: And they will try to use you, to get at me.\nTEGAN: You mean, they’ll have followed us... (YELP) Ah.\nTEGAN: NYSSA3: What is it?\nTEGAN: Cold water, on the back of my neck.\nNYSSA: The wall drapes. They’re wet. Soaked!\nTEGAN: It must be seeping through from outside.\nTELDAK: The Nix are attempting to enter. I must summon the watch!\nTELDAK: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 80\nSPLOSH: AS IT APPROACHES.\nTEGAN: Too late.\nTEGAN: NYSSA3: There’s more of them -\nNIX: Where is the Countess?\nNYSSA: What?\nNIX: Where is the Countess Mach-Teldak? Where!\nTEGAN: (SOTTO) They can’t see her!\nNYSSA: (SOTTO) The ‘genetic shield’. They don’t know she’s here.\nNIX: If she is in this chamber, she will reveal herself. Or both of these women will die!\nTELDAK: Leave the women. I am the one you want.\nNIX: You are Mach-Teldak of Corus-Valletine?\nTELDAK: I am.\nNIX: You have been sentenced to execution.\nTELDAK: I am a highborn. We do not fear death.\nNIX: Good. Your elimination will be swift.\nNIX: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL)\nTEGAN: Can’t we help her?\nNYSSA: There’s nothing we can do.\nTEGAN: But.. she’s being drowned!\nTEGAN: END OF PART TWO\nTEGAN: Page 81\nTEGAN: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 82"

Kyle is an android.\nNYSSA: 3: Doctor!\nTEGAN: What d’you mean, he’s an android?\nKYLE: Tegan. I am an artificial construct.

The danger has passed.\nPOLSBROEK: (HE HELPS HER UP) Danger? Those two women, where are they?\nTELDAK: (BEING HELPED UP) They do not pose a threat. Quite the opposite.\nPOLSBROEK: I don’t understand.\nTELDAK: There is a reason why I sought the company of time-travellers. To make my escape.\nPOLSBROEK: Your escape? But I thought the vessel of the stars -\nTELDAK: Don’t worry. All your effort and expense will not have been wasted. Listen very carefully, and I will explain.\nTELDAK: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 88\nREMBRANDT: Oh, it’s you again.\nDOCTOR: Sorry, were you going to bed?\nREMBRANDT: No, I like to wander the house in my nightgown for fun. I see you’ve found your two lost women.\nTEGAN: Hi. I’m Tegan.\nNYSSA: Nyssa.\nREMBRANDT: Hello. I’m Rembrandt. You may have heard of me, I used to be a painter before I became a laughing stock to be knocked up at all hours for the amusement of passers-by.\nDOCTOR: We’ve come here because you’re the only man who can help us. We have nowhere else to go.\nREMBRANDT: Well, that’s hardly my problem, is it?\nKYLE: No, but you do have lots of empty rooms.\nREMBRANDT: I suppose these... women are also admirers of my work?\nNYSSA: Oh yes. Your use of chiaroscuro is most impressive.\nREMBRANDT: Quite. What about you, “Tegan”?\nTEGAN: .What she said. Chiaroscuro.\nTEGAN: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 89\nREMBRANDT: Quite. Alright, come one, come all. Make yourselves at home. Feel free to help yourself to a painting, always handy for covering up signs of rising damp...\nREMBRANDT: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 90\nREMBRANDT: I think I may have a few blankets left upstairs. If not, you’re welcome to use the sheets covering the furniture, such as it is:\nTEGAN: Well, he wasn’t very friendly, was he?\nNYSSA: He let us in.\nTEGAN: Yes, but he didn’t have to be so miserable about it.\nKYLE: He has money troubles. That’s why he agreed to work for the Countess.\nDOCTOR: Why you hired him on her behalf.\nKYLE: Yes, Doctor. What made you realise?\nDOCTOR: Rembrandt recognised your voice but not your face. Which is interesting, and I speak as someone who’s had more faces than most.\nKYLE: Yes, well, it’s a long story.\nTEGAN: Then start.\nKYLE: My name is Kylex-Twelve, servant of the Countess Mach-Teldak. When our planet was besieged by the Nix, I helped her to escape.\nNYSSA: And when her ship was damaged, you teleported to Earth?\nNYSSA: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 91\nKYLE: I did. I helped her establish herself in this civilisation and conceal herself from the Nix.\nTEGAN: Can we skip this and get to the bit where you ask me out under false pretences?\nKYLE: After the Countess was marooned on this planet, she set in motion the means of her departure. I hired Rembrandt to design a spaceship while she convinced the Mayor to finance its construction.\nNYSSA: But if she used it to escape, the Nix would attack it, it would never leave the atmosphere.\nKYLE: So the Countess had another plan. She instructed me to search the Earth for other extra-terrestrial visitors.\nTEGAN: So she could hitch a ride?\nKYLE: I left the Countess... a month ago, relatively speaking. And I walked the Earth for the next three centuries, looking for any visitors with the capacity for time-travel.\nNYSSA: And that’s what led you to Tegan.\nKYLE: I’d almost given up hope until I was on a flight to Sydney and detected a temporal energy signature.\nTEGAN: Me.\nDOCTOR: A side-effect of TARDIS-travel, you may have picked up a few harmless exotic particles along the way.\nTEGAN: Now you tell me!\nKYLE: So once I’d identified you as the... source, I conducted a basic scan of your mind, your physical and psycho-social preferences, to make myself amenable to you.\nKYLE: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 92\nTEGAN: You did what?\nKYLE: I conducted a basic scan -\nTEGAN: You looked inside my head? You poked around my memories just to find out what kinds of blokes I liked? Just so you could get a ride in the TARDIS?\nKYLE: I thought that if you had travelled in time before, it was probable that you would do so again.\nDOCTOR: And once Tegan led you to me, you mentioned Rembrandt’s drawings so I’d want to pop back in time to investigate. (REALISES) Of course! The Nix weren’t trying to stop me at all, were they? They were trying to stop you!\nNYSSA: So you were programmed to act like you were in love with Tegan, to gain her confidence?\nKYLE: No. I wasn’t acting.\nTEGAN: What?\nKYLE: From the very first moment I saw you, I knew that I loved you. Not because it was part of my mission, or I was programmed to. I fell in love. It wasn’t meant to happen.\nKYLE: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 93\nTELDAK: The craft at the East India Wharf will serve as a prototype.\nPOLSBROEK: But its mechanisms are a complete mystery to us.\nTELDAK: Your scholars will soon grasp the scientific principles. Your species is only a few centuries from making these discoveries for itself.\nPOLSBROEK: A few centuries! So.. you intend to leave us this knowledge as some sort of parting gift?\nTELDAK: Not quite. In my absence, you will construct more such vessels. A whole fleet.\nPOLSBROEK: But with such craft... no force could defy us. The East India Company would be the greatest power on Earth! But you won’t be around to witness any of this.\nTELDAK: The knowledge that you will continue my work will be enough. You - and your descendants. Do not forget me.\nPOLSBROEK: How could we, after you have given us so much?\nTELDAK: Enter.\nGLAUBER: Countess, Mayor. The Arquebusiers have found an... unusual object\nGLAUBER: in the corner of Dam Square.\nTELDAK: What manner of “unusual object”?\nGLAUBER: A wooden structure. It defies all attempts to open it.\nGLAUBER: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 94\nTELDAK: Have it brought here. I wish to examine it for myself.\nTELDAK: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 95\nNYSSA: Kyle’s trying to talk to Tegan. She doesn’t want to listen.\nDOCTOR: Yes. The situation is... complicated.\nNYSSA: Doctor. You told me Kyle was human.\nDOCTOR: Yes. A white lie.\nNYSSA: You couldn’t trust me to keep it secret?\nDOCTOR: I didn’t want to put you in the position of having to lie to your best friend.\nNYSSA: So you lied to me.\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry. The scan revealed Kyle’s brain was made of positronic circuitry.\nNYSSA: And the ‘mirroring’ you observed -\nDOCTOR: An android trying to pass as human. Overcompensating.\nNYSSA: Doctor. Can Kyle really be in love with her?\nDOCTOR: Because he’s an android, you mean?\nNYSSA: Well, yes.\nDOCTOR: He seems to be under the impression he can.\nDOCTOR: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 96\nNYSSA: But what if it was just part of his programming, what if he had no choice in the matter?\nDOCTOR: Do any of us have any choice who we fall in love with? — I suppose it could be, but what if it is?\nNYSSA: Then you can correct it. He can be re-programmed not to love her.\nDOCTOR: That’s not for me to decide.\nNYSSA: You mean you’re not going to do anything?\nDOCTOR: None of my business. I have other matters to attend to.\nNYSSA: Where are you going?\nDOCTOR: To see the Countess. I gather she’s expecting a lift.\nDOCTOR: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 97\nTEGAN: I told you, I don’t want to talk.\nKYLE: (MUFFLED) Then I’1l stay here all night. Just let me say my piece, then I’ll go.\nTEGAN: I’1ll hold you to that.\nKYLE: I owe you an apology.\nTEGAN: You don’t say.\nKYLE: I’m sorry I lied to you. I was scared, I suppose, that if I told you the truth, you’d want nothing more to do with me.\nTEGAN: Well, you got that much right.\nKYLE: But I wanted to tell you. Because I -\nTEGAN: Kyle, let me tell you something. You don’t love me, because if you did, you would’ve been honest with me. That’s what love is.\nKYLE: You didn’t tell me the truth.\nTEGAN: And that’s why I knew that I didn’t love you. Because I was pretending to be someone I’m not. You’re not in love if you’re play-acting. And you can’t expect someone to fall in love with you, if all you’re doing is spinning them a yarn.\nKYLE: Maybe we could make a fresh start?\nTEGAN: It’s too late. You’re a robot, for goodness’ sake.\nTEGAN: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 98\nKYLE: My positronic brain is seventy times more complex than the human brain. Any emotion you can feel, I can feel.\nTEGAN: When will you get it into your head, you don’t love me! You just think you do. It’s like... you’ve got your wires crossed.\nKYLE: I wish it was that simple.\nTEGAN: Can’t you just reprogramme yourself to forget about me?\nKYLE: No. I can’t.\nTEGAN: If you genuinely loved me, you would.\nKYLE: It’s because I love you that I can’t.\nTEGAN: Please. Anyone, if they had a switch in their head that could make them stop loving the wrong person, would flip that switch.\nKYLE: You think I’m just a machine? But it’s the fact that I’m capable of love that means I’m alive.\nTEGAN: It’s up to you. Either way, once this is over, I never want to see you again. You’re not to look for me, and if we’re ever in the same room, act like I’m not there.\nKYLE: If that’s what you want.\nTEGAN: Don’t put it on me. I’m not saying this because it’s what I want but because it’s what’s best - for both of us.\nKYLE: Yes. Agreed.\nTEGAN: Then I think we’re done.\nTEGAN: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 99\nKYLE: Yes. I just wanted to let you know, I’m sorry.\nKYLE: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 100\nGLAUBER: Working late, sir?\nPOLSBROEK: Evidently. What can I do for you, Captain?\nGLAUBER: There’s a gentleman at the gate, sir.\nPOLSBROEK: A gentleman?\nGLAUBER: The Doctor. Didn’t give a surname, although I enquired repeatedly.\nPOLSBROEK: Send him away, I’m busy...\nGLAUBER: I would have, sir, except that he claims he is a time- traveller, come to collect the Countess.\nPOLSBROEK: What? Then bring him here at once.\nGLAUBER: (LEAVING) Yes, sir. Right away!\nGLAUBER: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 101\nREMBRANDT: Sorry, I didn’t expect anyone to still be down here...\nNYSSA: No, it’s alright. I was just.. waiting for the dawn.\nREMBRANDT: Do you mind if I wait with you?\nNYSSA: You can’t sleep either?\nREMBRANDT: No. I haven’t been able to sleep for a long time.\nNYSSA: It must be very worrying, to be in financial difficulty.\nREMBRANDT: It is out of my hands. My humiliation awaits. Forty years, of toiling every hour God sent and I have nothing to show for it. My only hope is to save some money for my son, and enough for a small place in the West Quarter.\nNYSSA: What if I told you that in the future, your work will be highly valued, and highly regarded?\nREMBRANDT: Then I would ask you what use it was to me, to know that others will profit from my labour? What comfort is it for me to know that I will be highly regarded after my death?\nNYSSA: I just thought -\nREMBRANDT: I’d like my rewards now, not when I’m lying in my grave.\nNYSSA: What about your reputation?\nREMBRANDT: My good name has been ruined by that madwoman Geertje, who has stolen from me, and slandered me. I am beyond redemption.\nREMBRANDT: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 102\nNYSSA: And that’s why you sit alone in the dark?\nREMBRANDT: No, I sit alone in the dark because... in the darkness, I feel close to Saskia.\nNYSSA: Your wife?\nREMBRANDT: In the shadows and shapes that form in the flicker of the candlelight... it’s as if she’s still here beside me.\nNYSSA: You must miss her terribly.\nREMBRANDT: People say that, but that’s not how it feels. It feels like she’s always in the next room, just out of sight.\nNYSSA: The dead are always with us, in our memories and our dreams.\nREMBRANDT: That’s why I can’t sleep. Because in my dream I’1l forget she’s dead, then I’1ll wake up - (BREAKS DOWN) - and remember.\nNYSSA: It’s hard. I’ve lost people dear to me. More than you could ever know.\nREMBRANDT: She was my life. What am I supposed to do when my reason for living is gone? I go on, yes, I get up in the morning, I work, I eat, I drink, I go to bed. It never gets any easier.\nNYSSA: No, it doesn’t get any easier. You just grow accustomed to the pain.\nNYSSA: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 103\nPOLSBROEK: Countess, may I present... the Doctor.\nDOCTOR: (ENTERS) Good morning. I understand you’ve gone to a great deal of trouble to bring me here.\nTELDAK: Thank you, Polsbroek. That will be all.\nPOLSBROEK: Countess.\nTELDAK: Doctor. You find me alone, stranded and under threat of death.\nDOCTOR: Yes, my friend told me what happened. But you’ve arranged for a Spaceship to be built, and very impressive it is too. So why do you need me?\nTELDAK: Why a time-traveller, you mean?\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nTELDAK: Is it not obvious? The Nix invaded my home world. With a time- machine, that could be averted.\nDOCTOR: That’s quite a big thing to ask.\nTELDAK: Or at least more of my people could be saved.\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid I can’t.\nTELDAK: “Can't”? Because it is a physical impossibility - or because you do not wish to?\nTELDAK: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 104\nDOCTOR: The past has been written. Any attempt to change the course of established history will result in disaster... Believe me, it’s been tried.\nTELDAK: I understand. I am in no position to make demands. But you realise that while I remain on Earth, the Nix will continue to pose a threat to the indigenous life.\nDOCTOR: So either I help you or more innocent people will die.\nTELDAK: No. If you refuse, I will submit myself to the justice of the Nix and allow them to execute me.\nDOCTOR: So. If I agree... where do you want to go?\nTELDAK: All I desire is see my home one last time before I die. Is that too much to ask?\nTELDAK: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 105\nTELDAK: INCOHERENTLY, SINISTER SPLOSHING.\nREMBRANDT: It’s almost as if the rain is trying to get in.\nKYLE: (ENTERING) It is.\nREMBRANDT: What? I don’t understand.\nTEGAN: (ENTERING) The Nix. Are all the windows closed? All the shutters?\nREMBRANDT: Yes, I expect so. Sorry, what are the Nix?\nNYSSA: Malevolent water-spirits from another world.\nREMBRANDT: Oh, right, that makes - What did you say?\nKYLE: They know that Tegan, Nyssa and I have been in contact with the Countess. They won’t be able to detect her, so they’1l have tracked us down instead.\nTEGAN: In the hope that we will bring her out of hiding?\nKYLE: That she will surrender herself to save us, yes.\nTEGAN: And will she?\nNYSSA: It’s seeping in through the ceiling.\nNYSSA: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 106\nREMBRANDT: But that’s impossible, I’ve only just had the roof re-grouted.\nNYSSA: It’s not impossible if the water is acting as a medium for an alien life-form.\nREMBRANDT: Oh. This is why I only work with oils!\nTEGAN: But you can ward them off, right, Kyle? Use your dispersion ray, whatever it was?\nKYLE: Up to a point.\nTEGAN: What?\nKYLE: I only have limited power. I can’t hold them back forever.\nKYLE: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 107\nTELDAK: Well, Doctor, do you agree?\nDOCTOR: To take you home? Yes. My craft isn’t far.\nTELDAK: I know. I had it transferred here.\nDOCTOR: You are eager to leave. But I’1l need to pick up my friends First.\nTELDAK: If they had stayed here I would have been able to conceal them\nTELDAK: from the Nix. Now, I sense they have been detected...\nDOCTOR: What? Then I must warn them!\nDOCTOR: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 108\nOPEN: UNDER THE FORCE OF STORM.\nNYSSA: Watch out! The window!\nKYLE: Behind me, all of you. Behind me!\nTEGAN: There’s more of them!\nREMBRANDT: And I thought my life couldn’t get any worse.\nKYLE: It’s about to.\nTEGAN: What?\nKYLE: (WEAK, EFFORT) I need time to recharge. Only enough energy for two more bursts. Then -\nDOCTOR: (BURSTING IN) Ah! There you all are! I thought you might be in trouble.\nDOCTOR: And it turns out I was completely right.\nDOCTOR: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 109\nNYSSA: Doctor, Kyle’s been keeping them back, but -\nDOCTOR: He’s running low on juice. We should get out of here. Kyle, can you clear us a path?\nKYLE: I think so.\nDOCTOR: Alright. Ready, all of you. When I say run, run. Now!\nDOCTOR: Run!!!\nDOCTOR: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 110\nDOCTOR: THEN HALT AT A BRIDGE.\nTEGAN: Where are we going?\nDOCTOR: East India House.\nKYLE: But the Nix will follow us there.\nDOCTOR: Then we’d better hurry. Rembrandt?\nREMBRANDT: Yes, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: The Nix are only interested in us. Keep your head down and they should leave you alone.\nREMBRANDT: Then good luck, Doctor. And your friends.\nDOCTOR: Yes, and you too. Keep up the good work. Must dash!\nDOCTOR: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 111\nPOLSBROEK: This... structure is the means by which you will leave us?\nTELDAK: It is so much more than it appears. Only the most advanced technology could appear so mundane.\nPOLSBROEK: Countess. Will I ever see you again?\nTELDAK: All being well, Polsbroek, this is the end. And no-one regrets that more than I. (KISSES HIM) You understand what you must do?\nPOLSBROEK: I do.\nTELDAK: Then I will be leaving this world in safe hands. Your hands. Let that be my parting gift. A bold new future!\nTELDAK: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 112\nGLAUBER: Who goes there!\nDOCTOR: It’s me, the Doctor.\nGLAUBER: And your two lady-friends. How lovely to be reacquainted.\nTEGAN: For you, maybe.\nNYSSA: We have to get inside.\nKYLE: Nyssa’s right, the Nix are closing in.\nDOCTOR: Captain Glauber, if you could -\nGLAUBER: Indeed, Doctor. In you go.\nGLAUBER: My Arquebusiers will stand guard.\nTEGAN: Against the Nix? Armed with muskets?\nGLAUBER: The Mayor has ordered us to defend this building to the last man.\nKYLE: And there they are.\nTEGAN: (HORRIFIED) There’s dozens of them.\nDOCTOR: Quick! Everyone! Inside!\nDOCTOR: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 113\nGLAUBER: Men! You know what to do. Ready arms. Take aim. Fire!\nGLAUBER: Hold positions! Take aim! Fire!\nGLAUBER: We do not retreat. We do not show fear. We are Dutchmen and if necessary we will die like Dutchmen! ..Fire!\nGLAUBER: You shall not enter. Not while there is breath in my body -\nARE: DROWNING UNDERWATER ALONG WITH HIM.\nARE: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 114\nTELDAK: Doctor, I see you —- (are)\nDOCTOR: No time for niceties. Are you ready to leave?\nTELDAK: Of course, yes.\nDOCTOR: Then inside, all of you! Chop chop!\nTEGAN: Why the mad rush?\nNYSSA: Because the sooner we leave, the sooner the Nix will give up.\nKYLE: Deactivating genetic shield.\nDOCTOR: Good. Now they’1ll detect you leaving, Countess.\nTELDAK: Farewell, Polsbroek.\nPOLSBROEK: Farewell.\nPOLSBROEK: May you find the atonement you desire.\nPOLSBROEK: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 115\nDOCTOR: Setting course for Corus-Valletine, as requested.\nTELDAK: We are not travelling in time?\nDOCTOR: No. You’1l just have to take it as you find it.\nNYSSA: Maybe the Nix will have given up their attack.\nTELDAK: I think that... unlikely.\nTEGAN: But there might be some of your people still alive, somewhere.\nTEGAN: You can’t give up hope.\nTELDAK: You are right. I am not giving up.\nDOCTOR: Geostationary orbit should do it...\nTELDAK: So. I shall set eyes on my world once more. At last.\nTEGAN: (POLITELY DELIVERING BAD NEWS) It’s very... blue.\nDOCTOR: No signs of life. I’m sorry.\nTELDAK: The handiwork of the Nix. My world has been flooded, its destroyed. I am the last of the Vorax.\nTEGAN: You can’t be sure of that.\nTEGAN: people\nTEGAN: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 116\nTELDAK: Oh no. I am sure.\nKYLE: Ours was the only ship to escape.\nNYSSA: You’ve known all along, that you were the only survivor?\nTELDAK: The sole custodian of the legacy of my race.\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry. But I can’t change anything. History has been written.\nTELDAK: I realise that, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: I can drop you off somewhere quiet, if you like -\nTELDAK: No, Doctor. You will take me back to Earth.\nTEGAN: Earth? What do you want to go back there for?\nTELDAK: Not to the time I left. To the future. Kyle?\nKYLE: The year 1983.\nDOCTOR: I’m not sure that’s a terribly good idea.\nTELDAK: I am not asking, Doctor. You will do as I say.\nKYLE: Or Nyssa will die.\nTEGAN: What the -! Kyle!\nTEGAN: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 117\nKYLE: I’m sorry, Tegan. But my allegiance is to the Countess.\nTELDAK: (LAUGHS) He is my servant, more than yours.\nDOCTOR: Countess, whatever you intend -\nTELDAK: One word from me and Kyle will project an energy wave, and your friend will be dead. One word!\nDOCTOR: It won’t work. The TARDIS exists in a state of temporal grace.\nKYLE: The Doctor is lying. I know from Tegan’s memory that energy weapons can be fired in the TARDIS.\nDOCTOR: Alright, alright. Just let Nyssa go.\nTELDAK: I will. When I no longer require your co-operation.\nDOCTOR: There won’t be anything for you in 1983, you know. They’ve only\nDOCTOR: just invented the integrated circuit.\nTELDAK: We shall see.\nDOCTOR: Amsterdam, 1983. As requested.\nTELDAK: You, Tegan. Open the doors.\nTEGAN: You’re not the boss of me.\nTELDAK: Open the doors - or Kyle will kill Nyssa.\nTEGAN: Kyle wouldn’t. Would you, Kyle?\nTEGAN: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 118\nKYLE: I’m sorry, Tegan. Please. Just open the doors.\nTELDAK: Now. Outside. All of you!\nTELDAK: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 119\nTELDAK: RIVERSIDE, DISTANT BIRDS. DOCTOR AND FRIENDS EMERGE.\nTEGAN: I don’t believe it.\nNYSSA: This isn’t the city we left.\nDOCTOR: I’m very much afraid it is.\nTEGAN: What? With airships and giant radio masts?\nKYLE: Those aren’t airships. Don’t you recognise them?\nDOCTOR: Rembrandt’s drawings! Brought to life.\nTELDAK: Humanity has been industrious in our absence.\nDOCTOR: Busy? The whole course of history has been - (changed)\nFANFARE: VIA A LOUDSPEAKER.\nMODERN POLSBROEK: (D)\nMODERN POLSBROEK: Seeking work? Then why not apply for one of the North Venus colonies? Visit your nearest recruitment office for details. Remember, you’re all part of the company. The Dutch Galactic Company!\nTEGAN: That was the Mayor!\nNYSSA: More likely his descendant.\nDOCTOR: It seems the East India company have expanded their horizons. Countess. You knew this would happen?\nDOCTOR: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 120\nTELDAK: All part of my plan. You see, I left instructions, anticipating\nTELDAK: my eventual return.\nTELDAK: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 121\nMODERN GLAUBER: Burgemeister Polsbroek?\nMODERN POLSBROEK: Yes, what is it?\nMODERN GLAUBER: You’re not going to believe it, sir... but she has returned, exactly as predicted.\nMODERN POLSBROEK: The Countess Mach-Teldak?\nMODERN: GLAUBER?: Her arrival was detected in the Centrum sector five minutes ago.\nMODERN POLSBROEK: Dispatch a watch-droid. Have her brought here at once.\nMODERN GLAUBER: (FX: CLICKS HEELS) Yes, sir.\nMODERN POLSBROEK: So after three hundred years, the Countess has finally returned to us...\nMODERN POLSBROEK: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 122\nTEGAN: You mean she’s deliberately changed history?\nDOCTOR: Yes. The Countess left instructions in order to accelerate the human race’s technological development.\nNYSSA: To the point where they could colonise other worlds?\nKYLE: Not just colonise.\nTELDAK: If they have followed my instructions, there should be an entire fleet in orbit. And at my command, they will voyage to the Nix homeworld - and wipe it from existence!\nDOCTOR: Revenge. This is all about revenge!\nTELDAK: They destroyed my world. So I will destroy theirs.\nDROID: Countess Mach-Teldak. Your arrival has been expected.\nTELDAK: Indeed?\nDROID: Burgemeister Polsbroek sends his warm regards and invites you to join him in Galactic Company House.\nTELDAK: Inform him I am on my way.\nTELDAK: But before I go. One last thing. Doctor. You will give me the\nTELDAK: key to the TARDIS.\nDOCTOR: And why would I do that?\nDOCTOR: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL)\nTELDAK: Because now that I have created this timeline,\nTELDAK: Page 123\nTELDAK: I have no wish\nTELDAK: for you to undo it. You and your TARDIS will remain here with\nTELDAK: me.\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid I can’t let you have it.\nTELDAK: No?\nDOCTOR: You’ve already done enough damage. I’m not going to enable you\nDOCTOR: to wreak havoc through all of time and space.\nTELDAK: I can see I’m going to have to demonstrate that I don’t make\nTELDAK: idle threats. Kylex. Kill Nyssa.\nKYLE: Yes, countess.\nNYSSA: What?\nTEGAN: You can’t. Kyle. If you love me, if you ever loved me -\nKYLE: I do but - (MOMENT OF DOUBT, THEN CERTAINTY) I’m sorry, Tegan.\nKYLE: I serve the Countess.\nDOCTOR: No, please, listen, I’1ll give you the key —\nTELDAK: Too late, Doctor. Kill her!\nTEGAN: What have you done? What have you done!\nDOCTOR: (RUSHING TO HELP HER) Nyssa!\nTELDAK: (OVER PRECEDING LINE) Kylex. Confirm the female’s status.\nTELDAK: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 124\nKYLE: Status confirmed. The girl Nyssa is dead.\nKYLE: END OF PART THREE\nKYLE: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 125"

My not-so-loyal servant.\nKYLE: I’ve obeyed you for long enough, Countess.\nTELDAK: And now you obey this Earth woman?\nKYLE: I love her. I have always loved her and I always will.\nTEGAN: Don’t drag me into this.\nTELDAK: (LAUGHS) It appears the feeling is unreciprocated.\nKYLE: It’s still a feeling. The strongest, purest emotion I’ve ever felt.\nKYLE: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 137\nTELDAK: Love conquers all? The robot that thinks he’s a real human boy? I don’t know whether to laugh or retch.\nKYLE: At least I have a reason for living. What do you have to live for? Hatred? Revenge?\nTELDAK: The strongest, purest emotions of all. Now, let me see. Tegan and Nyssa, I can use to sway the Doctor’s hand. But you are superfluous. And betrayal is something I am not inclined to forgive.\nKYLE: I don’t want your forgiveness.\nTELDAK: Then that’s just as well. What interests me is this. You’re capable of generating a defensive force-field. How long, I\nTELDAK: wonder, will it last against the combined firepower of the\nTELDAK: Burgemeister’s watch-droids?\nTELDAK: (OFF-HANDEDLY) Destroy him.\nKYLE: You know, Countess, you’ve made an elementary mistake.\nTELDAK: What?\nKYLE: We’re outdoors.\nKYLE: TEGAN/NYSSA: (REACTING TO BEING DRENCHED) Aargh!\nTEGAN: Rain? No. Not rain...\nTELDAK: The Nix. They are here, they are condensating! All watch- droids. Destroy the water-beings!\nTELDAK: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 138\nDROID: Firepower ineffective! Firepower ineffective!\nTEGAN: (LAUGHS) Bullets, not much good against water.\nNYSSA: They’re everywhere. We’re surrounded.\nTELDAK: Destroy them! Keep firing! Keep firing!\nTELDAK: FUSED-CIRCUITS SPARKS AND EXPLOSIONS. THEN STILL.\nDOCTOR: (ARRIVING) Hello everyone. I hope I haven’t missed all the fun.\nTELDAK: Doctor. So. You have forged an alliance with the Nix.\nDOCTOR: You know how the saying goes. “My enemy’s enemy...”\nTELDAK: They destroyed my world!\nDOCTOR: Then why was there no trace of them when we visited? Water- world, you’d think it was their ideal habitat. No. The Nix didn’t destroy it, Countess. You did.\nTELDAK: Lies. All lies - (SCREAMS AS ATTACKED BY NIX)\nDOCTOR: Don’t kill her. We agreed, she is to remain alive.\nHAVE: DESTROYED ALL THE DROIDS.\nDOCTOR: Thank you. Alright, Nyssa, if you could recover the TARDIS key and open it up, we’1ll carry her inside.\nDOCTOR: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 139\nNYSSA: (FINDS KEY) Got it!\nDOCTOR: Kyle, Tegan, can you deal with the Countess?\nDOCTOR: KYLE/TEGAN: Yes, Doctor. (LIFTS TELDAK)\nDOCTOR: Good, in you go. Nix, thank you for your.. timely intervention.\nNIX: Thank you, Doctor, for your... future co-operation.\nDOCTOR: Although, with any luck, very soon this time-line will cease to have existed. See you earlier!\nSPUTTERING: DROIDS, IT DEMATERIALIZES.\nSPUTTERING: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 140\nTEGAN: So these Nix, they’re the good guys now?\nDOCTOR: Far from it. But we have come to an arrangement.\nTEGAN: What sort of arrangement?\nDOCTOR: The Countess stands trial and the Nix leave Earth.\nKYLE: So we're returning to 1658?\nDOCTOR: Same spatial co-ordinates, a few hours after we left.\nDOCTOR: Tegan, Kyle, if you could take the Countess outside to her chamber, she should be regaining consciousness soon.\nDOCTOR: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 141\nNYSSA: The wall drapes are dry! The Nix have gone.\nDOCTOR: They believe the Countess disappeared in the TARDIS, remember. They would’ve called off their attack the moment we dematerialized.\nTEGAN: (PUTTING DOWN COUNTESS) So how will they know she’s back?\nDOCTOR: Don’t worry, I’ve already taken care of that. They’1ll be here soon enough.\nTEGAN: I don’t much fancy being here when they arrive.\nDOCTOR: No. Tegan, find Rembrandt, we need to make sure he destroys his drawings of “vessels of the stars”.\nTEGAN: Why me?\nDOCTOR: Why not you? (FX: HE LOCKS TARDIS DOOR) Here, look after this. Just in case.\nTEGAN: Alright. (LEAVING)\nDOCTOR: Good. Now, Kyle, Nyssa. When the Nix get here, you must let me do all the talking.\nKYLE: No.\nKYLE: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 142\nDOCTOR: What?\nTELDAK: (RISING UP) If you think I am going to allow myself to be put\nTELDAK: on trial, Doctor, you are very much mistaken.\nDOCTOR: Ah. You’re sitting up and taking notice again, I see.\nKYLE: Far more than that. She has regained psychic control.\nNYSSA: What?\nTELDAK: It seems your friend has had a change of heart.\nKYLE: I am, once again, the Countess’s loyal servant.\nTELDAK: Then you know what to do, don’t you?\nTELDAK: DOCTOR/NYSSA:\nKYLE: Shall I kill them?\nTELDAK: The offer is tempting, but.. no. Not yet.\nTELDAK: I need the Doctor to pilot his craft, and the girl to ensure his co-operation...\nKYLE: Countess, what is it?\nKYLE: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL)\nTELDAK: Page 143\nTELDAK: The craft is locked! Where is the key? Where is it!\nKYLE: The Doctor gave it to Tegan...\nTELDAK: He must have suspected. Where is she?\nKYLE: He sent her to find Rembrandt, just a minute ago\nTELDAK: Then get after her, Kylex. I must have that key! to surrender it - kill the painter.\nKYLE: (LEAVING) Yes, Countess.\nTELDAK: In the meantime, I have a departure to arrange...\nTELDAK: If she\nTELDAK: refuses\nTELDAK: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 144\nTEGAN: (BREATHLESS, READING SIGN) Number four, Jodenbreestraat.\nREMBRANDT: Who is it?\nTEGAN: It’s me, Tegan.\nREMBRANDT: Oh, it’s you. And where’s the rest of your merry band?\nTEGAN: Listen to me. You know your designs for the “vessel of the stars”?\nREMBRANDT: What of them?\nTEGAN: They have to be destroyed.\nTEGAN: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 145\nPOLSBROEK: (RISING FROM SEAT IN SURPRISE) Countess!\nTELDAK: You sound disappointed, Polsbroek.\nPOLSBROEK: No, not at all.. I - I trust nothing has gone wrong...\nTELDAK: There’s no time to explain. Tell me. The spacecraft in the East India Wharf. Is it finished?\nPOLSBROEK: Almost, the focus resonator has yet to be installed -\nTELDAK: You have the necessary crystallized carbon?\nPOLSBROEK: Delivered today from Duarte’s, the purest, polished cut diamonds.\nTELDAK: Excellent. These will suffice.\nPOLSBROEK: Suffice? They cost a King’s ransom -\nTELDAK: They are worth more than that. They are the price of my freedom!\nPOLSBROEK: .You intend to leave in the “spacecraft”?\nTELDAK: Listen. In my chamber are the Doctor and Nyssa and the blue structure. I want them put in the craft’s hold.\nPOLSBROEK: That may be difficult. I lost a great many men last night during the attack, and -\nPOLSBROEK: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 146\nTELDAK: I don’t want excuses, Polsbroek.\nPOLSBROEK: No, of course not, Countess, I shall attend to it at once.\nPOLSBROEK: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 147\nREMBRANDT: My designs? Are you mad? Those are commissions from the Countess, if I don’t deliver them, I won’t get paid.\nTEGAN: But they could change the whole course of history.\nREMBRANDT: My little sketches? I hardly think so —\nREMBRANDT: Another interruption! Am I never to be granted a moment’s peace.\nREMBRANDT: Hello, yes -?\nTEGAN: Kyle! What are you doing here?\nKYLE: (ENTERING) There’s been a change of plan, Rembrandt van Rijn. The Countess is leaving. Your designs are no longer required.\nREMBRANDT: Well you could’ve let me know that earlier!\nTEGAN: What do you mean, the Countess is leaving?\nKYLE: She is about to depart in her spacecraft - along with the your friends and the TARDIS.\nTEGAN: I don’t believe you. You’re lying.\nKYLE: Our minds are psychically linked. Her thoughts are my own and\nKYLE: vice versa. Now. Give me the key.\nTEGAN: What?\nTEGAN: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 148\nKYLE: The TARDIS key. I know that you have it.\nTEGAN: No I don’t.\nKYLE: Don’t lie to me, Tegan. Either you hand it over - or Rembrandt dies!\nKYLE: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 149\nDOCTOR: Nyssa. Wake up!\nNYSSA: (WAKING) What happened?\nDOCTOR: Kyle knocked us out. I suppose we should be grateful he didn’t kill us when he had the chance.\nDOCTOR: NYSSA3: Where are we?\nDOCTOR: Wooden floor, recently planed -\nTELDAK: (ENTERING) Welcome to my spacecraft, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: The Nix know you’re here, Countess. You might as well give yourself up, because they’1ll never let you leave.\nTELDAK: Your TARDIS is stowed in the hold. In the event of the Nix attacking, it will be my means of escape.\nDOCTOR: No can do, I’m afraid. No key.\nTELDAK: Even now Kylex is recovering it. And once he has returned I will leave this accursed world, once and for all!\nTELDAK: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 150\nKYLE: For the last time, Tegan, Give me the key.\nTEGAN: I thought you loved me, Kyle.\nKYLE: I did - I do.\nTEGAN: Until the Countess snaps her fingers and you go running back?\nKYLE: What does it matter to you? You never loved me.\nTEGAN: You’re wrong.\nKYLE: What?\nTEGAN: I loved you, Kyle. Scan my brain if you don’t believe me.\nKYLE: I - (BECOMING HIMSELF) Tegan. No. It’s not true. Why would you lie to me?\nTEGAN: I’m sorry. I just had to keep you looking this way while Rembrandt crept up behind you with - what was that?\nREMBRANDT: Oh, just a self-portrait. I wouldn’t worry, there’s plenty more where that came from.\nREMBRANDT: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 151\nTELDAK: (GASP OF RAGE) No. Kylex!\nDOCTOR: Something the matter?\nTELDAK: He has switched allegiance, back to that woman Tegan!\nNYSSA: Love has an inconvenient habit of overcoming hate.\nTELDAK: It is of no importance. We shall just leave all the sooner. You, come with me to the bridge!\nDOCTOR: And if we refuse?\nTELDAK: I am unfamiliar with the firearms of this century but I daresay I could do a great deal of damage at short range. Now move!\nTELDAK: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 152\nKYLE: There was no need for that. When I scanned your mind, the psychic link with the Countess was broken and my self-control was restored. You set me free.\nREMBRANDT: So you don’t want to kill me?\nKYLE: No. No, of course not.\nTEGAN: Then you can make yourself useful.\nKYLE: Of course, how?\nTEGAN: We still have to destroy all these drawings. I suggest we make a nice, big fire -\nTEGAN: TOPPLE, PLATES FALL FROM SHELVES.\nREMBRANDT: What in heaven’s name is happening?\nKYLE: The countess’s spacecraft, it must be taking off!\nKYLE: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 153\nKYLE: BUTTONS OR BLEEPS. IT IS SHUDDERING UNDER THE STRAIN. FITTINGS\nCOMING: LOOSE. ENGINES DEAFENING.\nTELDAK: It works! I knew it. I knew it!\nDOCTOR: You’re not home and dry yet.\nTELDAK: What do you mean?\nDOCTOR: According to my forecast, you’re in for a spot of bad weather.\nTELDAK: No. Increase the power to the warp drive, Polsbroek!\nPOLSBROEK: Yes, Countess.\nPOLSBROEK: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 154\nBUILDINGS: CREAKING. KYLE AND TEGAN IN MIDST OF CHAOS.\nTEGAN: No. These aren’t ordinary thunderclouds.. it’s the Nix!\nKYLE: They must know the Countess is on board.\nTEGAN: Yes - along with the Doctor and Nyssa!\nTEGAN: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 155\nTEGAN: BY LIGHTNING.\nTELDAK: The Nix are trying to force their way in. Doctor. You alerted them!\nDOCTOR: Guilty as charged. The TARDIS has been transmitting a homing\nDOCTOR: Signal ever since we materialized.\nNYSSA: And you had it brought on board this ship.\nPOLSBROEK: Countess! The warp drive is failing!\nDOCTOR: The Nix must’ve found a way inside.\nPOLSBROEK: .nothing! It’s no good. The engines are dead!\nDOCTOR: And what goes up...\nTELDAK: No. There must be some way of restoring power. There must!\nDOCTOR: The Nix will be here soon. This is your last chance, Countess.\nTELDAK: My last chance for what?\nDOCTOR: To surrender. You’1ll stand trial, I’1ll see to that.\nTELDAK: And what good would a trial do me, Doctor? I’m guilty! Unrepentant and guilty! I wiped out my own craven-hearted race. And given the chance, I’d do it again!\nTELDAK: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 156\nPOLSBROEK: Oh my saints... oh my heavenly father...\nNIX: You are Mach-Teldak of Corus-Valletine?\nTELDAK: I am.\nNIX: You have been sentenced to execution.\nTELDAK: Then do it. (FX: MUSKET CLICKS) But the Doctor dies with me!\nALL: AROUND.\nDOCTOR: Countess. If you were familiar with the firearms of this century, you’d know that flintlock pistols don’t work in damp conditions.\nTELDAK: You will still die, Doctor. As this craft plunges to Earth!\nDOCTOR: Please, Countess, surrender!\nNYSSA: It’s too late, Doctor. She’s dead.\nDOCTOR: (TO NIX, RESTRAINED ANGER) That was unnecessary!\nNIX: No. She would have killed you. We saved your life.\nFITTINGS: RATTLING, RUSH OF WIND OUTSIDE GROWING IN VOLUME.\nPOLSBROEK: Which is something of a moot point, given that we are about to crash. Altitude, six thousand feet.\nDOCTOR: Nix. Can you re-energise the engines?\nDOCTOR: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 157\nNIX: That is.. not possible.\nPOLSBROEK: Altitude, four thousand feet. (WRENCHES LEVER) But if we can raise the prow we might just be able to reach the Zeider Zee.\nDOCTOR: Then let’s try that, shall we? (WRENCHES LEVER)\nPOLSBROEK: (WRENCHING AT CONTROLS) Two thousand feet.\nNYSSA: Doctor, what about the TARDIS?\nDOCTOR: Unfortunately Tegan has the only key.\nNYSSA: You mean there’s no way off this ship?\nDOCTOR: Unless the Countess included an escape capsule. Did she?\nPOLSBROEK: I’m afraid not. One thousand feet. We’re flying over the docks - and open sea!\nDOCTOR: (REFLECTING ON IMMINENT DEMISE) Then that’s something. When we hit the water, no-one else will die.\nDOCTOR: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 158\nDOCTOR: COMBINED WITH AN EXPLOSION.\nDOCTOR: WE MOVE TO THE WHARF, SEAGULLS CAWKING, WAVES CRASHING AGAINST THE SEA WALL. WORKERS REACTING. TEGAN AND KYLE RUSH UP TO US.\nKYLE: It’s gone. The whole ship.. completely destroyed.\nTEGAN: (BREAKING DOWN) But the Doctor and Nyssa were in there!\nKYLE: (HE HUGS HER) Yes. I’m sorry.\nTEGAN: (TEARFULLY) So stupid. Why did they have to get themselves killed!\nKYLE: They saved the city... and history will revert to -\nTEGAN: I don’t care about history. I’ve lost my friends!\nKYLE: I know.\nTEGAN: And now I’m stuck here, in the.. middle ages or whenever it is.\nKYLE: (SEES SOMETHING) Wait. Look! Something’s coming to the surface!\nTEGAN: (SEES) The TARDIS! I never knew it could float. And some sort of.. ball of water?\nKYLE: The Nix. They must be creating it.\nTEGAN: There’s something inside it - the Doctor and Nyssa! They’re\nTEGAN: alive!\nTEGAN: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 159 DOCTOR/NYSSA/POLSBROEK:\nTEGAN: Doctor! Nyssa! Are you alright?\nDOCTOR: Fine. More or less unharmed, I think?\nNYSSA: The Nix immersed us in a protective bubble to save us from the impact.\nTEGAN: And the Mayor too, by the look of it.\nPOLSBROEK: (COUGHS UP WATER) I am never, ever leaving dry land ever again.\nKYLE: What about the Countess?\nDOCTOR: Dead, I’m afraid. You’re free of her forever, Kyle. Your life\nDOCTOR: is your own.\nDOCTOR: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 160\nREMBRANDT: Doctor, if you will do the honours?\nDOCTOR: No, Rembrandt. The honour should be yours.\nREMBRANDT: Very well. “I hereby consign this “vessel of the stars” to the flames”.\nTEGAN: That’s all the drawings destroyed?\nREMBRANDT: Every last one. I shall have to return to scraping a living, painting merchants, their wives and fancy-women.\nKYLE: You’re still going to have to move out?\nNYSSA: It’s such a pity. This house means so much to you.\nREMBRANDT: It does. It holds so many memories. So many shadows. But perhaps it is time I opened the shutters, and let in the light. A fresh start.\nTEGAN: You will be remembered, you know. In the future, you’re considered one of the greatest artists that ever lived.\nREMBRANDT: So I am told, but posterity does not, alas, put bread on my table.\nDOCTOR: No, but this might.\nREMBRANDT: Where did you -\nREMBRANDT: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 161\nDOCTOR: From the “vessel of the stars”, it was part of the focus resonator. Consider it a.. token of esteem from the future.\nREMBRANDT: Rather more than a token!\nDOCTOR: Then consider it something to put aside for a rainy day.\nREMBRANDT: We have certainly had more than our fair share of those recently.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Well. We should be going.\nREMBRANDT: Back to, when was it?\nTEGAN: 1983.\nREMBRANDT: Yes, yes. Then be off with you!\nREMBRANDT: TEGAN/NYSSA/KYLE: What?\nREMBRANDT: Out! No dawdling! Out you go!\nDOCTOR: But -\nREMBRANDT: I’m a very busy man. I have work to do! If there’s one thing I cannot abide, it is all these interminable interruptions!\nREMBRANDT: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 162\nNYSSA: It’s all back to how it was.\nDOCTOR: Thankfully. It seems Mayor Polsbroek was reluctant to build any more “vessels of the stars”.\nTEGAN: (LAUGHS) After what happened, do you blame him?\nKYLE: And with Rembrandt’s drawings destroyed.. there’s no exhibition at the Rijksmuseum.\nDOCTOR: Yes, well, I can’t help feeling they weren’t really his style. Anyway, now we’re here...\nKYLE: Time to say goodbye.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Unless you want to join us?\nTEGAN: What?\nKYLE: Don’t worry. I have no intention of going with you. You go, travel in time and space. Have fun. You deserve it.\nTEGAN: I’m not sure “fun” is the right word.\nNYSSA: Doctor, shouldn’t we get back to the TARDIS?\nDOCTOR: Hmmm?\nNYSSA: You know, to check the... dimensional stabiliser.\nNYSSA: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 163\nDOCTOR: Why would we do that, it was working perfectly when we - (REALIZES) Oh! Yes. I see. Yes, we should check the dimensional stabiliser, at once!\nNYSSA: Tegan, we’ll wait for you in the TARDIS. Goodbye Kyle.\nDOCTOR: Yes, good luck with everything.\nKYLE: Goodbye Doctor, Nyssa. And thanks.\nTEGAN: So this is it. The last goodbye.\nKYLE: Yes.\nTEGAN: I’m sorry. That it didn’t work out. That I’m not the person you wanted me to be.\nKYLE: I’m sorry I’m not the person you wanted me to be either.\nTEGAN: Which is nobody’s fault. Just how it is.\nKYLE: That’s life, I suppose. I’1ll have to get used to it.\nTEGAN: I can still have a word with the Doctor. I’m sure he could reprogramme you to forget you ever loved me.\nKYLE: I wouldn’t want him to.\nTEGAN: But why? If I was in your shoes, I would.\nKYLE: Because if it happened with you, it will happen again. With someone who will love me back, hopefully.\nTEGAN: Good luck finding that someone.\nTEGAN: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 164\nKYLE: I’m going to keep looking until I do. You know me. Determined.\nTEGAN: Let’s hope it doesn’t take three hundred years this time.\nKYLE: (LAUGHS) Yes.\nTEGAN: But one thing. When you do find someone, be honest with them. About everything, good and bad.\nKYLE: I will.\nTEGAN: Because only then will there be a chance they’1l fall in love\nTEGAN: with you too.\nKYLE: I think I’ve learned my lesson. Thanks to you, Tegan.\nTEGAN: Goodbye, Kyle. (KISSES HIM) Have a good life.\nKYLE: (TO HIMSELF) Goodbye, Tegan. (BEAT) But it’s a big old world, Kyle. The sooner you get started, the better...\nKYLE: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 165\nHURRIES: TOWARDS US.\nTEGAN: Nyssa. What are you doing out here? Where’s the Doctor?\nNYSSA: Inside the TARDIS. He wanted to check there was no water damage to its defensive mechanisms.\nTEGAN: I can see why you’d want to leave him to it.\nNYSSA: How did it go, with Kyle?\nTEGAN: About as well as could be hoped. I’m just glad that it’s all over.\nNYSSA: So you’re sure you want to travel with me and the Doctor again?\nTEGAN: More sure than I’ve ever been of anything in my life. You know, for one terrible moment back there, I thought you two might leave without me.\nNYSSA: (LAUGHS) Don’t worry, that will never happen again.\nTEGAN: What the —\nNYSSA: The TARDIS is dematerializing!\nTEGAN: Without us! Doctor! Doctor!\nNYSSA: But he wouldn’t leave us behind... unless something had forced him to.\nNYSSA: THE WATERS OF AMSTERDAM by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 166\nTEGAN: Wouldn’t he? Strikes me it’s just the sort thing he would do. (CALLING) Hey, Doctor. Now you listen to me. You can haul yourself back here, right this minute!\nNYSSA: (INCREDULOUS) He seems to have heard you.\nDOCTOR: Sorry about that, had to run a quick errand for the Time Lords. What? What is it? Did you miss me?\nDOCTOR: END OF PART FOUR"
