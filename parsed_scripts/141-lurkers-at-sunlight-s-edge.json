Cold.\nDOCTOR: Well — not Alaska precisely, rather an island off its Northern coast. An island that wasn’t here four years, three months and Six days ago. Hence the appeal of coming here.\nHEX: Yeah. Hugely appealing.\nACE: It wasn’t here? What is it? Volcanic?\nDOCTOR: Hard to tell, with the bedrock so covered in snow and ice...\nHEX: Yeah.

Ahead of you! Sir!\nWHYTECRAG: (RUNNING OVER) What is it, Slade?\nSLADE: Ice! A massive pillar of ice!\nACE: More like a frozen fountain.

Can’t judge the distance, mind. A mountain-?\nDOCTOR: No. Some other structure.\nACE: It’s a building. A building the size of St Paul’s!\nWHY TECRAG: More than three times the size.

A door in need of a key.\nHEX: The frozen umbrella!\nDOCTOR: Precisely.\nWHY TECRAG: Beyond this door, Doctor, waits the world’s salvation. And I am the man to bring the world that salvation!\nHEX: You sure that sixty-foot high door is big enough for your head to fit through?\nWHYTECRAG: My, you’re a witty young man, aren’t you? Slade —\nSLADE: (STEPPING FORWARD) Sir.\nHEX: Alright, I was only yanking your [chain] — (FX: HEX HIT IN STOMACH.) Oof!\nACE: Oi, leave him be! (HELPING HEX UP) You alright, Hex?\nHEX: (GASPING) Well, that took the wind right out of me — sails.\nWHY TECRAG: Here’s a witticism of my own, Nurse Schofield. Why don’t you open the door?\nHEX: What-?\nWHY TECRAG: Slade — give him the key.\nDOCTOR WHO: LURKERS AT SUNLIGHT’S EDGE by Marty Ross (FINAL) Page 17\nDOCTOR: (STEPPING FORWARD) I should like to volunteer.\nSLADE: (TO WHYTECRAG) Sir-?\nWHYTECRAG: Very well.\nDOCTOR: (TAKING KEY) Thank you, Mr Slade.\nACE: (SOTTO) Doctor, you sure about this-?\nDOCTOR: There’s just one thing puzzles me, Mr Whytecrag. The door is immense. Yet that... orifice there, if that’s the lock...\nHEX: (REALISATION) It’s human height. Why’s it human height?\nWHYTECRAG: Open the door, Doctor. And the mysteries of this place will\nWHYTECRAG: begin to resolve themselves.\nWHYTECRAG: (FX: MUFFLED, FROM BEHIND CITADEL WALLS, A DISTANT ANIMALISTIC SOUND, ALMOST LIKE A DISTORTED WHALE-CRY. )\nACE: What was that?\nDOCTOR: Something beyond the door. Something deep inside.\nCORBIN: (APPROACHING) The dreamers! The dreamers in the vault!\nACE: Doctor — over there!\nHEX: Yeah, the feller who dropped the key.\nCORBIN: Get back! Get back or I’1l shoot!\nWHYTECRAG: Corbin-?\nDOCTOR WHO: LURKERS AT SUNLIGHT’S EDGE by Marty Ross (FINAL) Page 18\nCORBIN: Back, or you’re dead! Dead as my party! Dead as my men!\nDOCTOR: Professor Corbin. Tell me what happened here.\nCORBIN: What happened? Why, we barely opened the door before something woke within. From the darkness, it cried out, even as I forced the door shut again. But that cry stirred this mist into a storm, whipping my men off the ground and freezing them to death. If that can happen out here, what might happen inside?\nWHY TECRAG: I’m prepared for what might happen inside. Which is why you were to wait for me before opening the door!\nCORBIN: Whytecrag — those things in there... they demand sacrifice!\nWHY TECRAG: Then sacrifice is what we shall provide. Three times over, if necessary. You see the sacrifices we’ve picked up en route?\nHEX: Uh-oh.\nWHY TECRAG: Astonish me, Corbin. Tell me these three were genuinely part of your expedition.\nCORBIN: No. I saw them before, by the north coast. They arrived out of the air, in an English policeman’s box. Only white...\nWHY TECRAG: Military police. I thought as much. — Slade, move all three towards the door.\nSLADE: You heard him! Move!\nACE: Alright, alright!\nCORBIN: (TO WHYTECRAG) I told you, Whytecrag — I want all of us away from here. (BEAT) I’11 shoot!\nWHYTECRAG: Oh, Corbin.

(STEPPING OUT ONTO ICE) Just watch your — [step!] (STOPPING SHORT) Oh no.\nDOCTOR: Problem?\nACE: No, it’s just there’s a crevasse here that’d make Cheddar Gorge feel inadequate.\nHEX: Watch yourself, Ace.\nACE: (STEPPING FORWARD WARILY) It’s alright.

How far down do you reckon it goes?\nDOCTOR: (TO HEX) Take the key, Mister Hex. I’m going down.\nHEX: You’re kidding.

I can’t face it again.\nDOCTOR WHO: LURKERS AT SUNLIGHT’S EDGE by Marty Ross (FINAL) Page 28\nWHYTECRAG: You can face my bullet, if you’d prefer.\nHEX: Come on, Prof. Stick with me. The stench this lot gives off’s a bit much for standing close to.\nWHYTECRAG: (MOVING OFF) The rest of you, behind those rocks there! Now!\nCORBIN: Now here’s the lock.\nHEX: Doesn’t look like a lock. Mind, the door doesn’t look like a door. More like a great row of twisted fangs, laid on end.\nCORBIN: The culture that produced this architecture created their buildings as... as caterpillars spin cocoons. Vomiting whole cities into being.\nHEX: That explains a lot about the design work.\nCORBIN: You, ah... slot the key in the... um... socket.\nHEX: Arm included?\nCORBIN: I’m afraid so.\nHEX: Alright, here goes nothing... (FX: LOW, SQUELCHY SOUND.) Ohhh, why do I feel like a vet in a cowshed?\nCORBIN: Now, you should feel a bit of a pull...\nHEX: A pull? It sucked my whole arm in!\nCORBIN: Don’t worry, that’s what’s supposed to happen.\nDOCTOR WHO: LURKERS AT SUNLIGHT’S EDGE by Marty Ross (FINAL) Page 29\nHEX: Don’t worry?!\nCORBIN: The building is a living thing. It’s evaluating you and the key.\nHEX: What happens when it reaches a decision? (FX: LOUD SQUELCH! ) OWWWW!!! Twisting me whole arm around...\nCORBIN: Yes, the mechanism wasn’t designed for the ball and socket of the human shoulder joint.\nHEX: Now the other way...\nCORBIN: It means it’s accepted you.\nHEX: I’m so flattered. How long before it rips me whole arm off? (FX: SQUELCH OF ARM BEING RELEASED.) At last, it’s letting me arm go.\nCORBIN: The key should just — slide off.\nHEX: (SLIDING KEY OFF ARM) Yeah. Is that it, then-?\nCORBIN: Hardly.\nHEX: The fangs. They’re pulling apart!\nCORBIN: The door is opening. I’m so sorry, Nurse Schofield.\nCORBIN: (FX: DOOR OPENING SOUND CEASES. FOR A MOMENT, NO SOUND BUT THE\nLOW: MURMUR OF THE ICY WIND. )\nCORBIN: Nothing. Nothing. The door opened. But nothing happened.\nDOCTOR WHO: LURKERS AT SUNLIGHT’S EDGE by Marty Ross (FINAL) Page 30\nHEX: Well, that’s a good thing, right...?\nCORBIN: Not necessarily... Now we have to go —\nWHYTECRAG: (FROM OFF, TO HIS MEN) Inside! All of you! The way’s clear!\nDOCTOR WHO: LURKERS AT SUNLIGHT’S EDGE by Marty Ross (FINAL) Page 31\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 13: INT. NEAR MOUTH OF CAVE\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: A SHORT WAY OFF, SOUND OF ROCK SCRAPING AWAY AT STONE,\nPLUS: DOVEDAY'S VOICE. FURTHER AWAY, FAINT SOUND OF WAVES ON SHORE. ACE AND DOCTOR'S STEPS APPROACHING, STOPPING. )\nDOVEDAY: (DISTANT) Araka — araka-hi...\nACE: Doctor, up ahead...\nDOCTOR: Shhhh! (WHISPER) Whoever or whatever’s making those sounds is just round the next bend.\nACE: (WHISPER) So is what looks like daylight. Don’t you think?\nDOCTOR: (WHISPER) Hence that peculiar shadow. Let’s ease ourselves around this corner and see what’s at the root of it.\nACE: (WHISPER) If it’s got more than one head, I quit.\nDOCTOR: (WHISPER) (STEPPING FORWARD) Just shine the torch around and -\nDOVEDAY: Ahhra-kah-takkkahhhh...- (SPOOKED) No! No!!! (FX: RUNS OFF)\nACE: There it goes! Outside!\nDOCTOR: It? It was a man.\nACE: Only glimpsed one head, so... yeah, I guess. Let’s catch up and confirm the fact.\nDOCTOR: Wait. Wait! The cavern wall here. Look!\nACE: It’s just — I dunno, words?\nDOCTOR: Words like those he was muttering to himself. Scraped into the cave wall with a sharp-edged stone.\nDOCTOR WHO: LURKERS AT SUNLIGHT’S EDGE by Marty Ross (FINAL) Page 32\nACE: (READING) Ar... kih.. What is it? Eskimo?\nDOCTOR: No Inuit language, no.\nACE: Oh, right. Alien.\nDOCTOR: More than alien, Ace. This is language that should not be spoken. Language that predates known history. Language of the Old Times. (GRIMLY) Let’s go.\nDOCTOR WHO: LURKERS AT SUNLIGHT’S EDGE by Marty Ross (FINAL) Page 33\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 14. INT. CITADEL ENTRANCEWAY/PASSAGE\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: MANY FOOTSTEPS RUNNING ONTO SOLID FLOOR OF INTERIOR. IN THIS, AS IN ALL CITADEL INTERIORS, LOTS OF ECHO, PLUS CONSTANT LOW-LEVEL AMBIENT SOUNDS TO SUGGEST THE ‘BREATHING’ OF THE WALLS. )\nWHYTECRAG: Let’s get those flares lit, Slade!\nSLADE: Yes, sir!\nWHYTECRAG: Who was that? Slade!\nSLADE: Kinney! Calm down, man!\nKINNEY: Look, sir, all around us!\nCORBIN: (WALKING FORWARD) Yes, yes! The thousand eyes in the dark!\nHEX: They’re like.. fish eyes. Growing out of the wall.\nCORBIN: I told you, this whole structure is a living thing. Here, among the eyes —\nHEX: . mouths?\nCORBIN: Those curling sockets, they’re a form of ear. Now the text would have it that...\nWHY TECRAG: Here we are, Professor. “”.. and the monstrous eyes glowering from the ebon-dark of that cyclopean architecture demanded Sight of the pages of the necromantic text which had led me thus far...” Here you go, Corbin. Show the eyes our sacred text.\nDOCTOR WHO: LURKERS AT SUNLIGHT’S EDGE by Marty Ross (FINAL) Page 34\nHEX: What is that book?\nWHYTECRAG: Its contents can roughly be translated as ‘none of your damned business’.\nCORBIN: Now... (FX: FLICKING PAGES) “Likewise, the ears of that labyrinthine brain had to hear the arcane incantation of entry...” Let me see, yes... “Mor’eftsa oak-arya!” and, um, “those cacodemoniacal mouths demanded a taste of human blood.”\nWHYTECRAG: Blood, yes. Slade, a little cut to this Hex fellow’s hand.\nHEX: Get off!\nCORBIN: Leave him! My blood’s good enough. And I have only myself to blame for being here. — Knife, Slade!\nSLADE: Here...\nCORBIN: Thank you. Take the book. Now, I’m hoping the place will be satisfied with just a little - (CUTTING HIMSELF, PAINED) — sip, so to speak.\nHEX: Watch yourself, Prof.\nCORBIN: This shouldn’t be too dangerous. That’s if I’ve interpreted the... uggghhh... text correctly.\nCORBIN: (FX: HISSING, SLIMY SOUND OF FLOOR OPENING: A BIT LIKE\nPREVIOUS: EFFECT OF DOOR OPENING. )\nSLADE: There, sir — the floor! Opening up!\nWHYTECRAG: The entrance to a tunnel! You, lad, take the lead again!\nCORBIN: No! Wait!\nDOCTOR WHO: LURKERS AT SUNLIGHT’S EDGE by Marty Ross (FINAL) Page 35\nWHY TECRAG: I’ve waited long enough! And the dreamers have waited centuries more! We’re going! Now!\nSLADE: (TO HEX) You heard the man! Get down there!\nHEX: Alright, alright, I’m going! (FX: SQUELCHY FOOTSTEPS DESCENDING.) Uuurgh, pretty slimy coming down.\nCORBIN: Give the boy some light.\nWHYTECRAG: Slade!\nSLADE: Sir!\nSLADE: (FX: ANOTHER FLARE LIT AND THROWN, BOUNCING AND ROLLING, DOWN PASSAGEWAY. )\nWHY TECRAG: Well? What can you see?\nHEX: Nothing. The passage just leads into — dark.\nWHY TECRAG: Bring the men through, Slade-!\nSLADE: Go on then, the lot of yer!\nWHY TECRAG: (FOLLOWING) Follow me, Corbin.\nCORBIN: (WALKING) This is — this is madness!\nWHYTECRAG: Madness, or death — for the unworthy, maybe. For such as myself.. a whole new form of sanity, perhaps. (TO SLADE) All the men through, Slade?\nSLADE: Last man coming through now, sir. —\nCORBIN: Look! The entranceway!\nDOCTOR WHO: LURKERS AT SUNLIGHT’S EDGE by Marty Ross (FINAL) Page 36\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: SOUND OF THE OPENING ABOVE CLOSING SWIFTLY WITH THE SAME SORT OF SLIMY SOUND AS IT MADE OPENING. )\nHEX: (COMING BACK TO MEET THE OTHERS) Hey, what’s happening?\nCORBIN: I warned you, Whytecrag! The place itself has sealed us in!\nWHY TECRAG: Then there’s only one way to go, gentlemen!\nHEX: Towards that, in other words...\nWHY TECRAG: Lead the way, Mr Hex!\nHEX: What is that? Professor?\nCORBIN: The sound of some alien nightmare. A nightmare we’ll all be\nCORBIN: made to share!\nCORBIN: END OF PART ONE\nDOCTOR WHO: LURKERS AT SUNLIGHT’S EDGE by Marty Ross (FINAL) Page 37"

Found our way into that cave.\nDOVEDAY: Oh yes?\nACE: A little scary in there.\nDOVEDAY: You’re telling me.\nDOCTOR: Been in there yourself, have you?\nDOVEDAY: Never more than a few steps. Before hurrying straight out.\nACE: Why? Saw something you didn’t like?\nDOVEDAY: Only, I dare say, in my overactive imagination. I used to write horror tales for a living. So I’m the sort of fellow least well advised to go wandering into such a place.\nDOCTOR: Then you weren’t wandering around in there a moment ago?\nDOCTOR WHO: LURKERS AT SUNLIGHT’S EDGE by Marty Ross (FINAL) Page 39\nDOVEDAY: Oh dear me, no. I’ve been sat here some while, letting my mind drift with the spray off the waves, struggling to fill the pages of my notebook. I’m often seized by a need to scribble down my thoughts. As the only way of making sense of them.\nACE: What are you writing? A horror story?\nDOVEDAY: Heaven forbid! Heaven or the Institute, at the very least.\nDOCTOR: Ah, yes. The Institute. The collection of buildings on the cliff path above, I presume-?\nACE: What buildings-? (DOUBLE-TAKE) Oh, yeah!\nDOVEDAY: I’m under strict orders to refocus my slender talent on more upbeat literary endeavours. Whenever I come up with anything particularly lightweight and untroubling, Doctor Gabriel encourages me to read it out to the patients. You’ve met Doctor Gabriel?\nDOCTOR: Doctor Gabriel? Oh yes, splendid chap.\nDOVEDAY: Chap? I’d scarcely have called her that.\nACE: Oh, the Doctor here, he’s very old school. Can’t get used to us women getting in on the act.\nDOVEDAY: Well, if Doctor Gabriel is anything to go by, there ought to be more ladies doing her job. She certainly cured me.\nDOCTOR: Cured... yet still with the Institute?\nDOVEDAY: Well, I’m showing my gratitude by working for her here as her assistant, a sort of psychiatric factotum. The name’s C.P. Doveday, by the way.\nDOCTOR: (FAINT RECOGNITION) Doveday?\nDOCTOR WHO: LURKERS AT SUNLIGHT’S EDGE by Marty Ross (FINAL) Page 40\nDOVEDAY: Call me C.P., please. It stands for Clarence Penrose, but neither name strikes me as particularly aesthetic.\nDOCTOR: Oh yes, of course. I’ve read something of yours before, haven’t I?\nDOVEDAY: I hope not. Confronted with my previous literary endeavours, a less liberal head shrinker than Doctor Gabriel might reach for the strait-waistcoat.\nACE: Don’t worry, the Doctor here is more interested in expanding minds than shrinking heads.\nDOCTOR: Quite. Alas, our two heads together have failed to work out the best route from the beach here up to the Institute.\nDOVEDAY: Well, it’s not a place, I suppose, that advertises its presence. Come, I’11 show you the way. Any excuse to give up writing tenth-rate poetry for the day. Follow me.\nACE: (UNDER HER BREATH) Doctor...? Sticking out of his pocket there... that isn’t a rock, is it?\nDOCTOR: You mean like the one that might have scraped out those words\nDOCTOR: on the cavern wall? Quite conceivably.\nDOCTOR WHO: LURKERS AT SUNLIGHT’S EDGE by Marty Ross (FINAL) Page 41\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 16: EXT. TOP OF CLIFF\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: BEACH SOUNDS, NOW HEARD FROM MUCH FURTHER AWAY. WHINING OF OLD-FASHIONED SHORT WAVE RADIO. )\nAKINS: Akins on look-out, calling Doctor Gabriel. Look-out calling — Doctor Gabriel? Yes, uh, we have a problem. A couple of strangers just showed up on the beach and made contact with our Mr Doveday. All three now making their way up the cliff. The two newcomers are in close proximity to Doveday, so advise caution. Repeat: advise caution.\nDOCTOR WHO: LURKERS AT SUNLIGHT’S EDGE by Marty Ross (FINAL) Page 42\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 17: INT. CITADEL — DESCENT TO BONE TUNNEL\nSLADE: (APPROACHING DOWN TUNNEL, TOWARDS REAR) Careful, men — the descent gets steep here!\nHEX: (WALKING) At least there’s a bit more light down this way, Prof. Where it’s coming from, I don’t know. Seems to be glowing all along the walls.\nCORBIN: (WALKING) Yes, some sort of phosphorence. The sort of thing produced by the decay of certain marine animals.\nHEX: Talking of decaying animals...\nWHYTECRAG: (APPROACHING) What is all this?\nHEX: Bones. Filling the whole tunnel.\nWHYTECRAG: Bones?\nCORBIN: Discarded from bygone feasts. (FX: RATTLE OF CORBIN INSPECTING BONES.) This here is plainly walrus. The avian skulls can only be penguin. And this, along here...\nHEX: (SPOTTING HUMAN SKULL) Oh, wait a minute...\nCORBIN: Blue whale, most likely.\nHEX: Here, Prof... I know a human skull when I see one.\nCORBIN: Eskimo, almost certainly.\nWHYTECRAG: The detritus from a few fish and Arctic aborigines. This is not what we’re here for. (FX: FLICKING PAGES) Let us return to the text.\nDOCTOR WHO: LURKERS AT SUNLIGHT’S EDGE by Marty Ross (FINAL) Page 43\nCORBIN: Never mind the text, Whytecrag! These bones are a reminder of the power we’re dealing with.\nHEX: What power?\nWHYTECRAG: If it takes a citadel as vast as this to contain such power, Nurse Schofield, how could space possibly be made for it within that head of yours?\nHEX: You'd be surprised.\nWHYTECRAG: Would I? How?\nHEX: I might just be the person here with the most experience of this sort of thing. Now you’ve gone and murdered my friends, anyhow. So why don’t you give us a look at that precious text of yours?\nWHYTECRAG: It would be unbecoming for such a document to be marred by the thumbprints of a scruffy interloper.\nCORBIN: Let him see, Whytecrag. It’s unfair not to prepare him.\nWHYTECRAG: No!\nCORBIN: You and I were supposed to be collaborators. Equals! My opinion in the matter ought to count for at least as much as yours.\nWHYTECRAG: You and I, Professor — equals? I confess I had need of a fly on the Institute’s walls. But in no sense could that fly be my equal.\nCORBIN: How dare you — in the face of all I have undergone — I ought to tear that damned text to shreds! Give me it!\nWHY TECRAG: Get off! Slade — help me!\nDOCTOR WHO: LURKERS AT SUNLIGHT’S EDGE by Marty Ross (FINAL) Page 44\nCORBIN: There! (THROWING BOOK) Hex — take it!\nHEX: (CATCHING BOOK) Got it!\nWHYTECRAG: Slade!\nSLADE: Give that back!\nHEX: (TURNING PAGES) Let me just see.. (BEAT; READING) What?!?\nSLADE: Give it — BACK!\nHEX: Oof!\nCORBIN: Leave him, you thug! (BEAT) Are you [alright?]\nHEX: (WINDED) I’m fine, Prof. Live to fight another day.\nSLADE: (RETURNING BOOK) Here you are, sir. Not too many thumbprints.\nHEX: I don’t understand, Whytecrag. I thought it was some ancient mystic text you had there.\nWHY TECRAG: Mystic, yes. Ancient, not quite.\nHEX: It’s just some cheesy old horror magazine in a posh binder. “Shuddersome Tales”. What’s that story it was open at? ‘The Icy Something of the Monster Somethings...’\nCORBIN: ‘In The Icy Citadel Of The Monstrous Gods’. By —\nHEX: I saw. C.P. Doveday. Who the hell is C.P. Doveday?\nCORBIN: At the risk of hyperbole, I'd say he was the most dangerous man on the planet. If man he is.\nDOCTOR WHO: LURKERS AT SUNLIGHT’S EDGE by Marty Ross (FINAL) Page 45\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 18: INT. INSTITUTE HALLWAY\nDOVEDAY: Come in. Just through here.\nDOCTOR: This looks cosy, Mr Doveday. Quite a contrast to the exterior.\nDOVEDAY: Out there, the place looks like a military bunker. (FX: CLOSES DOOR) But in here, we try to make it a good deal more ‘homey’ for the patients.\nACE: And where are the patients?\nDOVEDAY: The work here is rather experimental. Hence the need for a degree of secrecy. Oh, Doctor Gabriel!\nFREYA: (APPROACHING) Hello there, C.P. Brought a couple of new arrivals, I see.\nDOVEDAY: Yes. Two of your colleagues. Doctors McShane and, um...\nDOCTOR: Hope we’ve not caught you on the hoof dropping in like this.\nFREYA: Not at all. I’m Doctor Freya Gabriel, chief psychiatrist. You sound English. Can I interest you in a cup of tea?\nACE: After the morning we’ve had, you bet.\nDOCTOR: I’d be more interested in a tour of your Institute, secrecy permitting.\nFREYA: I’m sure you would. — (BEAT) Feeling better, C.P.?\nDOVEDAY: Yes, apologies for my funny turn earlier. Don’t know what came over me. I did find myself scribbling another poem on my favourite rock, if you’d like to see-? (FX: NOTEPAD PULLED\nFROM: DOVEDAY’S POCKET.) It’s not terribly good. Somewhat sentimental.\nDOCTOR WHO: LURKERS AT SUNLIGHT’S EDGE by Marty Ross (FINAL) Page 46\nFREYA: That’s not a sin in poetry, despite what the bohemians you left behind in New York might say. You should read it to the patients at our next group session. Now — you’re looking a little tired. Why don’t you go and lie down?\nDOVEDAY: I thought —\nDOVEDAY: FREYAs: Yes?\nDOVEDAY: Since Doctor McShane sounded so keen on that cup of tea, I thought I might serve it up in the sun lounge, show off the view from up there.\nFREYA: I really think a nap would be a good idea after such a stressful morning.\nDOVEDAY: All the more reason to have a pleasant afternoon, surely? And it’s not like I’m a patient here, after all.\nDOVEDAY: FREYAs: Of course not.\nDOVEDAY: I’m here to help, of my own free will. And of my own free will, I’d like to take Doctor McShane upstairs to the sun lounge.\nACE: If it’s a problem, I...\nDOVEDAY: Please!\nFREYA: Whatever you like, C.P. You know how important it is to me that you feel happy, settled and at home here.\nDOVEDAY: Oh, I do. I haven’t felt more at home anywhere else, in the longest time. — Doctor McShane? The sun lounge is this way?\nACE: Thank you.\nDOCTOR: Take care, Doctor McShane.\nDOCTOR WHO: LURKERS AT SUNLIGHT’S EDGE by Marty Ross (FINAL) Page 47\nACE: (MOVING OFF) I will if you will.\nFREYA: A tour, then, Doctor...?\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nDOCTOR: FREYAs: Come with me.\nDOCTOR WHO: LURKERS AT SUNLIGHT’S EDGE by Marty Ross (FINAL) Page 48\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 19: INT. INSTITUTE CORRIDOR\nDOVEDAY: It is lovely in the sun lounge. The view through the windows is a rest cure in itself.\nACE: Good, good. There were one or two things I was hoping to ask you about this island...?\nACE: (FX: EXTERNAL DOOR OPENS. BIT OF EXTERIOR ACOUSTIC AS AKINS ENTERS AND CLOSES THE DOOR. )\nDOVEDAY: Hello there, Mr Akins. Bracing out there, hmm?\nAKINS: C.P. Where are you off to?\nDOVEDAY: Oh, just upstairs to the sun lounge.\nAKINS: You have company.\nDOVEDAY: Yes, this is Doctor McShane...\nACE: Hi.\nAKINS: You have authorisation, C.P.?\nDOVEDAY: Authorisation?\nAKINS: From Doctor Gabriel. Authorisation to go wandering about the place with a complete stranger?\nDOVEDAY: With a Doctor, here to help us. And Doctor Gabriel did authorise our going upstairs, if authorisation were needed.\nAKINS: You’re a Doctor?\nACE: Yes.\nDOCTOR WHO: LURKERS AT SUNLIGHT’S EDGE by Marty Ross (FINAL) Page 49\nAKINS: Prove it.\nACE: What do you want me to do? Saw your leg off, or offer a Freudian analysis of your suspicious mind?\nAKINS: Simpler still, why don’t we go to Doctor Gabriel’s office?\nDOVEDAY: You’re being somewhat high-handed for a hospital orderly, Akins.\nAKINS: I’m doing my job. Now come on, ‘Doctor’.\nACE: Aow!\nDOVEDAY: Get off her! (STRUGGLING WITH AKINS) I won’t stand by and watch you ill-treat a —\nAKINS: Get offa me, you nut!\nDOVEDAY: (FX: THROWN TO FLOOR.)

(FX: A SHARPER ROAR FROM THE SAME DISTANCE.) It rather sounds as if they might have woken up!\nWHYTECRAG: They are awake.\nCORBIN: Do you realise what that means, Whytecrag? I do. Oh, one can read Doveday’s words upside down and inside out and it still can’t prepare you for.. No. No. I shan’t face it again. I can’t! Hex, come with me. We’re going back!\nWHYTECRAG: Calm down.\nSLADE: Should I shoot one of them, sir? To encourage the other, maybe?\nWHYTECRAG: Don’t tempt me, Mr Slade.\nCORBIN: This is what it comes down to, eh, Whytecrag? Our grand talk of communication with the secret forces of the Universe? Threats from hired bully boys?\nSLADE: Hired soldier, if you don’t mind!\nHEX: Bloody-minded mercenary, in other words.\nSLADE: Oh, I know all about blood, son. I fought a war when I was younger than you.\nHEX: Maybe I’ve been around more than you think.\nDOCTOR WHO: LURKERS AT SUNLIGHT’S EDGE by Marty Ross (FINAL) Page 51\nSLADE: Maybe I ought to take the butt of this rifle and knock some respect into you!\nWHY TECRAG: Gentlemen, you can dig trenches and fight it out later.

Maybe you should check in here for a month or two. — (ALOUD) Why don’t a couple\nFREYA: of you fellows help the Doctor to a seat and a glass of water?\nDOCTOR: No, honestly, I think I’d better... better reunite myself with my companion.\nFREYA: Whoops!

Of course, there is an armed guard outside, just to make me feel doubly secure.\nDOCTOR: Invite him in. If you’re too grand to scratch my nose, maybe he will.\nFREYA: Rub it against the wall. The padding’s nice and soft.\nDOCTOR: I noticed. I’ve bounced around it a few times. Just for the exercise, you understand.\nFREYA: Don’t take it personally. As one of the more brilliant psychiatrists of my generation, I’m fully convinced you’re not insane.\nDOCTOR: I wish I could say the same of your dainty little institution.\nFREYA: Our institution may not be quite the institution you take it to be. Just as I doubt you’re any kind of doctor.\nDOCTOR: Oh, I’m a Doctor alright.

Calmed who down?\nCORBIN: A very dangerous man. Almost as dangerous as me.\nHEX: What makes you so dangerous?\nCORBIN: I thought — I hoped — if I served Whytecrag’s lust for power, I might be rewarded with a little power of my own. Now here I huddle, with all the power of a mouse trapped in a wainscot, a housecat one end of the hole, a nest of panthers at the other. (DESPAIR) Oh, what’s the point-?\nHEX: Survival.\nCORBIN: It’s too late for that. Much too late.\nHEX: It’s never too late. Listen — not so long ago, I saw one of those friends of mine come back from the dead. The actual dead!\nCORBIN: They’re dead now. Your friends.\nHEX: I dunno. Maybe. Maybe him with the scythe was making a point. Death won’t be cheated, you know? (BEAT) But still — with the Doctor, you can’t ever be sure. That’s why I’m surviving, Prof. Whatever it takes, I’m surviving!\nDOCTOR WHO: LURKERS AT SUNLIGHT’S EDGE by Marty Ross (FINAL) Page 73\nCORBIN: There is.. one thing we might do. Or attempt to do.\nHEX: Which is?\nCORBIN: Whytecrag is here to perform certain... rituals. Rituals he believes will give him absolute power over the world.\nHEX: So?\nCORBIN: We could catch up with him, prevent him doing what he’s here to do.\nHEX: Well, let’s do that, then.\nCORBIN: And if the only way is to kill him? Could you do that?\nHEX: Despite everything? Mate, that’s a big ask. Sorry.\nCORBIN: You’re an honourable young fellow. I, on the other hand, am already damned.

About the crystal key being for the earthly door, the golden for the galaxy’s heart. No, the galaxy’s heart and the ocean’s bed.
