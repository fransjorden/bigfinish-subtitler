The outside entrance is below the ice now, and the tunnel access here is blocked by something.\nVERONICA: We need to get in there.\nROGER: We will. You’ll see. It’s going to be tremendous, Veronica.

Ah, there you are, Flip.\nTOASTY: Are you okay?\nDOCTOR: Fine, fine, yes. Probably no more than a 30-degree drop. I’ve been colder, I can tell you.\nTOASTY: I meant her. (TO FLIP) Here. Take my coat.\nFLIP: (PUTTING ON COAT) Coat, coat, coat — oh. It’s heated! I love this coat. I will never take it off. Have you got two? What about heated trousers?\nTOASTY: It’s not that cold, you know.\nDOCTOR: Minus fifteen Celsius, I should say. Interesting building. I didn’t know there were buildings away from the city.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 5\nFLIP: One second ago I was in Nerva City, where the weather is twenty degrees. He says, “Stand over there, out of the way,” and there turns out to be a transmat to here, the icy ice caves of Iceland.\nDOCTOR: I think it’s more likely Scotland. Though in this period, that is out of the way.\nTOASTY: It is Scotland. You’re on Inchfad Isle on Loch Lomond.\nFLIP: Sure it’s lovely. In the summer.\nDOCTOR: Come now, Flip. I told you it was a transmat.\nFLIP: You said it was a phone booth.\nDOCTOR: Nonsense. Anyway, the two are often confused.\nFLIP: I bet they admit it when they are.\nTOASTY: You two sound like my Mum and Dad.\nDOCTOR: Is that a compliment?\nFLIP: Didn’t sound it to me. (TO TOASTY) Sorry, hello. Didn’t mean to drop in like this. Complete accident. Happens to him all the time. You sure you’re okay without your coat?\nTOASTY: Oh, yes. Dad says I have hot blood. That’s why he calls me Toasty.\nDOCTOR: Unusual name.\nFLIP: Yeah, “Doctor”. Hello, Toasty, I’m Flip.

They’re not the Nerva City Crew.\nDOCTOR: I’ll have you know we’re not anyone’s crew.\nFLIP: Sounds like a bad Eighties band anyway.\nTOASTY: Dad, it’s fine. This is Flip and the Doctor.\nFLIP: Do you know, that sounds like a bad Nineties band?\nDOCTOR: And you'll find we’re charming company. When you’re not pointing guns at us, that is.\nFLIP: Look, we’re really sorry. Completely didn’t mean to come, I just stood on a transmat without knowing it. And when I can feel my legs again, we’ll be right off. Won’t we, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Hmm? Oh, I shouldn’t think so. Far too much to find out. Such as why any of you are here at all. Is this a house?\nFLIP: Doctor, it’s not nice to comment on people’s homes.\nVERONICA: It’s alright. Flip, is it? I’m Veronica Buchman and he’s saying no worse than I have.\nFLIP: Hello, Veronica. (TO ROGER) And you are?\nROGER: Roger Buchman.\nTOASTY: My Dad!\nVERONICA: That’ll do, Toasty. Go get one of the heaters, see if we can get it working.\nROGER: They’re by the storage areas.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 7\nVERONICA: Call us if they’re too heavy.\nDOCTOR: I take it you’re an engineer, Roger?\nROGER: First Engineer.\nDOCTOR: Uniforms haven’t changed much. (TO VERONICA) Which makes you a Technician, hmm?\nVERONICA: I was, yes.\nFLIP: (TO DOCTOR) How do you know?\nDOCTOR: (ASIDE) At this point they’re still using breeding programs, rigid controls over mating, the gene pool. They call it pair bonding.\nVERONICA: Means our hearing is first class, for one thing.\nDOCTOR: Very good.\nFLIP: He means sorry.\nDOCTOR: He means: can you put the guns away now?\nTOASTY: (DISTORT, OVER RADIO) Dad, there’s no power, I can’t see.\nFLIP: (ASIDE) Wow, that’s a proper brick of a phone. What is it, 80s retro?\nDOCTOR: (ASIDE) Radio-phone. No satellites, not any more. Radiation.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 8\nROGER: (INTO RADIO) Just inside the door, Toasty. Feel for a metal canister, that’s what we want.\nTOASTY: (D) Got it, Dad.\nDOCTOR: Now we’re all friends, could I trouble you for a hot drink? Could you take my friend here to a kitchen?\nVERONICA: Yes, of course. Need to warm you up from the inside too.\nDOCTOR: Go with Veronica, Flip.\nFLIP: You’re really sending me to the kitchen?\nDOCTOR: What’s usually the warmest room in a house, hmm? Go. If Veronica’s taking you, I’m going to take our engineer Roger for a little walk.\nROGER: I have more important things to do than talk to you.\nDOCTOR: You only think so. (WALKS) Come along. —\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 9\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 4. EXT. BUCHMAN HOUSE.\nDOCTOR: (STEPPING OUT) Ah, Loch Lomond! Mind you, mid-hundred-and- sixty-second Century, it’s a long time since I was here.\nROGER: I don’t believe that. Nobody’s been here.\nDOCTOR: Before you were born, Roger. Or was it after? I can tell you that I don’t remember it being an ice rink.\nROGER: The loch froze over from top to bottom, fifteen years back. One of the weather changes that made them recall us.\nDOCTOR: Weather?\nROGER: You really don’t know anything, do you?\nDOCTOR: Just travelling through —\nROGER: Sure. What traveller could be expected to know the year? It’s all right. I know.\nDOCTOR: You do?\nROGER: (GOING INTO HIMSELF) It’s sixteen-one-twenty-seven. Barely forty years since we returned to Earth and already we’ve lost so much. Genetic matching used to work, but the population resources are scarce, we’re having to do more with less. A little contamination from the GalSec lot and it all breaks down. The result is people like you.\nDOCTOR: I very much doubt it.\nROGER: Not your fault. You need help, I understand. They just shouldn’t pretend you can cope in society. You need your own faculty.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 10\nDOCTOR: I have all of my faculties, thank you. And one of them tells me it wasn’t weather that drove you back, it was more likely nuclear winds.\nROGER: Take your pick. It was just stupid to order us back. Colonies were starting to bed in, some were beginning to flourish.\nDOCTOR: I don’t think you’d have done much flourishing here.\nROGER: We have to rebuild. We can’t stay in Nerva City, we have to reclaim the Earth and its resources. So we come back here and we start again.\nDOCTOR: Unless you’re planning to export ice cubes, I don’t see any resources here that you can even get to.\nROGER: That’s where you’re wrong. The loch’s starting to melt again, we can get that going, reseed it with fish from other colonies.\nDOCTOR: That loch is a long way from melting. Unless you focus the transmat onto the loch.\nROGER: Sorry?\nDOCTOR: Suddenly he’s interested. Let’s go back inside. I’m a lot older than I look and the cold’s even getting to me.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 11\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 5. INT. BUCHMAN KITCHEN.\nTOASTY: (ENTERING) Where’s Dad? I’ve got the heater.\nVERONICA: Bring it in here by the stove.\nFLIP: Can I help with anything?\nVERONICA: There’s a bag of ration packs right behind you. Get me a couple of oh-twos.\nFLIP: Which ones are they?\nVERONICA: Orange ones. How do you not know this stuff? Basic survival colour.\nFLIP: I’m new to the whole survival thing.\nFLIP: Oh, I can feel that warming up the place already. Weird how fast you focus on heat when you haven’t got any.\nVERONICA: Cold houses are depressing places. Really get to you.\nTOASTY: It’s at full now. Shall I get another one?\nVERONICA: Not yet. Need to save them. Ask your father where he’s working next.\nTOASTY: Okay.\nVERONICA: Toasty’s twenty next month. She should be enjoying the Olympic\nVERONICA: ceremony in Nerva City, not stuck out here with us.\nFLIP: She seems really nice.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 12\nVERONICA: Do her good to have some of your attitude.\nFLIP: I don’t follow.\nVERONICA: I’m not saying you’re a bad daughter, don’t get me wrong, but you don’t take any of his nonsense. And he clearly respects you for it.\nFLIP: Oh, right. The Doctor’s not my father.\nVERONICA: Oh. I see. Well, anyway, it’s late, we must all be hungry. Help me with the porridge.\nFLIP: Porridge! I love porridge. Now that says Scotland to me. (BEAT) Er.. Where is it?\nVERONICA: Careful! You’re standing in it, pretty much.\nFLIP: (REALISATION) Eurgh!\nVERONICA: It’s just a spill. The crew knocked over what they’d gathered, I think.\nFLIP: Gathered? You don’t gather porridge. (FX: TACKY STRAND OF SLIME IN FINGERS, LIKE SWARFEGA) Yeah, and while we’re about it, it’s not supposed to be sticky and green!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 13\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 6. INT. BUCHMAN TRANSMAT ROOM.\nDOCTOR: Hard to believe you people can make a transmat pad this slim already.\nROGER: This part, Doctor, this is just the transmat receiver. The lens pad itself. The transmat engines are in the outhouse.\nDOCTOR: Which is where the refractors and the diode receptors will be.\nROGER: Hardly. That’s old technology. I think we’ve moved on a bit Since then.\nTOASTY: Dad —\nROGER: (TO DOCTOR) No wonder you think you can transmat a loch. Should you really be allowed out?\nDOCTOR: Think, man. Matter transmitters! The most precision device mankind has ever and will ever make. Built to lock on to the very hadrons and quarks and pinstripes in molecules and transport them away. So you just use the transmat to fasten onto the water molecules in the loch and give them a bit of a shake. Like a microwave oven.\nTOASTY: That’s really clever.\nDOCTOR: Of course it is. I thought of it.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 14\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 7. INT. BUCHMAN KITCHEN. EARLY EVENING\nVERONICA: ‘Forage porridge’, we called it. We found it growing on the forest floor, all those years ago. It’s really very nutritious.\nFLIP: Yeah, proper organic. What is it exactly?\nVERONICA: We’re not quite sure. Roger said a fungus. There’s lots that’s missing from the Nerva records. Neither flora nor fauna, you see.\nFLIP: So who was it spilled your porridge? Don’t tell me Goldilocks.\nVERONICA: Who’s-? [Goldilocks]\nFLIP: Er.. never mind. The Crew, you said. Something about a Nerva City Crew?\nVERONICA: An advance party gets sent out to each new colony — you know, to secure the area, get the hot water running, that sort of thing. They’re supposed to stick around, to help out for the first few days. Not just make a mess and vanish.\nVERONICA: Right, water’s ready.\nDOCTOR: Ah, Flip, fully recovered?\nFLIP: Yeah. Cheers. Come in, Veronica’s about to dish up her special porridge.\nTOASTY: Dad wants to eat now.\nVERONICA: Then it’s just as well we’re ready. Roger, we need some more oh-two packs.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 15\nROGER: We need to conserve them, Veronica.\nVERONICA: We won’t always have visitors. And Sheer will bring more.\nFLIP: Sheer?\nFLIP: [VERONICA DISHES UP THE ’PORRIDGE’; WOODEN BOWLS AND CUTLERY ]\nVERONICA: He’s joining us after his tour on the space station.\nTOASTY: I like Sheer.\nROGER: (SOUR) Who doesn’t?\nVERONICA: Roger, you sit there. (FX: EVERYONE TAKING SEATS) Toasty too. Flip, come by me. And Flip’s.. “friend”.. take a seat.\nDOCTOR: (SITTING) Thank you. (BEAT) This is porridge-?!?\nFLIP: Forage porridge.\nROGER: It’s a kind of joke.\nDOCTOR: I take it you didn’t bring it with you from Nerva City, then?\nFLIP: They find it on the forest floor.\nTOASTY: All my life they’ve been going on about it. Forage porridge. (ABOUT TO TUCK IN) It’s supposed to be delicious — (STOPPED BY\nTOASTY: DOCTOR) Hey!\nDOCTOR: I wouldn’t tuck in just yet if I were you, young lady.\nFLIP: Oh! We supposed to say Grace, or something?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 16\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid this... substance you call ‘forage porridge’, isn’t food.\nROGER: Nonsense, it’s perfectly good and natural. Eat up, Toasty.\nDOCTOR: I’m serious. This isn’t food. It’s mucus.\nFLIP: Mucus.\nDOCTOR: If I’m not mistaken, and I so rarely am these days, it’s Wirrn mucus.\nTOASTY: What’s Wirrn?\nFLIP: Yeah, he said mucus?\nVERONICA: Doctor, you’re worrying Toasty.\nROGER: It’s not very polite, transmatting in and trying to frighten us.\nTOASTY: What’s Wirrn?\nFLIP: Again, he said mucus. —\nVERONICA: They haven’t been seen in decades. They were like giant insects, I suppose —\nDOCTOR: Adult Wirrn are like insects, yes. But they start out as pupae, and as pupae, they leave slime trails.\nFLIP: (FX: PUSHING BOWL AWAY) Mucus.\nDOCTOR: This is fresh. You said there should have been a party here before you?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 17\nVERONICA: A Nerva City Crew. Just a pair of multi-skills.\nFLIP: Trail. Slime trail. You said the crew must have spilled that stuff, but when we got here, there was like a massive streak of it, all along the floor?\nDOCTOR: Show me where it led.\nFLIP: Well — all under the table, all the way to the pantry door.\nDOCTOR: (WALKING OVER) This pantry door?\nFLIP: Uh, yeah. —\nDOCTOR: And you didn’t open it?\nFLIP: No.\nROGER: Leave that alone. I don’t know about any ‘pantry’, there’s a junction box in there.\nDOCTOR: (TOUCHING DOOR) Warm. Toasty, in fact. The first place they’d\nDOCTOR: go.\nFLIP: (NERVOUS) Doctor, don’t —\nDOCTOR: It’s quite all right, I know what I’m doing. —\nDOCTOR: TOASTY/FLIP:\nFLIP: Oh, my God.\nVERONICA: Toasty, don’t look.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 18\nTOASTY: What are they?\nDOCTOR: What’s left of two multi-skills, I presume. Husks. Abandoned once they’d been eaten.\nFLIP: Those were really people?\nVERONICA: That’s it. Everybody, we’re leaving.\nROGER: You've been looking for an excuse, Veronica, and —\nVERONICA: And now I’ve found one, yes!\nROGER: Anything to split the family up. We’re staying.\nDOCTOR: I strongly recommend you leave.\nFLIP: Wouldn’t catch me staying where something does that to people.\nVERONICA: Roger. Focus on this. I came here to keep the family together. But it’s just a little hard to keep us together if we’re going to die.\nDOCTOR: You too, Flip. You’re going back to the TARDIS.\nFLIP: Oh, it’s fine, not getting rid of me.\nTOASTY: [LIKES IT] You’re very cheeky to your Dad!\nFLIP: He’s not my Dad!\nVERONICA: Transmat, right now. Including you, Roger. And you, Doctor.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 19\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 8. INT. BUCHMAN TRANSMAT ROOM. AFTERNOON\nVERONICA: Everybody onto the pad.\nFLIP: Come on Toasty, stand with me.\nROGER: All these years working to get back and we’re just running away.\nDOCTOR: Hmm. Rather crude timer on this transmat.\nROGER: I designed that.\nDOCTOR: Never mind, I’m sure you did your best. Everybody on? And ...\nDOCTOR: . here we go.\nDOCTOR: Bunch up then, give me some room.\nVERONICA: Goodbye Loch Lomond.\nVERONICA: (F/X COUNTDOWN CLIMAXES — - AND NOTHING HAPPENS. BEAT. )\nROGER: Thought you were the great transmat expert, Doctor.\nVERONICA: Boys! Just get it fixed.\nDOCTOR: Let’s think. We know the power’s working.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 20\nROGER: And the co-ordinates are a straight reverse to Nerva City, the fault can’t be there.\nROGER: Something’s coming through. Everybody, off the pad.\nDOCTOR: Roger, quickly. Transmats used to need pads or spheres at both ends: is that still true?\nROGER: No, not for years. I designed pad-to-site systems a decade ago.\nROGER: Why?\nDOCTOR: Hopefully academic interest. Here we go.\nVERONICA: It could be Sheer, coming early from the space station.\nFLIP: I hope he’s wearing a warm spacesuit, then.\nTOASTY: (CONFIDENTIALLY) I like him in those, too.\nFLIP: I get it. Not so much warm as hot, right?\nFLIP: (F/X THE TRANSMAT HUM COMPLETES. BEAT)\nDOCTOR: So, not Sheer, then.\nFLIP: What is it?\nROGER: It’s a video beacon.\nROGER: (F/X A LISTEN-UP CHIME. THE BEACON PLAYS A RECORDED MESSAGE FROM PAUL, A BUREAUCRAT. )\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 21\nPAUL: (RECORDED) Hear me, citizens of Nerva City.\nROGER: It’s Paul.\nPAUL: (RECORDED) Pioneers of Nerva City and our new Earth.\nVERONICA: [TO FLIP] Head of the colony program.\nPAUL: (RECORDED) As Nerva City strains to provide shelter and food to our population, it is to you we look for the future of mankind. Each of you, in your new homes, your new colonies, what you do every day secures a brighter future for us all. For your benefit, Nerva City Colony Board has reluctantly made transmats one-way only. Know that it was a difficult but a necessary decision. And when this message ends, extra supplies will be beamed to your pad. I thank you for the sacrifices I know you will continue to make on our behalf.\nDOCTOR: Not the best news I’ve ever had.\nROGER: I was on the board! How can they do this?\nVERONICA: To get rid of you.\nTOASTY: Mum!\nFLIP: That’s quite a lot of supplies they’ve beamed in. Not to sound violent, but is there any chance they included more guns?\nDOCTOR: Doesn’t matter. Wirrn survive just about anything you can think of. The vacuum of space. Everything but electricity.\nFLIP: Lovely.\nDOCTOR: Veronica, Roger. Can you call this Nerva Board?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 22\nROGER: No.\nVERONICA: We've only got our radio-phones.\nROGER: Short-range comms.\nFLIP: Wait, how were the Nerva City Crew supposed to move on to their next job?\nDOCTOR: Encoded pass IDs, probably.\nFLIP: So why don’t we find those?\nDOCTOR: Though there was nothing like that by the husks.\nROGER: Because it’s a molecular-level code, Doctor. The transmat would analyze their DNA and let them through. We’1ll have to rewire the transmat engines.\nTOASTY: They’re in the outhouse.\nVERONICA: And it’s impossible to get in there.\nROGER: Not impossible.\nDOCTOR: But not practical, I see. Any other colonies? Anything in range of your radio-phones?\nROGER: We’re the northernmost colony.\nVERONICA: There’1l be a transmat substation over at Aldochlay. It was going to be to the router for Europe. It’s got to be less than four kilometres away.\nROGER: The island’s got a boat channel, maybe there’s still something seaworthy.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 23\nVERONICA: Nothing could sail that loch.\nDOCTOR: Then either we find a way into the outhouse or we walk over the ice to Aldochlay. Normally I’d enjoy a good stretch of the legs, but —\nFLIP: But until we know where the Wirrn is, we could be walking into trouble.\nROGER: Two Wirrn? Maybe three if it was a big crew.\nDOCTOR: The eggs didn’t come from thin air. We have to assume there’s a swarm. And if it’s not in your house, there aren’t many places it can be.\nVERONICA: We'd just need one person to get across the loch and work the\nVERONICA: transmat for the rest of us, wouldn’t we?\nROGER: So now you’re willing to split up.\nVERONICA: I’m thinking of the microlite.\nROGER: Oh.\nTOASTY: You mean my brother’s microlite.\nTOASTY: Before he died.\nROGER: How long have you known?\nTOASTY: Since military recruiters came to school. They said soldiers have regular visits home.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 24\nVERONICA: I’m sorry, Toasty, —\nTOASTY: And I heard you arguing about him.\nFLIP: Brothers are always trouble.\nTOASTY: (TO FLIP) So are parents. (TO ROGER AND VERONICA) It’s okay. I’ve had years to get used to it. Found his diary in storage too. So I know about the microlite and that he loved to fly.\nVERONICA: He did. He used to fly over the loch.\nTOASTY: So shall we get it?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 25\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 9. INT. BUCHMAN HOUSE. SUPPLY ROOM EVENING\nTOASTY: There’s still no light in here.\nVERONICA: I found a torch in the kitchen.\nVERONICA: (F/X SHE SWITCHES IT ON — - AND WITH A SQUEAL, RATS RUN AWAY)\nDOCTOR: So where’s this microlite?\nVERONICA: It’s back here.\nDOCTOR: And where’s the rest of it?\nVERONICA: It is smaller than I remember.\nTOASTY: Can I fly it?\nROGER: No. Too dangerous.\nDOCTOR: We might not have a choice. That frame won’t support anyone else. And that’s if the engine still works.\nROGER: You were saying, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Yes, I was.\nFLIP: How far did you say it is?\nROGER: [DEMONSTRATING] It’s fine. You just start it here, wait for it to catch, then pull out the choke. Not too long. Pop it back in, engine’s fine.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 26\nFLIP: You’re sure?\nROGER: Totally. Might get the odd flutter but just give it choke for another second and you’1ll be fine.\nFLIP: Okay, I will.\nDOCTOR: You will what?\nFLIP: Come on, Doctor. I’m the lightest one here... not boasting or anything.\nTOASTY: I’m lighter.\nROGER: (TO TOASTY) You stay right where you are.\nFLIP: See? It’s me or it’s nobody. I mean... how hard can it be? So, which way’s Aldochlay?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 27\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 10. EXT. BUCHMAN HOUSE. EVENING\nDOCTOR WHO: (EVERYBODY OUT, CARRYING THE MICROLITE. IT’S EVEN WINDIER. THE MICROLITE’S FABRIC FLAPS, THE ENGINE IS HEAVY AND THE METAL FRAME SCRAPES AGAINST THE DOOR)\nTOASTY: Watch the door.\nDOCTOR: I’m glad to say, the metal frame looks more solid than I thought.\nFLIP: And the engine’s heavy enough.\nDOCTOR: Flip, you don’t have to—\nFLIP: Do this? I think we both know I do. And besides, Roger’s given me a crash course... er.\nDOCTOR: Yes, not a happy choice of words.\nFLIP: And anyway, this is kind of why I came with you, Doctor. To do exciting things. No point just sitting around freezing when—\nDOCTOR: You can be up there freezing. Flip, I can’t make up my mind on whether you’re one of the bravest girls I’ve met... or simply foolhardy.\nFLIP: I’ll keep you guessing, then, shall I?\nROGER: Here we go.\nVERONICA: Flip, are you sure?\nDOCTOR: This isn’t exactly ideal flying weather, is it now?\nFLIP: You want to wait?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 28\nDOCTOR: No. No, I see your point. If the Wirrn aren’t in the house, they’re presumably out here somewhere. Pupae can move quite fast, but it’s a big loch.\nFLIP: So let’s go. How will I recognise the substation?\nROGER: Once you clear Inchfad, you fly over Inchconnachan Isle and then Aldochlay is the next land. There’s just one building on the coast.\nFLIP: So I can’t miss it. And I can land there?\nROGER: There was a strip near it. Remember what I said... take her down nice and steady and then throttle back.\nFLIP: Right’.\nDOCTOR: We’1ll talk you through the transmat controls when you get there.\nFLIP: Good, one less thing to worry about. Can we fasten the wing fabric with anything? That’s one more thing to worry about.\nTOASTY: I’d like to go, Flip.\nFLIP: I know, Toasty. Call it a thanks for your coat.\nDOCTOR: Speaking of which...\nFLIP: Yes, I guessed that. Too heavy. Okay.\nFLIP: Remind me of this next time we’re anywhere warm. Here you go.\nFLIP: I’m going to want that right back, though.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 29\nROGER: We’re ready.\nVERONICA: Thank you, Flip.\nDOCTOR: Be careful now.\nFLIP: (SITTING INTO THE MICROLITE) I will, don’t you — oooooh, aah, the metal’s freezing already. Just four kilometres, you promise?\nVERONICA: Take a radio-phone.\nROGER: Hey, that’s mine, I —\nVERONICA: That’s the thing to worry about, Roger, your phone.\nFLIP: I used to be the same. Always upgrading. Any chance this has got a GPS app on it?\nDOCTOR: Flip. See that gap in the clouds? Once you’re airborne, turn right around and aim for that. And try to get there while there’s any light left.\nFLIP: I know. Choke.\nFLIP: You’d better all stand clear.\nTOASTY: Good luck.\nVERONICA: Keep your radio on, okay?\nDOCTOR: (QUIETLY) Flip? I’m still not sure you understand how dangerous this 2S.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 30\nFLIP: I’ve already died once, what can be worse? Now, if I don’t get\nFLIP: going, I’ll be shivering too much to steer straight.\nDOCTOR: Flip, if I could fly this —\nFLIP: I'll be careful.\nDOCTOR: Remember, if you can’t see the strip or it’s blocked in any\nDOCTOR: way, land on the loch: it’s smooth, uninterrupted ice.\nFLIP: Okay, Doctor. Aldochlay or bust.\nFLIP: (F/X ONE MORE GUN OF THE ENGINE AND SHE’S OFF: DURING THE FOLLOWING SHE’LL RATTLE ACROSS THE ICY ISLAND AND THEN UP THE AIR.)\nDOCTOR: (TO HIMSELF) Remarkable girl.\nROGER: I’ll go get the transmat ready.\nTOASTY: (RE FLIP) Look at her go! She must be having so much fun!\nDOCTOR: I do hope so.\nVERONICA: Last time I saw my boy he was flying that.\nVERONICA: INTO\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 31\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 11. EXT. LOCH LOMOND AIRSPACE — EVENING (F/X ENGINE IN FLIGHT — - UNTIL IT STUTTERS)\nFLIP: Oh, no you don’t.\nDOCTOR: (OVER RADIO) Flip! Turn around!\nFLIP: Choke, choke, come on.\nDOCTOR: (OVER RADIO) Flip!\nFLIP: (INTO RADIO) Okay, Doctor. Bit hard to talk and wring this engine’s neck at the same time.\nDOCTOR: (OVER RADIO) That’s not why it’s called choke.\nFLIP: (INTO RADIO) Works for me. Okay, this isn’t too bad, I can do this. If my fingers don’t freeze off.\nFLIP: (INTO RADIO) I can see you! Everybody, give me a wave then. [BEAT] Thank you, Toasty! Right, I’ve got that cloud gap, I’m\nFLIP: heading towards it.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 32\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 12. EXT. BUCHMAN HOUSE. EVENING\nDOCTOR: (INTO RADIO) FLIP! CHOKE!\nDOCTOR: (F/X THE ENGINE NOISE IS DISTANT OVER THE WIND BUT IT’S THERE AND SPRINGS BACK INTO LIFE)\nDOCTOR: (INTO RADIO) Good work!\nFLIP: (OVER RADIO) I’m having to leave the choke open and watch the\nFLIP: petrol gauge. Now I understand what Jared kept saying about his bike.\nDOCTOR: (INTO RADIO) Can you fly any higher?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 33\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 13. EXT. LOCH LOMOND AIRSPACE. EVENING\nFLIP: (INTO RADIO) Hang on.\nFLIP: (INTO RADIO) Yes, Doctor. Flying higher is no problem at all. It’s the turning bit that kills the motor. Good thing I’m pointing the right way now.\nFLIP: (TO HERSELF) I could get to like this.\nFLIP: I wish I had some thermal underwear on, though.\nFLIP: (LONG, LONG BEAT. THEN FLIP’S RADIO SQUAWKS FOR A SECOND)\nFLIP: (INTO RADIO) Doctor? Did you say something?\nDOCTOR: (OVER RADIO) Pardon? No... not me. How far have you got?\nFLIP: (INTO RADIO) I don’t know how to tell.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 34\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 14: EXT. BUCHMAN HOUSE\nDOCTOR: (INTO RADIO) Estimate your airspeed and multiply by the flight time. It’s perfectly simple.\nFLIP: (OVER RADIO) Oh yeah, obviously. Why didn’t I think of that?\nTOASTY: She’s great, isn’t she?\nDOCTOR: She’s a worry.\nFLIP: (OVER RADIO) You’re breaking up, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: (INTO RADIO) I haven’t said anything.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 35\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 15. EXT. LOCH LOMOND AIRSPACE\nFLIP: (INTO RADIO) My radio-phone squawked.\nFLIP: (INTO RADIO) Like that.\nDOCTOR: (OVER RADIO) Signal’s clear here. You should be passing over the next island by now.\nFLIP: (INTO RADIO) Done that. I’m over ice again.\nFLIP: (INTO RADIO) Doctor, there are... er.. branches on the ice.\nDOCTOR: (OVER RADIO) Branches?\nFLIP: (INTO RADIO) I think they’re branches. Now they look more like little veins. Some under the ice, some on it. Oh. Doctor. That’s freaky. I think the ones poking out are moving. I’m sure they’re moving. I’d swear they were trying to reach up to me.\nFLIP: No, no, choke! CHOKE!\nFLIP: (F/X THE ENGINE SPLUTTERS EXACTLY ONCE AND IS DEAD FOREVER. THE MICROLITE STARTS TO DROP)\nDOCTOR: (OVER RADIO) Flip?!?\nFLIP: (INTO RADIO) It’s no good, Doctor. I’m going down. Gonna try turning into the wind, glide it, like Roger said, and —\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 36\nFLIP: Oh, God. Who told me to fly higher?\nFLIP: WHOA!

Come on — WHOA! Doctor, I’m spinning, I’m — aaaaaaaaaaa! (CRIES OUT, FALLING)\nFLIP: SCENE 17. EXT. BUCHMAN HOUSE. EVENING\nDOCTOR: (INTO RADIO) Flip? Can you hear me? Flip!!!\nDOCTOR: I don’t suppose her radio battery could’ve failed.\nVERONICA: I’m sorry, Doctor. Radio-phone batteries last decades. If she’s not answering, it’s because she can’t.\nDOCTOR: Decades? Well — they look rugged, there’s a good chance they’d survive a crash.\nVERONICA: Almost certainly.\nDOCTOR: So we can track its transmitter, and that’1ll lead us straight to her. I just need a tool-kit so we can adjust—\nVERONICA: We’ve nothing like that.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 38\nDOCTOR: Then we’ll improvise. And we have our own medtech, of course, don’t we — Roger? Where’s Roger?\nTOASTY: I’1l get him.\nVERONICA: You get Roger, I'll get the survival unit. We’re not going to lose Flip on the loch, Doctor.

I repeat —\nTOASTY: (APPROACHING, FROM OFF) Dad-?\nTOASTY: Dad, Flip’s crashed on the ice.\nROGER: Has she.\nDOCTOR: Yes, and she may be very badly injured.\nVERONICA: Roger, we need you.\nROGER: We?\nVERONICA: You don’t think I can leave anyone else to die on the loch, do you?\nDOCTOR: Anyone else? What do you— ?\nROGER: (TO VERONICA) So that’s how it is now. You and your Doctor. Instead of you and your engineer. Always the science types.\nTOASTY: Oh, please! Stop fighting! These days, you’re always fighting!\nROGER: That will end soon, I promise.\nVERONICA: Yes, it will. I’1l get the survival kit.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 41\nDOCTOR: I’m going to try Flip again.\nTOASTY: Let me.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 42\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 20.

We can build one on the spot.\nTOASTY: Then let’s go.\nROGER: Not you. You’re staying with me, Toasty. That’s an end to it.\nVERONICA: We all stick together.\nROGER: You go, I’m not stopping you. But I need Toasty right here.\nTOASTY: You do?\nROGER: I can’t do this without you.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 44\nVERONICA: Oh, great, play the Dad card.\nROGER: I’ve got to concentrate. Go if you’re going.\nDOCTOR: Roger, what are you actually doing?\nROGER: So much for our friendly transmat expert. We can’t transmat out, Doctor, you’ve seen what happens when we try. But people can still beam in. I’m trying to get the transmat to scan across the loch, fasten on to your friend.\nROGER: (F/X UNDER THE FOLLOWING, THERE’S A THUMP THUMP THUMP FROM THE RADIO)\nDOCTOR: When you’re so sure she’s dead?\nROGER: And there you were thinking I was the bad guy.\nDOCTOR: Move over.

NIGHT\nDOCTOR: (D) Flip? Are you hurt? We need to know.\nFLIP: (INTO RADIO) Doctor! Okay. But it’1l sound worse than it is.\nDOCTOR: (D) Whatever it is, we’ll get you sorted out.\nFLIP: Pretty sure I’ve broken a couple of ribs. Oh! And there’s blood — frozen on the ice. How long was I out?\nDOCTOR: (D) Not long at all. Keep talking.\nFLIP: Seriously? And you’1ll listen?\nDOCTOR: (D) We’re working out a rescue right now. Tell me about the blood.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 46\nFLIP: Doesn’t feel like I’m bleeding. I’m going to turn over, see if I can see where it’s come from.\nDOCTOR: (D) Flip? You’re on the ice?\nFLIP: Think I’m nearly at Aldochlay.\nDOCTOR: (D) No, I mean, you’re lying on the ice? You must get up now. Get on your feet. Don’t lie down.\nFLIP: Right, I’m — OH! OW! OH! (HUGE GULPING BREATH)\nFLIP: SCENE 25. INT. BUCHMAN TRANSMAT. NIGHT\nDOCTOR: (INTO RADIO) Flip?\nFLIP: (D) Doctor — my cheek’s frozen to the ice.\nDOCTOR: Roger?\nROGER: This temperature, direct skin contact on ice, she’s got minutes.\nDOCTOR: And that’s if the Wirrn don’t get to her first. (INTO RADIO) Flip, chip at the ice.\nFLIP: (D) (FX: CHIPPING AT ICE WITH RADIO-PHONE) Trying. Radio- phone’s no good, doesn’t make a dent.\nDOCTOR: Can you reach the microlite? The metal frame?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 47\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 26. EXT. LOCH LOMOND. NIGHT\nFLIP: (INTO RADIO) Right. It’s somewhere behind me. I know it’s near, I can touch it with my foot but I can’t turn to look. But, wait, Doctor, there’s a branch right in front of me. About an inch out of reach now but it’s moving in the wind, I’ve nearly got it.\nDOCTOR: (D) A branch? On the loch?\nFLIP: I know. Weird — it’s stuck in the ice at one end.\nFLIP: SCENE 27. INT. BUCHMAN TRANSMAT ROOM\nTOASTY: Could be loose, a tree that broke off in the cold.\nVERONICA: It'd be too brittle, it’d break at a touch.\nDOCTOR: I’m very much afraid it’s worse than that. (INTO RADIO) Flip, it’s not a branch. I’1l1 explain later, just leave it for now. Concentrate on the microlite. I’11 call you back in a moment. Doctor out.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 48\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 28. EXT. LOCH LOMOND. NIGHT\nFLIP: (INTO RADIO) I think I can just reach it.\nFLIP: (FLIP STRAINING TO REACH THE MICROLITE FRAME. BREATHING AWKWARDLY.\nFLIP: BEAT. RADIO SQUAWK. )\nFLIP: (INTO RADIO) Doctor?\nFLIP: IRON/WIRRN: (D) Don’t worry, I’m coming.\nFLIP: (INTO RADIO) Hello? Who are you? (BEAT) Please, if you’re near, I could use some help. (BEAT) At least listen. You’re in danger too. There are Wirrn on the loch.\nFLIP: IRON/WIRRN:\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 49\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 29. INT. BUCHMAN TRANSMAT. NIGHT\nDOCTOR: Roger, she’s alive. You should be able to transmat her back here.\nVERONICA: And separate her from the ice too?\nROGER: No.\nDOCTOR: Well, get her back here with a chunk of the ice then.\nROGER: I mean, no, it can’t be done. Unless she’s standing on a lens pad, our pad here has to reach out and scan for her DNA.\nDOCTOR: She’s alone on the ice, there won’t be anyone else’s DNA!\nROGER: Without DNA pattern to recognize, the transmat can’t tell flesh from ice.\nDOCTOR: Fine. We’ve got her coat, that will have plenty of her DNA.\nROGER: It needs living, moving DNA. How else can it compare? It fastens onto the DNA and traces that out, works out the whole body. If it didn’t analyze the DNA, it would beam back whatever it fastened on to first, an arm or a heart.\nTOASTY: Ewww.\nROGER: It doesn’t have to be her DNA, though. It can be yours.\nDOCTOR: Mine?\nROGER: Step onto the pad. Let me beam out your DNA, analyze it through the transmat buffer. We’d have the living DNA model right here in the buffer and your daughter would match it closely enough.\nDOCTOR: Flip is not my daughter.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 50\nROGER: Ah. Then you’d better go get her before she dies.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 51\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 30. EXT. LOCH LOMOND. NIGHT\nDOCTOR WHO: (FLIP IS STRAINING AGAIN, TRYING TO MOVE A BROKEN LEG. SHE’S REACHING FOR A SHARD OF METAL FROM THE MICROLITE’S FRAME. )\nDOCTOR WHO: ITRON/WIRRN: (D) Who are you? Tell me.\nFLIP: (INTO RADIO) If you’re not going to help, clear the line. I haven’t got conference calls on this thing.\nFLIP: (F/X FLIP STRAINS OUT AGAIN — AND THIS TIME THERE’S A SCRAPE OF\nMETAL: SHE’S REACHED THE FRAME BEHIND HER. )\nFLIP: All right! At last.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 52\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 31. EXT. LOCH LOMOND. NEAR INCHFAD ISLE. NIGHT\nDOCTOR WHO: (THE DOCTOR AND VERONICA START TRUDGING OVER THE ICE. IT’S NOT AS WINDY AS IT IS BY FLIP.)\nDOCTOR: Right... here we go.\nVERONICA: The loch looks so much bigger now we’re on it.\nDOCTOR: It’s because it’s night. Torches only show so far, makes your mind imagine it’s really never-ending. Just concentrate on one step at a time.\nVERONICA: If we could step normally we’d be a lot faster. Or if it were just a bit more slippery, we could slide. Are you okay on the ice, Doctor?\nTOASTY: Hey! Wait!\nVERONICA: Toasty, get back to the house.\nTOASTY: I’ve brought my coat. You’1l need it for Flip.\nVERONICA: That’s my girl, thanks.\nVERONICA: Now, get back before you freeze over. We’1ll radio-phone in every ten minutes.\nDOCTOR: Tell your father to try scanning the loch. I think we might need to know more about it than we do.\nTOASTY: He says he’s busy.\nVERONICA: Fine. But you stay with him. Don’t wander around the house. We don’t know how near the Wirrn are.\nTOASTY: I will. Good luck.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 53\nDOCTOR: Do you know, I’ve been thinking about those Wirrn. But it’s not what I’ve been really focusing on.\nVERONICA: Of course not, you’re worried about your friend.\nDOCTOR: I’m wondering what happened to you fifteen years ago.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 54\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 32. EXT. LOCH LOMOND. NIGHT\nDOCTOR WHO: (F/X A SCRAPE OF METAL, DIGGING INTO THE ICE AND THEN A\nCRACKING: FLIP HAS CUT INTO THE ICE, SEPARATED HERSELF FROM IT.)\nFLIP: YES! YES! That’s it! (SIGH OF RELIEF) All I need now is a frostbite hospital and hot coffee. OH!\nFLIP: Coffee, bandages, a month off work and a blood transfusion. It’s not much to ask.\nDOCTOR: (D) Flip? How are you?\nFLIP: (INTO RADIO) I’ve beaten the ice one-nil.\nDOCTOR: (D) You’ve got your cheek free?\nFLIP: (INTO RADIO) Yes. But the loch’s winning on aggregate. My wound’s opened up again, it’s not much but I’m bleeding. Feeling a bit dizzy now.\nDOCTOR: (D) Find the microlite’s fabric: you should be able to make a bandage. It’1ll support your ribs too.\nFLIP: (INTO RADIO) Good idea.\nDOCTOR: (D) We’re well on our way. Heading out across the ice to you now.\nFLIP: I’1ll tidy up.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 55\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 33. INT. BUCHMAN HOUSE. NIGHT\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX TRANSMAT CONTROLS: ROGER IS SETTING COORDINATES, BEGINNING SCANS, TWIDDLING)\nTOASTY: Dad, Mum says she’1ll check in every ten minutes.\nROGER: Hmm? Fine.\nTOASTY: Can I do anything?\nROGER: Bit busy, Toasty, I’1ll be with you in a minute.\nTOASTY: Please. I want to help.\nTOASTY: I forgot. The Doctor wants you to scan the loch.\nROGER: Yet again, I’m ahead of this Doctor. That’s what I’m doing.\nROGER: (FX: HE OPERATES MORE CONTROLS AND THEY RESPOND WITH NOTIFICATION BLEEPS IMMEDIATELY. )\nROGER: Let me show you this part.\nTOASTY: Looks like a map of the loch.\nROGER: Very good. I’ve narrowed the focus to Loch Lomond. Now we go deeper, find a lifeform layer. It’s going to show us —\nTOASTY: It’1ll show us where Flip is. And Mum and the Doctor.\nROGER: We’ll be able to tell them exactly how far — oh.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 56\nTOASTY: What’s all that?\nROGER: Give me your radio-phone.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 57\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 34. EXT. LOCH LOMOND. NEAR INCHFAD ISLE. NIGHT\nVERONICA: We came here seventeen, eighteen years ago, I think.\nDOCTOR: Try flexing your feet every few steps. Don’t want them freezing.\nVERONICA: Okay, right. I believe we were the first of the Nerva City colonies. Certainly the northernmost. But then we were recalled.\nDOCTOR: Why? Wait — watch where you’re stepping.\nVERONICA: It’s only a branch.\nDOCTOR: Just walk around them. Nerva City recalled you because of the weather warning?\nVERONICA: Looks like they had a point. We were all recalled, every colony.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 58\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 35. EXT. LOCH LOMOND. NIGHT\nFLIP: Break myself off the ice, check. Make a splint for my leg. I’m becoming my own NHS frontline service.\nFLIP: STAND UP, FLIP! Losing it, girl. Come on.\nFLIP: Right, why did I want to get on my feet again?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 59\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 36. EXT. LOCH LOMOND. NEAR INCHFAD ISLE. NIGHT\nDOCTOR: Earth’s recovered remarkably from the solar flares over the past few thousand years but the whole ecosystem was damaged. Dramatic climate changes, variable radiation...\nVERONICA: That’s what they told us. Radiation clouds. Thought we’d be back in the city for a month. But we’re only back now because Roger lobbied to restart the colonies.\nROGER: (D) Doctor, come in.\nDOCTOR: (INTO RADIO) Yes, Roger, we’re here. I think we’ve come about a quarter of a mile.\nROGER: (D) Turn back now.\nROGER: SCENE 37. INT. BUCHMAN HOUSE. NIGHT\nTOASTY: They can’t turn back! What about Flip?\nROGER: Shush, Toasty. (INTO RADIO) Doctor, do you hear me?\nDOCTOR: (D) We hear you. What’s happening?\nROGER: (INTO RADIO) I’ve managed to scan the loch. But I can’t tell where Flip is because she’s not the only lifeform on the ice.\nVERONICA: (D) Of course she isn’t, we’re out here too.\nROGER: (INTO RADIO) So that would account for three. What about the other four hundred or so?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 60\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 38. EXT. LOCH LOMOND. NIGHT\nFLIP: (INTO RADIO) Doctor, are you there?\nFLIP: IRON/WIRRN: (D) I’m here.\nFLIP: You again! Great.\nFLIP: IRON/WIRRN: (D) Don’t you want to meet in person?\nFLIP: (INTO RADIO) And what do women usually say when you ask that?\nFLIP: Oh, terrific. Made him laugh. Now I’1l never shake him.\nDOCTOR: (D) Flip? Is that you?\nFLIP: (INTO RADIO) Me and my number-one fan. How far have you got?\nDOCTOR: (D) Coming up to a quarter mile now. If we keep on this line we’re going to hit Inchconnachan Island. Should be able to walk over that quickly, pick up some speed.\nFLIP: (INTO RADIO) Okay, good. But I’m not alone out here.\nFLIP: SCENE 39. EXT. LOCH LOMOND. NEAR INCHCONNACHAN ISLAND. NIGHT\nVERONICA: She must’ve heard Roger.\nDOCTOR: (INTO RADIO) Yes, we know, Flip. I’m not expecting problems.\nFLIP: (D) You haven’t been talking to him like I have.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 61\nVERONICA: Roger radio-phoned her first. Scared her to death.\nFLIP: (D) Are you still there? I’m going to start walking towards you, okay?\nDOCTOR: (INTO RADIO) If you can. But be careful. And avoid the branches.\nDOCTOR: SCENE 40. EXT. LOCH LOMOND. NIGHT\nFLIP: (INTO RADIO) Yeah, they’re creeping me out. Listen, the microlite span into the ice so I can’t see which way direction I was flying. But the pieces are pretty much in a straight line. So I figure if I just line up with that and start walking...\nDOCTOR: (D) You’1ll either meet us or —\nFLIP: (INTO RADIO) — or end up at the Aldochlay transmat substation.\nFLIP: SCENE 41. EXT. LOCH LOMOND. NEAR INCHCONNACHAN ISLAND. NIGHT\nDOCTOR: (INTO RADIO) Just what I’d do. (TO VERONICA) She’s going to bleed more if she moves but she stands a better chance than standing still.\nVERONICA: We’d best pick up some speed.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 62\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 42. EXT. LOCH LOMOND. NIGHT\nFLIP: Walking, then. I need a walking song. Madonna. Frozen. Vanilla Ice. Ice Ice Baby. Paloma Faith. Stone Cold Sober.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 63\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 43. INT. BUCHMAN TRANSMAT. NIGHT\nTOASTY: Is Mum really in danger?\nROGER: I’ve told them the facts.\nTOASTY: Shouldn’t we keep scanning the loch? See if anything moves toward them?\nROGER: It’s taken me twenty years to get back, I’m not losing this chance.\nTOASTY: Well, can I help?\nROGER: You're going to be vital, Toasty.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 64\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 44. EXT. LOCH LOMOND. INCHCONNACHAN ISLAND. NIGHT\nDOCTOR WHO: (VERONICA AND THE DOCTOR ARE STEPPING OFF THE ICE AND ONTO THE ISLAND. )\nVERONICA: At last, some land. Come on, Doctor, we can run for a bit.\nDOCTOR: Watch where you step.\nVERONICA: Why —\nVERONICA: Oh, I feel sick. What is it? Doctor, it’s warm. Sticky.\nDOCTOR: Step out of it and make sure you wipe your boot and — not with your hands! Not your hands. Wipe it on the ground.\nVERONICA: If I can find a spot that — oh, the stench! I’m going to throw.\nDOCTOR: Come on, we’ll have to be careful. The whole island is covered in pupae.\nVERONICA: Wirrn pupae? That’s.. it’s revolting.\nDOCTOR: It’s fascinating. Wirrn only land on planets for oxygen and to breed. The Wirrn queen plants eggs in a lifeform and then when the eggs gestate, they eat the lifeform from the inside.\nVERONICA: God.\nDOCTOR: But I think Wirrn have been here a long time and these pupae are new. There are some more husks over there and they don’t look terribly old either\nVERONICA: What says they haven’t just landed today?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 65\nDOCTOR: The branches. They’re the mandibles of full-grown Wirrn trapped under the ice. Trapped for twenty years. That’s how we get to 400 lifeforms.\nVERONICA: They’ve been trapped that long but they’re still alive?\nDOCTOR: Oh, they can’t all be in there or we wouldn’t have the pupae. But Wirrn can easily survive being frozen. They live in space. But as cold as space is, it doesn’t trap you, immobilise you the way ice does.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 66\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 45. EXT. LOCH LOMOND. NIGHT\nFLIP: Cold as Ice. Is that Whitesnake, or Foreigner? Nah. MOP.\nFLIP: (IRON/WIRRN IS 50 METRES AWAY BUT WITH THE WIND HE SOUNDS NIGHTMARISHLY CLOSE ONE MOMENT AND FAR AWAY THE NEXT. )\nFLIP: IRON/WIRRN: I don’t know these songs.\nFLIP: (INTO RADIO) Did I leave this on? Are you listening to my radio-phone?\nFLIP: IRON/WIRRN: No. (BEAT) That’s right. Stop walking. I can see the hairs on your neck from here. Funny.\nFLIP: Hilarious. I can’t see you. How far behind me are you?\nFLIP: IRON/WIRRN: It doesn’t matter. I’m not going to kill you, you know.\nFLIP: Somehow I’m not reassured. I can’t see you. It’s too dark.\nFLIP: IRON/WIRRN: There! Right there. Turning around, you just looked directly at me. Can’t you see?\nFLIP: Apparently not. And now I’m not sure which way I was going. Can’t they put lights up?\nFLIP: IRON/WIRRN: Tell me one thing before I touch your hand.\nFLIP: God, come on.\nFLIP: IRON/WIRRN: Where did you get a radio-phone?\nFLIP: Let’s all have a little think about that.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 67\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 46. EXT. LOCH LOMOND. INCHCONNACHAN ISLAND. NIGHT\nVERONICA: Pretty stupid, then, are they? I mean, getting trapped in the ice.\nDOCTOR: I expect it was quite clever. If a swarm landed here around the time of your recall, they’1ll have known about the radiation. Or lost enough of their number to it. Moving into the loch must’ve seemed like a good, temporary idea. Doesn’t answer the question of where these hosts came from.\nVERONICA: I suppose they didn’t have a Nerva City of their own to go back to.\nDOCTOR: Well, factor in the radical climate change... I’ve said it before, human beings are indomitable. But they are also the only species to have found out that when you boil a frog slowly enough, it doesn’t notice until it’s too late. Wirrn landed in the loch and it froze over before they knew it was a problem.\nVERONICA: Frozen Wirrn. Wish I hadn’t asked.\nDOCTOR: Then it’s my turn to ask. Start with your son’s name.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 68\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 47. INT. BUCHMAN TRANSMAT. NIGHT\nROGER: Toasty, it’s time tell you some things about your brother.\nTOASTY: I know Mum doesn’t want you to tell me. I’ve heard the rows.\nROGER: Your mother isn’t here and you are. You need to know.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 69\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 48. EXT. LOCH LOMOND. INCHCONNACHAN ISLAND. NIGHT\nVERONICA: Never thought I’d be glad to be back on ice.\nDOCTOR: Veronica. I asked you a question.\nVERONICA: Iron. My son’s name was Iron.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 70\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 49. EXT. LOCH LOMOND. NIGHT\nDOCTOR WHO: (FLIP HAS BEEN TRYING TO RUN BUT IT’S SO HARD ON HER BROKEN LEG, EVEN WITH A SPLINT. )\nDOCTOR WHO: IRON/WIRRN: (D) Is there really any point running, Flip?\nFLIP: (INTO RADIO) If you’ve got to radio me now, I'd say yes. Too quick for you, am I?\nFLIP: IRON/WIRRN: (D) Yes, that’s it. Do you know that you’ve left a bright red blood trail?\nFLIP: (INTO RADIO) Doctor! Are you close?\nFLIP: IRON/WIRRN: (D) You can’t call so long as my radio holds the circuit.\nFLIP: (INTO RADIO) Who are you?\nFLIP: IRON/WIRRN: (CHIRRUP) (D) I’m called Iron. And I want to know where you got a radio-phone.\nFLIP: Got to rush.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 71\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 50. INT. BUCHMAN TRANSMAT. NIGHT\nROGER: You were only five when he died. So much we couldn’t face telling you. But I need your help me now, Toasty.\nTOASTY: Yes, Dad.\nROGER: The four of us, we were ordered back to Nerva City like everybody else. We thought it would be for a few weeks. The City was smaller then than it is now, of course. Hard to find a place to stay.\nTOASTY: Right...\nROGER: Except your mother knew people in the technicians’ quarter. You and she transmatted back, so she could find somewhere for all of us, so we could stay together. So, while you were gone, Iron and I secured the house. Locked up the outbuildings. Made the junction boxes safe.\nTOASTY: What happened? Dad?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 72\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENES 51-54. DELETED SCENE 55. EXT. LOCH LOMOND. NEAR INCHCONNACHAN ISLAND. NIGHT\nVERONICA: I left Toasty with friends, transmatted back and... Roger had gone outside to check something, he’d come back and he’d found that Iron was gone.\nDOCTOR: The transmat?\nVERONICA: There was no log. He was just gone. But then I found his jumper by the loch. Wet. My Iron drowned in this wretched loch.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 73\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 56. INT. BUCHMAN TRANSMAT. NIGHT\nROGER: This is hardest part to tell you, Toasty, but I planted Iron’s jumper so that your mother would find it and accept that Iron had drowned.\nTOASTY: What-? Dad-?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 74\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 57. EXT. ALDOCHLAY TRANSMAT SUBSTATION. NIGHT\nDOCTOR WHO: (FLIP IS WHEEZING FROM EFFORT: AS STRONG AS SHE IS, HER INJURIES ARE FEROCIOUS AND THE LOSS OF BLOOD IS AFFECTING HER MENTALLY. )\nFLIP: Please don’t let this be a mirage. (INTO RADIO) Doctor, I’ve found the transmat substation! Doctor? Are you there? I’ve found a control panel on the door. How do I open it?\nFLIP: IRON/WIRRN: (OVER RADIO) You don’t.\nFLIP: Oh, blimey. Just get off the line, will you-?!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 75\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 58. INT. BUCHMAN TRANSMAT. NIGHT\nROGER: Iron and I were playing with the transmat and I beamed him out into the loch.\nTOASTY: Dad!\nROGER: And — I beamed him inside a Wirrn.\nTOASTY: You killed him?\nROGER: No! No! I thought I had but the beaming, it was an early version of the software, it fastened onto life and beamed Iron into it.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 76\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 59: EXT. TRANSMAT SUBSTATION\nDOCTOR WHO: (FLIP PRESSES BUTTONS ON THE DOOR CONTROL. THEY BLEEP BUT DON’T DO ANYTHING ELSE. )\nFLIP: Okay. So it’s not one-two-three-four.\nFLIP: IRON/WIRRN: Perhaps if we push together. (CHIRRUP LAUGH)\nFLIP: Oh, my — [God-!] What are you?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 77\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 60. INT. BUCHMAN TRANSMAT\nROGER: He’s out there right now. He’s Wirrn but he’s still Iron inside and I can get him back. Get the human boy back. Don’t you want that? Toasty?\nTOASTY: Of — of course.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 78\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 61. EXT. TRANSMAT SUBSTATION\nFLIP: Please — please stay away.\nFLIP: IRON/WIRRN: Girls are so weak.\nFLIP: You’re hardly a boy. Oh! Oh! Revolting. You’re — you’re an\nFLIP: enormous, great, sweaty insect.\nFLIP: IRON/WIRRN: I’m Iron.\nFLIP: You said. I’m Flip. Let’s see who’s weak. (EFFORT)\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 79\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 62: INT. ALDOCHLAY SUBSTATION\nFLIP: Blimey, power still works. Fantastic.\nFLIP: (IRON/WIRRN CHIRRUPS BEHIND HER — - BUT SHE BANGS THE DOOR SHUT\nFLIP: - BUT IRON/WIRRN SLICES THROUGH, A MANDIBLE CUTTING THE FRAIL WOOD APART)\nFLIP: Aah! Branch. Not branch. Oh no. (INTO RADIO) Doctor! Please,\nFLIP: come in. Doctor!!!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 80\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 63. EXT. LOCH LOMOND. NEAR INCHCONNACHAN ISLAND. NIGHT\nDOCTOR: (INTO RADIO) Flip? Are you calling me?\nFLIP: (D) Yes! I’m at the substation! But Doctor! There’s this thing breaking in, calls itself Iron! (TO IRON) BACK OFF!\nFLIP: (OVER THE RADIO, THEY HEAR HER THROWING EQUIPMENT AT TRON/WIRRN )\nDOCTOR: (INTO RADIO) Flip! What’s happening?\nVERONICA: No. No. It’s been fifteen years, it can’t be...\nDOCTOR: (INTO RADIO) Flip!\nVERONICA: Can’t be. Isn’t. (SHE STUMBLES)\nDOCTOR: I’ve got you. Lean on me.\nVERONICA: Tell me — tell me she’s only saying it.\nDOCTOR: She is saying Iron. But it’s not what you think, Veronica.\nVERONICA: Sounds to me like my son is alive. (INTO RADIO) Flip, is Iron all right?\nFLIP: (OVER RADIO)Er... well... He’s doing better than I am!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 81\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 64. INT. BUCHMAN TRANSMAT\nROGER: I can’t do it without you, Toasty.\nTOASTY: Whatever you need, I’1l1 do it.\nROGER: I just need your DNA. You won’t even know I’ve done it.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 82\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 65. EXT. ALDOCHLAY TRANSMAT SUBSTATION. NIGHT\nFLIP: (INTO RADIO) Branches. More branches, at the window... And the other window... And the door—!\nFLIP: (CRASH: THE WOODEN BUILDING IS STORMED BY WIRRN. A DOZEN ADULT\nFLIP: WIRRN, CHIRRUP-SCUTTLING )\nDOCTOR: (D) Flip! Is Iron back?\nDOCTOR: IRON/WIRRN: Meet my new family, Flip.\nFLIP: (INTO RADIO) Help me, Doctor! There’s — there’s ten, twelve, them — oh no, no — (TRIPS ON SOMETHING, STUMBLES) OW!!!\nDOCTOR: (D) Look for the transmat!\nFLIP: (INTO RADIO) I think I just tripped over it.\nFLIP: IRON/WIRRN: Don’t go, Flip.\nFLIP: (INTO RADIO) The Wirrn, they’re between me and the controls. What do I do, Doctor? What do I —\nFLIP: of\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 8&3\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 66. EXT. LOCH LOMOND. NEAR INCHCONNACHAN ISLAND. NIGHT\nDOCTOR: (INTO RADIO) Flip? Are you there?\nVERONICA: Someone’s beamed her out of range.\nDOCTOR: Didn’t sound like there was time to set coordinates. She stepped on a pad and it sent her wherever the last person went.\nVERONICA: Just our luck if that was the house. (INTO RADIO) Roger, Toasty, are you there?\nVERONICA: SCENE 67. INT. BUCHMAN TRANSMAT. NIGHT\nTOASTY: Like this?\nROGER: Exactly. Right on the centre of the pad. Stand still now.\nTOASTY: Won’t Iron appear where I am?\nROGER: Pads won’t let you beam two people in at the same time from different places. You’d get two sets of DNA blending together, very nasty. So no, we do this, then you clear the pad.\nVERONICA: (D) Roger, Toasty, come in please!\nTOASTY: (INTO RADIO) Can’t talk, Mum, I’m helping Dad!\nDOCTOR: (D) Toasty? Has Flip transmatted back?\nTOASTY: (INTO RADIO) No. And I’m on the pad, I’d have seen her.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 84\nROGER: Nearly there.\nVERONICA: (D) What are you doing on the pad? Toasty?\nVERONICA: SCENE 68. EXT. LOCH LOMOND. NEAR INCHCONNACHAN ISLAND. NIGHT\nVERONICA: (TO DOCTOR) Why’s Roger playing with the transmat now? He didn’t beam Flip back.\nDOCTOR: And we know he can’t transmat anyone to Nerva City. (SUDDENLY REALIZING) Roger’s looking for Iron.\nVERONICA: We've got to tell him he’s safe. (INTO RADIO) Roger, Iron is —\nDOCTOR: No, Veronica, he’s trying to beam out Toasty’s DNA.\nDOCTOR: SCENE 69. INT. BUCHMAN TRANSMAT. NIGHT\nDOCTOR: (D) TOASTY! GET OFF THE PAD! GET OFF NOW!\nTOASTY: (INTO RADIO) No! I’m —\nROGER: Yes!\nTOASTY: - I’m helping my Daddy and —\nROGER: Now I’11 show you who’s the transmat expert, Doctor.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 85\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 70.

I promise. Your mother will be back soon, [and —]\nROGER: IRON/WIRRN:\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 96\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 78. EXT. LOCH LOMOND. NIGHT\nDOCTOR WHO: (DOCTOR AND VERONICA TRUDGING OVER ICE. BRANCH/MANDIBLES BEGIN TO MOVE, MAKING ICE CREAK. )\nDOCTOR: I do believe it’s nearly dawn.\nVERONICA: Brand new day. Doesn’t matter what I want, the sun keeps on rising.\nDOCTOR: Indeed, yes. (BEAT) Veronica...\nVERONICA: No more talking. Just let’s get home, save my Toasty and then somehow we’1ll all get away from this stinking place.\nDOCTOR: Yes, about that —\nVERONICA: What part of “Shut up, Doctor” is giving you such a hard time?\nDOCTOR: The part that points out all the mandibles on the ice are now leaning away from us.\nVERONICA: Where? Oh, I can see it. That’s great. I’m sure I’ve got frostbite, it hurts so much stepping over them. But they’re clearing the path for us.\nDOCTOR: Well, I agree they’re clearing the path. But is it really for us, I wonder?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 97\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 79. INT. NERVA CITY COUNCIL BUILDING. NIGHT.\nDARE: Okay, this screen’s got a geo map of the Earth but if we strip it back —\nFLIP: We’re in New York!\nSHEER: I don’t know that name.\nDARE: There was once a settlement here called that, yes. But there’s a natural harbour that protects us. That’s why we built Nerva City here. Now, I’m stripping back terrain to show a diagram map of the major transmat routes.\nSHEER: They don’t really curve across the globe like that, they go straight-lines. But it shows you the system.\nFLIP: Not as many as I thought, somehow.\nDARE: We've re-established seven colonies, I’ve played concerts at five of them.\nSHEER: (TO FLIP) Dare’s a guitarist off-hours.\nFLIP: You are? Thought you ran the place.\nDARE: Bosses don’t work at midnight on Olympic night.\nSHEER: And when your boss is Paul Dessay —\nFLIP: Oh! Dour old guy. Bit of a misery.\nDARE: See? You do know him.\nFLIP: Saw him on telly.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 98\nDARE: He does like cameras, that man. Right, seven colony lines, then there are supply routes from the water factories on the equator. But that’s it. Aldochlay was going to route transmat traffic over that side of the globe. We haven’t reopened it.\nFLIP: Then either Wirrn are good with spanners or whoever made it really knew their stuff. The second I stepped inside, power came on.\nSHEER: Dare? Could that be where it’s coming from?\nFLIP: Where what?\nDARE: Sheer, do we really know this woman?\nSHEER: I can vouch for her. She knows Toasty.\nDARE: Good enough. Okay, Flip — I brought Sheer back from the station early because we’ve been getting interference on communications.\nFLIP: Interference? What sort of interference?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 99\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 80. INT. BUCHMAN TRANSMAT. NIGHT\nDOCTOR WHO: IRON/WIRRN: (D) Do you remember how I used to beg you to transmat me, Dad?\nROGER: I remember.\nROGER: IRON/WIRRN: (D) Disappear there, reappear here. Magical. The whole world but a step away.\nROGER: Please, Iron, I would transmat you back if I could.\nROGER: IRON/WIRRN: (D) But you won’t. You can’t. You want to leave me here.\nROGER: FIFTEEN YEARS! Iron! Fifteen years I’ve gone over those logs. Took me a week to find your message. One radio-phone squawk in the middle of a log. Your voice. Sounding — sounding like this. Like you do now. You and not you. I know you’re Wirrn, Iron. But you’re still my boy.\nROGER: IRON/WIRRN: (D) It doesn’t take years to get to Loch Lomond.\nROGER: By then we were back in Nerva City. Quarantined. Refused travel. They said it was uninhabitable. Dangerously cold.\nROGER: IRON/WIRRN: (D) I know the cold. I’ve come to know the cold.\nROGER: But I’m here! I did it! I made it back! And now I’m the best transmat scientist there is. I’m not just going to ‘transmat you back, son, I’m going to ‘transmat you right out of that\nROGER: Wirrn body. Transmat the human Iron DNA. Bring back my boy.\nROGER: IRON/WIRRN: (D) Then transmat me now. I love the transmat. The whole world a step away.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 100\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 81. DELETED SCENE 82. EXT. LOCH LOMOND. MORNING.\nDOCTOR: The sun is definitely coming up. I’m sure I can see Inchfad Isle. We’re very close.\nVERONICA: The ice is cracking. The loch is melting.\nDOCTOR: Oh, we'll be fine. The entire loch is frozen, it’s not just a top layer. Take years to melt.\nVERONICA: But how many years will it take those Wirrn to climb out and join their friends?\nDOCTOR: How are those frozen feet of yours? Do you suppose you can run?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 101\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 83. INT. BUCHMAN TRANSMAT. MORNING.\nDOCTOR WHO: IRON/WIRRN:\nDOCTOR WHO: (D) Father. Transmat me now. We’re heading to the island anyway.\nROGER: (INTO RADIO) What do you mean?\nROGER: IRON/WIRRN: (D) I’1l be with you soon. But I want the transmat. I need the transmat, Dad. I need you.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 102\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 84. INT. NERVA CITY COUNCIL BUILDING. NIGHT.\nFLIP: Play that again.\nSHEER: It’s nothing, I’ve analysed it. No audio message, not even compressed. No subcarrier content, nothing. Just a radio squawk.\nDARE: Too atonal for me. Can you hear something more in it?\nFLIP: All I know is that I heard it a lot on the ice. And practically every time I did, the next thing I heard was Iron.\nSHEER: I thought you saw him.\nFLIP: Just at the end. And if he thought building up to it was a good idea... He sounds human. Sounds like a teenage boy with a weird chirruping whistle. But he’s this... insect. This giant insect.\nSHEER: Wirrn. They are back.\nDARE: Sheer, go get Paul. He’1ll listen to you.\nSHEER: And what will I tell him?\nDARE: That dinner’s over, we’re being invaded. I’m shutting down all transmats.\nFLIP: I came here to get you to open them!\nDARE: Flip, you saw Wirrn in the substation, we’re hearing comms interference on the network. Doesn’t take a leap to know the Wirrn are working on getting transmat access.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 103\nSHEER: Dare, let me ‘transmat over to Loch Lomond. I can work on their local transmat, free the lockouts and bring Veronica and Toasty back. Won’t touch the rest of the network.\nFLIP: And you'll get Roger and the Doctor too.\nSHEER: Doctor too?\nDARE: No. They’re after the transmat and we have a simple solution: I can pull the plug. So I’m pulling it.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 104\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 85. INT. BUCHMAN TRANSMAT. MORNING.\nROGER: (INTO RADIO) We used to fish in the loch, Iron. First fish man\nROGER: had caught anywhere on Earth in thousands of years. I wonder who re-introduced fish? Probably the GalSec lot.\nROGER: IRON/WIRRN: (D) We can fish again, Dad.\nROGER: (INTO RADIO) What’s it been like?\nROGER: IRON/WIRRN: (D) I’ve been waiting for my Dad to find me.\nROGER: (INTO RADIO) Right. Right. And now I have. Stand by, I’m bringing you in. Not leaving you alone one single moment more. (F/X TRANSMAT STARTS TO HUM —\nROGER: - ENTER THE DOCTOR AND VERONICA)\nVERONICA: Roger!\nDOCTOR: Don’t complete the transmat.\nROGER: I’m bringing Iron back.\nVERONICA: AND LOSE TOASTY?\nROGER: Aaah!\nVERONICA: Shut it down, Doctor! Shut it down, now!\nROGER: No — you mustn’t —\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 105\nROGER: Please. My boy!\nVERONICA: Our children!\nDOCTOR: (INTO RADIO) Iron, I asked you nicely.\nDOCTOR: ITRON/WIRRN: (D) Too late, Doctor, I can feel the transmat caressing me.\nDOCTOR: Charming image. (F/X BUTTONS AND BLEEPS CONCLUDE)\nROGER: You’ve stopped him mid-transmat. He could be dead!\nDOCTOR: I am rather better at this than you, do try to keep up. I’ve stopped the cycle: Iron is right back wherever he was on the loch.\nVERONICA: Beamed out to the ice again.\nDOCTOR: Listen to me. Iron died. Fifteen years ago. That day, that minute. This is his voice, this is his memory, his experience, but it’s not him. It is Wirrn.\nVERONICA: And Toasty?\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid I can’t tell yet. The cycle begins by zeroing out\nDOCTOR: the previous transmat headers so if the data survived then it is still there, the transmat just can’t find it. I’1ll have to point it in the right direction.\nROGER: This is all rubbish, you can’t reconstitute someone when they’ve been transmatted.\nVERONICA: He’s right. Why did I believe in you?\nDOCTOR: I have that effect. With good reason. Checking the data store... looks firm.. Looks like an automated backup has started.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 106\nVERONICA: That’1ll take ages.\nROGER: When did you become the transmat expert?\nVERONICA: Years listening to you.\nDOCTOR: Process running.\nDOCTOR: (F/X THE TRANSMAT FRITZES. ELECTRICITY IS BEING\nROGER: A power cut. Why a power cut?\nDOCTOR: Either you’ve not been paying your bills, or...\nVERONICA: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Or the Wirrn are eating the power lines.\nDOCTOR: INTERRUPTED. )\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 107\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 86: EXT.

NIGHT\nPAUL: (ON STAGE, OVER MIC) Hear me, Nerva City! Yes! It’s been a tremendous evening once more, a time when we have rightly honoured our past by re-enacting the Olympic. Our ancestors, every fourth of a year, celebrated this festival. A torch passing from one season to the next. But you know, the symbolism is but one part of —\nSHEER: (INTO MICROPHONE) Sorry, everybody. (TO PAUL) Sorry, sir. But you’re needed.\nPAUL: Oh. Well, everybody, remember your duties tomorrow and —\nSHEER: (GRABBING HIM) This way, sir.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 109\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 88. EXT. LOCH LOMOND BUCHMAN HOUSE. MORNING.\nROGER: What — what is that thing?\nVERONICA: A Wirrn pupae.\nROGER: Is it dead?\nDOCTOR: Bit right through the power line. Electrocuted on the spot.\nVERONICA: But now we know how to kill them.\nDOCTOR: This is the warmest spot for miles around. Irresistible. They’1ll be coming in force. Adults, too.\nVERONICA: And what happens then?\nDOCTOR: Well, if they don’t slice us apart with their mandibles, I expect they’1ll plant their eggs in us.\nROGER: I feel sick.\nVERONICA: Doctor! Look! Out on the loch!\nDOCTOR: What did I tell you?\nROGER: Wirrn! Hundreds of them!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 110\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 89: EXT. LOCH LOMOND\nDOCTOR WHO: IRON/WIRRN:\nDOCTOR WHO: Surround the house. Protect the transmat but take anyone who leaves the building.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 111\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 90: DELETED SCENE 91: EXT. BUCHMAN HOUSE\nROGER: The horizon just moved. Did you see it? They’re across the whole horizon.\nDOCTOR: Back to the house, both of you.\nVERONICA: No chance, Doctor. These things are killed by electricity and we've got a live cable right here.\nROGER: Veronica, don’t. Come back with us.\nVERONICA: If we end up sliced and poached, nobody’s going to be here to reconstitute Toasty. Isn’t that right, Doctor?\nROGER: Veronica! Beside you!\nROGER: (F/X WIRRN PUPAE EVEN CLOSER — AND VERONICA GRABS THE FRITZING CABLE, SWINGS. PUPAE SNAPS AWAY, BACK OUT OF REACH. )\nDOCTOR: Veronica. Just scare the pupae off, keep them away from the island. Roger and I will get Toasty and figure out how to transmat us all away.\nVERONICA: Toasty is all that matters. You leave this lot to me. (F/X SHE SWINGS THE CABLE AGAIN, PUPAE SLITHER ANGRILY)\nDOCTOR: Veronica, you’re feet away from the loch. Ice doesn’t conduct electricity very well but water does. It’s melting fast now so do be careful not to fry yourself, hm?\nVERONICA: And the Wirrn?\nDOCTOR: We just need a few minutes.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 112\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 92. INT. NERVA CITY COUNCIL BUILDING\nFLIP: You agreed!\nDARE: I still do. But I’ve switched off all transmats, I’ve the authority to do that. What I don’t have is the power to switch one back on. Nobody can transmat to Loch Lomond.\nPAUL: Dare, stand away from this intruder.\nFLIP: Me?\nSHEER: Flip, Dare, I’ve explained —\nPAUL: And I’ve heard enough. Dare, how can you believe this nonsense?\nDARE: I started with the evidence and worked backwards. Sir.\nFLIP: You’re Paul, aren’t you?\nPAUL: And you’re well briefed for someone who says she’s just transmatted in.\nDARE: Sir, let’s just sort this out.\nSHEER: We’ll all transmat over to Loch Lomond.\nFLIP: Great.\nPAUL: No.\nFLIP: Why not? They need help!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 113\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 93. INT. BUCHMAN TRANSMAT. MORNING.\nROGER: The transmat was supposed to copy out Toasty’s DNA.\nDOCTOR: Transmats don’t copy DNA, they move it from one place to another.\nROGER: This one does. I spent years working it out. Wrote the software to turn this pad into what I needed.\nDOCTOR: Humans. Not so much indomitable as exasperating.\nROGER: I’m sorry?\nDOCTOR: You may have written your local software superbly — I suppose that’s possible — but this pad runs on a network of transmats. Your system beamed out Toasty’s DNA but the network lock told it to not transmat it anywhere, including back into her. So it should have stayed in the system.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 114\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 94. INT. NERVA CITY COUNCIL BUILDING. NIGHT.\nPAUL: What do you want, girl? Are you trying to stop the Olympic?\nFLIP: I’m talking about Wirrn, you’re talking about sport?!\nDARE: What has sport got to do with the Olympic?\nSHEER: I’m with Flip, we have to focus on the Wirrn.\nPAUL: There are no Wirrn.\nSHEER: Then let one of us prove it. One way or the other. What would it cost us?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 115\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 95. EXT. LOCH LOMOND BUCHMAN HOUSE. MORNING.\nDOCTOR WHO: (F/X WIRRN EVERYWHERE: VERONICA SWINGS THE CABLE AND IT CONNECTS WITH ELECTRIC SHOCKS. )\nVERONICA: (INTO RADIO) Doctor! We’re surrounded!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 116\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 96. INT. BUCHMAN TRANSMAT. MORNING.\nDOCTOR: (INTO RADIO) Just a minute, Veronica.\nROGER: The transmat buffer is huge, it’s built to hold the images of as many people as can stand on the pad.\nDOCTOR: And it’s swamped with data, I can’t tell what’s Toasty.\nROGER: I can. She’s my daughter. Copy my DNA out and you’1l be\nROGER: match.\nDOCTOR: You’d be lost the same way.\nROGER: Not now I know about the network precedence.\nROGER: pad, you run my routine and control it.\nDOCTOR: I’m beginning to change my mind about you, Roger.\nROGER: Do you think I’d let you do this if I still thought you\nROGER: idiot?\nDOCTOR: Get on the pad.\nDOCTOR: I’m on it...\nDOCTOR: Got it... Matching DNA...\nROGER: Toasty went through that.\nDOCTOR: Apparently not.\nDOCTOR: I put Toasty through that.\nDOCTOR: able to\nDOCTOR: I’'1l stand on the\nDOCTOR: were an\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 117\nROGER: What?\nDOCTOR: Your DNA doesn’t match anything still in the buffer.

Just a moment while it restarts...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 119\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 98. EXT. LOCH LOMOND BUCHMAN HOUSE. MORNING.\nVERONICA: Doctor! I can’t hold them!\nDOCTOR: (CALLING FROM OFF) Then leave it! Please, Veronica! Come back inside!\nDOCTOR: (ONE MORE FRITZING SHOCK OF THE CABLE AND VERONICA MAKES IT TO THE DOOR WITH THE DOCTOR. )\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 120\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 99: INT.

THEY’RE INSIDE BUT NOT IN THE TRANSMAT ROOM YET. )\nDOCTOR: Help me find a way to block the door.\nDOCTOR: Careful, you’1ll have someone’s eye out with that!\nVERONICA: Never mind that. Where’s the nearest power junction?\nDOCTOR: Power junction? Why?\nVERONICA: If only we could get out to run cables right into the loch, we [could —]\nDOCTOR: Veronica. There’s something you have to tell me.\nVERONICA: No time to talk, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Please, Veronica. I can’t get Toasty back if you don’t tell me. Veronica, who is Toasty’s father?\nVERONICA: You’re quicker than Roger is. Sheer. Sheer Jawn is Toasty’s Dad.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 121\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 100: NERVA CITY COUNCIL BUILDING\nSHEER: Flip, I’1l1 tell the Doctor you’re here.\nFLIP: Thanks.\nPAUL: Sheer, do no such thing. It’s probably a signal.\nFLIP: Oh, I give up.\nSHEER: Don’t worry, Flip. I’1l1l know the lockout codes, I’1l be beaming back with everybody soon.\nDARE: Almost there. Whole system was shut down, it’s taking — here, here we go. Power’s back on, systems are live.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 122\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 101. INT.

No!\nVERONICA: What are you doing? Have you found Toasty?\nROGER: I’ve found Iron! I’m transmatting him right out of the Wirrn.\nROGER: What’s — ? There are two signals.\nDOCTOR: You've not restored network precedence, someone else is beaming in. Someone from Nerva City. Override it! There’s nothing to tell the pad it’s getting two bodies instead of one signal.\nVERONICA: Oh, my God. Sheer!\nDOCTOR: His DNA’s blending, I can’t save him.\nSHEER: Veronica!\nSHEER: (SHEER SCREAMS — TRANSMAT HUM ENDS — AND IRON/WIRRN CHIRRUPS — AND SHEER DIES.

Let me know when Sheer returns.\nFLIP: Dare...\nDARE: I’m thinking the same thing. He shouldn’t have reopened the transmat network.\nFLIP: Send me to Loch Lomond.\nDARE: Do you ever just ask politely for what you want?\nFLIP: Do you know, that never seems to work for me.\nDARE: Try it some time. It’ll make a difference. Transmatting now.\nFLIP: Loch Lomond, here I come.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 127\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 105: INT.

Roger, run.\nVERONICA: Where to? Where can we possibly go now?\nROGER: Iron! I brought you here! I’1l never send you away again. This is someone else beaming in. Get off the pad.\nROGER: IRON/WIRRN:\nROGER: Sheer understands transmats. I don’t need you after all, father.\nVERONICA: ROGER!\nDOCTOR: (GRIM) Leave him, Veronica. He’s dead. Nothing we can do.\nDOCTOR: IRON/WIRRN: Stopping the transmat cycle.\nDOCTOR: Why? Is it getting too crowded in there?\nVERONICA: Take me too. Can you transmat me inside it? We’d all be together.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 128\nDOCTOR: I don’t think so.\nDOCTOR: IRON/WIRRN: What a clumsy timer design on the transmat.\nDOCTOR: What are you doing?\nDOCTOR: IRON/WIRRN: Undoing the lockouts. Now I know everything I need to know. I’m going to beam myself to Nerva City, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: You don’t want to stay here and talk about it? I can help you.\nDOCTOR: IRON/WIRRN: My eggs must be laid soon. And there is no better place than Nerva City.\nDOCTOR: One Wirrn against a city? You’d be better off here, with the rest of the swarm.\nDOCTOR: IRON/WIRRN:\nDOCTOR: The swarm is only waiting for me to transmat out.

You were beamed away by accident, Toasty.\nTOASTY: Like Iron? Dad did that to me?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 142\nVERONICA: Your father was killed trying to save you.\nDOCTOR: Something’s transmatting in.\nVERONICA: We've got to stop the cycle, they’1ll appear right in front of the Wirrn.\nVERONICA: (FX: DURING THE FOLLOWING, THE DOCTOR AND VERONICA OPEN ENGINE PANELS )\nDOCTOR: Look for access panels. There are no controls here, but we should be able to find the lines to short out the transmat.\nTOASTY: Could it be Dad?\nVERONICA: How did you do that, Doctor? I got to the power cables but no control lines.\nDOCTOR: The panels say the control lines rerouted, avoiding any damage I could do. But still the cycle stopped itself before anyone beamed in.\nTOASTY: What happened to the people transmatting in?\nDOCTOR: I suppose it’s a failsafe: keep the control lines working to finish the cycle but assume there’s a problem and cancel the transport.\nTOASTY: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: It wasn’t your father, Toasty. But no, they didn’t die. If it was even a person trying to get here.\nVERONICA: What else could it be?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 143\nTOASTY: Supplies? Nerva City tried to beam us more ration packs? What good is that?\nVERONICA: I’1ll tell you what I’d do. I’d have transmatted over a bomb.\nDOCTOR: Taking out the house doesn’t affect any Wirrn in the city, now, does it?\nVERONICA: There are hundreds of Wirrn on the loch. Any way you can kill Wirrn in their own swarm has to be a good idea. Even if not for US's\nDOCTOR: Well, if that was the plan, we’ve prevented that for now. We’re going to need the transmat, though. Veronica, check you’ve got the power cables attached. I’m going to rewire the control lines again.\nVERONICA: Transmat as a weapon. It’s got possibilities.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 144\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 107. INT. NERVA CITY COUNCIL BUILDING. NIGHT.\nDARE: Logs say the beacon got to all colonies...\nFLIP: Including —\nDARE: . except Loch Lomond. I’m sorry, Flip.\nFLIP: I don’t know what to do now. What about the rest of the colonies, how will we find out if they heard us?\nDARE: If the colonies start switching off their transmats, the network grid will shrink to just Nerva City. There’s no other way to tell.\nDARE: IRON/WIRRN-SHEER/WIRRN: You could just ask me.\nFLIP: Iron!\nFLIP: IRON/WIRRN-SHEER/WIRRN:\nFLIP: Iron and Sheer and more. One of whom knows that you’re reaching for the security hold, Dare. If you’re lucky, if there’s still a fission gun in there, it can’t harm me.\nDARE: My Sheer was better at keeping secrets. What do you want?\nDARE: IRON/WIRRN-SHEER/WIRRN: What we need. What we’ve got. Wherever there’s a transmat, there is Iron. I am everywhere on the face of this planet.\nPAUL: So let’s transmat you off the planet.\nFLIP: Where’ve you sent him?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 145\nDARE: Ported him into the sky. Right now he’s falling back to Earth,\nDARE: burning up in the atmosphere.\nFLIP: The Doctor wouldn’t approve — but thanks.\nDARE: One down, just a city full of Wirrn to go.\nFLIP: And no Doctor.\nDARE: Still, look on the bright side. That insect was\nDARE: fission gun.\nDARE: right about the\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 146\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 108. INT. BUCHMAN OUTHOUSE. MORNING.\nDOCTOR: Veronica? Control lines say there’s no power — because you’ve disconnected the power coupling cables.\nVERONICA: You said it, Doctor. We can use a weapon. I pulled power cables from the transmat engines and while you had your head in the panel controls, I connected the ends to the ice.\nTOASTY: I don’t understand what you’ve done. I don’t understand anything.\nVERONICA: Toasty, there are now power cables running into the loch. The next time we or anyone uses that transmat, anyone, anything in the water will be electrocuted and killed.\nDOCTOR: Hasn’t there been enough killing?\nVERONICA: Yes. By Wirrn.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 147\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 109. INT. NERVA CITY COUNCIL BUILDING. NIGHT.\nFLIP: Funny how quiet it is in here.\nDARE: Must be the only place that is. Two A.M. I should be singing in the Noah Centre. Wonder if anyone’s still alive out there. Wonder if Paul made it to his dinner.\nFLIP: Do you have any family, Dare?\nDARE: Just my guitar and — and I was going to say Sheer.\nFLIP: Sorry. Hard to grasp all the killing. Killing was always something in films and you knew it’d be all right in the end.\nDARE: Don’t see this turning out all right, do you?\nFLIP: No.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 148\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 110. INT. BUCHMAN OUTHOUSE. MORNING.\nDOCTOR: Veronica, I can’t let you do this!\nVERONICA: What?\nTOASTY: He’s right, Mum. Electrifying the loch. It’s murder. It’s wrong.\nVERONICA: The Wirrn murdered your father. They murdered Sheer!\nTOASTY: (SHOCKED) Sheer?\nDOCTOR: Yes, well, if you won’t listen to reason, Veronica — I’1l just have to undo the cables myself. (EFFORT, PULLING CABLES)\nVERONICA: You’11 never work out which is which, Doctor. Maybe they’1l try another bomb in a minute, maybe they’1ll send a team in a month. But the longer it takes, the more that loch will be melted.\nTOASTY: We’re not going to survive a month.\nVERONICA: I thought the transmat had killed you. Now that wretched transmat will kill every Wirrn in Loch Lomond. Any way you look at it, that’s justice.\nTOASTY: Please. Tell us how to find the right cables.\nVERONICA: If I do that, we have nothing. The Wirrn win.\nTOASTY: If you do this, Mum, then we have nothing. You and me.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 149\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 111. INT. NERVA CITY COUNCIL BUILDING. NIGHT.\nFLIP: It can’t be over. Except it is.\nDARE: There were children out there. Babies. This Doctor could find a way to stop it?\nFLIP: I’d bet my life.\nDARE: Not a great thing to say, just at the moment.\nFLIP: Right, look, what have we got? What do we know? There’s you and me, we seem to be safe.\nDARE: For the moment. I should watch the monitors, see if Wirrn head back.\nFLIP: Anything else we’ve got? There’s the transmat. Is there anywhere we could go?\nDARE: Everything on the network got a beacon and may well have Wirrn. The only place not on the net — oh. Oh. Hang on.\nFLIP: Where? What’s —\nDARE: The space station. It’s not got enough power to keep the transmat on all the time, if we’re lucky its pads were off when the Wirrn came. And if we’re really lucky, it’1ll be in orbit over us.\nFLIP: That would be great. We could regroup on this station, work out\nFLIP: what to do next.\nDARE: Not for another hour and twenty minutes, we can’t.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 150\nFLIP: Sorry?\nDARE: The station is about as far away in its orbit as it could be. There’s no way to transmat to it.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 151\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 112. INT. BUCHMAN OUTHOUSE. MORNING.\nDOCTOR WHO: (VERONICA, FLIP AND DOCTOR IN THE OUTHOUSE. WIRRN OUTSIDE ARE BEING A BIT QUIET. )\nVERONICA: Oh, Toasty, you just don’t get it. I would’ve said you'd understand when you’re a mother, but you’re not going to be, are you? Nobody is.\nDOCTOR: What about the Wirrn mothers?\nVERONICA: Oh, hardly the same. They’re not fighting for survival.\nDOCTOR: But they are. They have been all these years. You saw the husks, the pupae. Wirrn eggs gestate within living creatures, so where do you think they found any on a frozen loch?\nVERONICA: Nowhere. Or they wouldn’t have eaten the Nerva City crew. They wouldn’t be looking to eat us now.\nDOCTOR: Their eggs were planted back in their own mothers. Wirrn mothers giving up their lives, going through the raging agony of being eaten from within, just to give their children a chance.\nVERONICA: What about my children?\nTOASTY: I’m not a mother but I’m not a child anymore, either. Show us the right cables.\nDOCTOR: Everybody needs to grow up a little today, Veronica. The cables. Please. Before anyone transmats in.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 152\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 113. INT. NERVA CITY COUNCIL BUILDING.\nFLIP: Can you tell if the Wirrn got to the station?\nDARE: One second...\nDARE: No, they didn’t. Transmat there hasn’t been on for seven hours, which is about when Sheer transmatted down.\nFLIP: Dare... how do you know that?\nDARE: I pinged the station transmat and it replied with a status update: I’m not lying to you.\nFLIP: That’s not what I mean. You just sent a signal to the station and it replied. Why can’t we use that same system to ping Loch Lomond?\nDARE: Because Lomond rejected the last transmat which probably means the pad has been destroyed.\nFLIP: Probably but not definitely?\nDARE: Well, pretty definitely. The only other reason would be that someone stopped it. And I don’t see the Wirrn being kind.\nFLIP: So it’s not Wirrn.\nDARE: If it’s someone at all, then it’s not Wirrn, no.\nFLIP: Are you thinking who I think stopped it...?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 153\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 114: INT. BUCHMAN OUTHOUSE\nDOCTOR WHO: (F/X UNDER THE FOLLOWING, A LOW TRANSMAT HUM BEGINS: WE’RE BY THE ENGINES SO IT TAKES LONGER TO BUILD)\nTOASTY: Can you hear a humming?\nDOCTOR: It’s the transmat engine. Veronica! Show me now.\nVERONICA: Just this, all I pulled was this.\nVERONICA: (SHE SHOVES IT BACK IN. THE FRITZING STOPS — BUT THE HUM CHANGES TONE BEFORE IT COMPLETES AS NORMAL)\nTOASTY: Thanks.\nDOCTOR: By the sound of it, you were just in time. Thank you.\nVERONICA: Don’t thank me, I still think you’re wrong. Find a way to save us.\nDOCTOR: I do have an idea... But first, shush, we need to listen for what’s transmatted in.\nTOASTY: Or who.\nDOCTOR: If it were a who, we’d have heard their screams by now.\nTOASTY: I can’t hear anything.\nVERONICA: And a bomb would’ve gone off by now. No sense transmatting something over with a long fuse.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 154\nDOCTOR: So no-one transmatted in and — that transmat tone sounded different. I thought it was adjusting to the power levels but if I can find a diagnostic panel...\nDOCTOR: Now I didn’t expect that.\nTOASTY: What is it?\nVERONICA: Can it help us?\nDOCTOR: I think it can. Diagnostic says nobody transmatted in and what did arrive had only atomic mass. It was a signal.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 155\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 115. INT. NERVA CITY COUNCIL BUILDING. NIGHT.\nFLIP: Nothing. Is this even working?\nDARE: I really don’t know how to find out. I know about amplifiers but this is rerouting a signal through the space station, it’s the kind of thing you’d need someone brilliant to do. Like Sheer.\nFLIP: Or the Doctor. We need the Doctor if we’re ever to speak to the Doctor.\nDOCTOR: (D) Doctor calling Nerva City. Come in, please.\nFLIP: (LAUGHS WITH RELIEF) How do I answer?\nDOCTOR: (D) Can anyone hear me?\nDARE: Press there.\nFLIP: (INTO RADIO) Doctor!\nDOCTOR: (D) Flip! Excellent. I expect you missed me.\nFLIP: (INTO RADIO) Barely noticed you were gone. Doctor, I know about Sheer. How are Toasty and Veronica? And Roger?\nDARE: Oh, we really didn’t need that. Flip, the Wirrn are coming back\nDARE: to the building. Must’ve detected us using the equipment.\nFLIP: Gotcha. I’1ll talk faster. Doctor?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 156\nDOCTOR: (D) I said, the good news is that Toasty and Veronica are getting on better than ever.\nFLIP: (INTO RADIO) Oh. I can guess the bad, then.\nDOCTOR: (D) I’m afraid so. But what about you? I saw the blood on the microlite.\nFLIP: (INTO RADIO) Don’t mind me, Doctor. They patched me up here. Did you get my message? Did it help? Can we do anything? Time’s a bit pressing.\nDOCTOR: (D) It’s not exactly dragging for me, either. I’ve wired some temporary controls into the transmat engines here, but I need some specialist knowledge. Do you have any transmat scientists there?\nFLIP: (INTO RADIO) No.\nDARE: (INTO RADIO) Doctor, I’m Dare, can I help? I’m the best we’ve got.\nDOCTOR: (D) Are you high-ranking on the council?\nDARE: No ranking at all, but I still went to more sessions than my boss did.\nDOCTOR: (D) I’m going to break your transmat network but then I’1l need every access code there is to restart it properly. Can you help me?\nFLIP: Dare, trust him. There’s no one else left to trust.\nDARE: I trust you.\nFLIP: Then I’m asking you. Please.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 157\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 116. INT. BUCHMAN OUTHOUSE. MORNING.\nDOCTOR: At last, the codes. Everything’s unlocking. Oh.\nVERONICA: Can you do what you’ve got to do before the Wirrn get in?\nDOCTOR: No. I can’t. I can’t do it from here at all.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 158\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 117. INT. NERVA CITY COUNCIL BUILDING. NIGHT.\nDOCTOR WHO: ALARM 1:\nDOCTOR WHO: Intruder in council lobby. Response teams will soon report to\nDOCTOR WHO: council lobby.\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX ANOTHER CRASH, MUCH CLOSER: WIRRN ARE SOON TO ENTER THE ROOM. )\nDARE: The Wirrn, they’re coming. What’s taking your Doctor so long?\nFLIP: Let’s go ask him, eh?\nDARE: What? How do we know it’s safe?\nFLIP: Here won’t be safe in a minute.\nDARE: OK. Quick, get on the pad.\nFLIP: I’m not going without you, Dare.\nDARE: Takes longer to set the timer. Just choosing the Loch Lomond coordinates, I’ll send you on and then follow in a second.\nFLIP: Wirrn. Dare!\nDARE: Ignore them, I’m almost —\nDARE: (F/X THE TRANSMAT HUM BUILDS UP — BUT FLIP JUMPS OFF THE PAD BEFORE SHE’S PORTED AWAY. )\nDARE: What are you doing? Get back on the pad!\nFLIP: All for one, one for all. Set the timer!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 159\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 118. INT. BUCHMAN OUTHOUSE. MORNING.\nTOASTY: I thought you could control the transmat from here, from the engines?\nDOCTOR: So did I. But it seems all I can do is patch into the network.\nVERONICA: So that’s it, we’re sunk?\nDOCTOR: We have to get back to the pad. I need the full controls there.\nTOASTY: But the house, it’s riddled with Wirrn.\nDOCTOR: I know.\nTOASTY: We’ll never get past them!\nVERONICA: Then they can take me, while you two get to the pad.\nTOASTY: Mum!\nVERONICA: I’m not losing you again, Toasty.\nDOCTOR: We do what we must. Come on!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 160\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 119. INT. BUCHMAN TRANSMAT ROOM. MORNING\nDOCTOR WHO: (ANGRY CHIRRUPING, FEROCIOUS SCUTTLING FROM TWO WIRRN IN THE ROOM. AND THEN A TRANSMAT HUM)\nFLIP: [God,] that was close — DARE, BEHIND YOU!!!\nFLIP: (WIRRN MANDIBLES FLICK OUT TOWARD THEM. DARE FIRES FISSION GUN TWICE. WIRRN SQUEALING, INJURED)\nDARE: My lights, these guns kick back-!\nFLIP: That one’s still alive. Dare-!\nDARE: tes all wight; 11) finish at-=\nDOCTOR: (RUSHING IN) No you will not!\nFLIP: Doctor-!!!\nDOCTOR: Tell your trigger-happy friend, the Wirrn are intelligent. All she needs to do is warn them off.\nDARE: Warn them off-?\nDOCTOR: Show her, Veronica —\nDARE: Hey! Give that back-!\nVERONICA: Like this. (FX: DISCHARGES GUN INTO AIR, TWICE.) Go. Go!!!\nDOCTOR: Of course, being intelligent, they’re not stupid. They’1ll know\nDOCTOR: the power cells will run dry soon enough.\nVERONICA: So-?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 161\nDOCTOR: So use the charge sparingly.\nVERONICA: Unnerstan.\nVERONICA: (VERONICA FIRES AFTER WIRRN: CHIRRUPING-WIMPERING. DURING THE FOLLOWING, HE FIRES AT INTERVALS. )\nDOCTOR: Good to see you, Flip.\nFLIP: Still blummen’ cold here, Doctor. Bet you’ve lost my coat.\nDOCTOR: Ah, yes, I think I have.\nFLIP: Typical. Doctor, this is Dare.\nDARE: Hello. And I’ve met you before, Toasty. Hi.\nTOASTY: It was in better circumstances, I think.\nVERONICA: So you’re this Dare woman.\nVERONICA: Just keeping the Wirrn at bay.\nDARE: Right. Doctor, I’ve got to warn you, there’s no going back to Nerva City. Wirrn have transmatted in everywhere.\nDOCTOR: I have an idea about that. Best you get off the pad.\nDOCTOR: Veronica, stop firing.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 162\nDOCTOR: Roger was looking for Iron’s DNA in the Wirrn but that means he beamed in Wirrn DNA too. Which I can now use to lock onto our friend here and —\nDOCTOR: - he’s gone. Out somewhere on the loch.\nFLIP: Two Wirrn down, countless more to go.\nDOCTOR: Watch out!\nDOCTOR: (VERONICA FIRES AT THE ONE WIRRN COMING IN — AND IT YELPS. IT’S AN IRON/WIRRN. )\nDOCTOR: IRON/WIRRN: Mum, it’s only me.\nTOASTY: Iron? You’re Iron?\nVERONICA: (COLLAPSING) I can’t take this.\nDARE: Hold on to me.\nDARE: TRON/WIRRN-SHEER/WIRRN: (CHIRRUP-LAUGHS) The two girlfriends together. (TO FLIP) And you, Flip, you said countless more Wirrn?\nFLIP: What if I did?\nFLIP: IRON/WIRRN: Then I did beam out across the world. Magical. Disappear here, reappear everywhere. All at once.\nDOCTOR: There was no need for this carnage.\nDOCTOR: ITRON/WIRRN: I was one Wirrn against a city. I think those are fair odds.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 163\nDOCTOR: Will you call the rest of the Wirrn back here? You could form a colony.\nDOCTOR: TRON/WIRRN-SHEER/WIRRN:\nDOCTOR: Why make a colony when we can have a planet? I own Earth, Doctor. (IN SHEER’S VOICE) It will remain the Wirrn breeding ground.\nVERONICA: Please, Iron. This isn’t you.\nDARE: Nor is it Sheer.\nDOCTOR: I won’t allow it.\nDOCTOR: IRON/WIRRN: It’s already done. Do you imagine you can do anything?\nDOCTOR: Well... I can tell you that I’m sorry.\nVERONICA: That’s it? You’re sorry? I’ve lost Sheer and Roger and you are sorry?\nVERONICA: ITRON/WIRRN: What about me, Mum?\nDOCTOR: What I mean is that I am sorry for you, Iron. I really am.\nDOCTOR: (HE WORKS THE TRANSMAT; THERE’S AN EXTENDED, SUSTAINED HUM BUT IRON/WIRRN DOESN’T GO ANYWHERE)\nDOCTOR: IRON/WIRRN: (CHIRRUP LAUGH) How many times will you try to transmat me out to the loch?\nDOCTOR: That’s not what I’m doing.\nDARE: Veronica, give me back my gun.\nDARE: IRON/WIRRN: Move to Dare and I’11 kill you, Mum.\nTOASTY: Iron! No!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 164\nFLIP: (HUSHED) Doctor? What are you doing?\nDOCTOR: I’m melting Loch Lomond.\nTOASTY: The loch? The ice-filled loch?\nDARE: You can’t do that, can you?\nDARE: IRON/WIRRN: Why should I care about the loch? This foul place, you can have it. I’1ll never again be trapped here.\nDOCTOR: Yes, well, we should have a chat about that.\nDOCTOR: It’s done. I locked onto the molecules and shook them up. The water is now about 20 degrees Celsius. Last chance, Iron.\nDOCTOR: IRON/WIRRN: Burn the water. Boil it. What is that to me?\nDOCTOR: Remember you said it.\nDOCTOR: But remember, too, that I would never boil a living creature. Not one, not all. Not you, Iron, and not every Wirrn in Nerva Cry.\nDOCTOR: (TRANSMAT HUM RISES — THERE’S A BANG OF A RELAY BUT IT KEEPS RISING)\nVERONICA: You’re overloading the transmat! You’1ll destroy it and we’1ll be stuck here.\nDARE: There’s nowhere else we can go.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 165\nTOASTY: Doctor, how will this help stop the Wirrn?\nFLIP: If it does, I’m up for it whatever happens to us.\nDOCTOR: I do believe you are, Flip. Yes.\nDOCTOR: IRON/WIRRN: Overload the transmat, boil the loch, this is nothing, I should kill you all where you stand.\nDOCTOR: I should’ve done it when you came in then. Transmatting now.\nFLIP: What’s happened?\nDOCTOR: I’ve been immensely clever. Do you want to know how, Iron?\nDOCTOR: IRON/WIRRN: Enjoy your last word, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: No, no, everybody, just stay where you were. Everything is fine. The Wirrn threat is over.\nDOCTOR: IRON/WIRRN: It will never be over.\nDOCTOR: You beamed copies of yourself out via the transmat network. Every copy of you sent the same way — and every copy still in range of a pad. I’ve just beamed every Wirrn into the loch.\nDARE: That will have broken the network backbone.\nDOCTOR: Yes, sorry about that. Still, I’ve kept the line open from here to Nerva City.\nVERONICA: So why’s he still here?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 166\nFLIP: Because you need to listen to the Doctor, Iron.\nDOCTOR: You’re next, Iron. I’m beaming you out to the loch and then I am freezing it again. It’ll be down to Nerva City to decide what to do with you and up to you how you negotiate peace.\nDOCTOR: IRON/WIRRN: What possible reason can there be for peace?\nDOCTOR: I’ve beamed out the Wirrn. I’ve not beamed out the eggs they’ve laid. Both sides will have to talk. Just not now.\nVERONICA: Goodbye, son.\nTOASTY: Bye, Iron.\nTOASTY: TRON/WIRRN: I’m coming back. Mother! Doctor! I’m [coming back-!!!]\nFLIP: Is it really over?\nTOASTY: Every Wirrn gone?\nTOASTY: (TRANSMAT HUM REPEATS; THE SAME SUSTAIN AS WHEN THE DOCTOR MELTED THE LOCH)\nDOCTOR: Just freezing the loch... Yes, it’s over, Flip. But no, Toasty, not quite all. Leaving the eggs means I’ve also left any husks that are around the island. So I suggest we leave Inchfad isle to whatever Wirrn are still here.\nDARE: And go home. Going to be a lot to do.\nTOASTY: Mum and I will be there to help. Won’t we, Mum?\nVERONICA: We will, Toasty.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 167\nDOCTOR: All of you, onto the pad.\nDOCTOR: Not you, Flip. Time we had a talk.\nDARE: But you are coming back with us?\nDOCTOR: We’ll be just a moment. But it’s time for you to go.\nVERONICA: Thanks, Doctor.\nTOASTY: Yes, thanks —\nFLIP: We’re not going to see them again, are we?\nDOCTOR: No. I’m resetting the co-ordinates for the transmat pad we first used. Nearer the TARDIS.\nFLIP: Right. Uh, before we go...\nDOCTOR: Yes?\nFLIP: We’ve done all right together, haven’t we? Daleks, the Porcians. Wirrn.\nDOCTOR: You’ve been extraordinarily brave, yes... if a little reckless. I always take it upon myself to protect those who travel with me. But in your case, that’s proving to be something of an overly stressful task.\nFLIP: (A LITTLE CRUSHED) Oh... Oh, I see. So, you mean you’ve had enough of—\nDOCTOR: Flip, what I’m trying to say is —\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 168\nFLIP: . that I’m a liability? Listen, Doctor, I’m not thick. I can see you’ve got break-up eyes. But the thing is, I do want to stay with you!\nDOCTOR: Flip—\nFLIP: No, no, it’s all right. I can take it. I understand. I just... just wanna say thank you. And sorry, actually, sorry for lumbering you with me. I’ve been more scared than I ever imagined but I also wouldn’t have missed this. And you gave me the chance to help people. I won’t forget that. I won’t forget you... Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Let’s get you home, Flip.\nFLIP: Right. Yes. Of course. London. That’s fine.\nDOCTOR: Not London.\nFLIP: Eh?\nDOCTOR: The TARDIS.\nFLIP: YES!\nFLIP: Set that timer, Doctor, we’ve got places to be.\nDOCTOR: Just one thing.\nFLIP: Anything. Name it.\nDOCTOR: Please, promise me you’1l be more careful in future?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE PRODIGAL WIRRN by William Gallagher (003-AB) Page 169\nFLIP: Definitely\nDOCTOR: Good.\nFLIP: Definitely give it a try.\nDOCTOR: Hmm... I see.\nCRASH IN CLOSING THEME: END OF EPISODE AND SERIAL"
