Except Mrs Kniddel.\nHARRY: Don’t embarrass her, Ludo.\nSWAPNIL: I’1ll just put an “I” here.\nHARRY: I-D? No initials, you said.\nLUDO: Id, Harry.

And it’s Mrs. Thanks to a man from the Herne Hill velodrome.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 8\nDOCTOR: Oh yes?\nQUEENIE: Yes, well, it’s a sorry story. We went to Hastings for the honeymoon. He abandoned me on the esplanade. Just cycled off.\nDOCTOR: The blackguard.\nQUEENIE: . With his waxed moustache and his Sturmey-Archer internal gear hub...\nDOCTOR: (STILL SEARCHING HIS POCKETS) A blackguard’s gear hub...\nQUEENIE: Some girl on the team told me he was married already.\nDOCTOR: Who to?\nQUEENIE: To whom? To the woman who works the comptometer at Liptons. Currant eyes and a face like a smacked bottom.\nDOCTOR: Sounds like a lucky escape. (FX: SEARCHING HIS POCKETS) Oh, look, I’ve found a liquorice allsort.\nQUEENIE: Anyway, Daddy said he was a rotter. Daddy always knows.\nDOCTOR: He does?\nQUEENIE: Oh yes. Daddy’s always one step ahead of the other player.\nDOCTOR: It’s the best place to be, if you don’t want to be checkmated. (HE’S FOUND SOMETHING ELSE IN HIS POCKET) Aha!

Is this a laundry list?\nQUEENIE: (READS) Doctor. Beige jacket. Tank top. Question mark umbrella.\nDOCTOR: Clearly me, isn’t it?\nQUEENIE: Yes. Should you be worried?\nDOCTOR: Up to a point. I’ve had amnesia before.\nQUEENIE: And how did you get over it then?\nDOCTOR: I really can’t [remember ]\nQUEENIE: (INTERRUPTING) Well of course you can’t.\nDOCTOR: But I don’t think we ought to let that concern us. I’1l behave as if I remember exactly why I’m on my way to a sanatoriun ...\nQUEENIE: Hahlbruck sanatorium...\nDOCTOR: And all the details will come flooding back.\nQUEENIE: I must say you’re taking all this very well.\nDOCTOR: When your consciousness has been jiggered about with as much as mine, you learn to...\nQUEENIE: Adapt?\nDOCTOR: Probably. Funny thing is... Switzerland. Now I know I’m suffering from memory loss, but that seems wrong to me.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 13\nQUEENIE: What do you mean?\nDOCTOR: Well, whoever I am, I’m not the sort of person who says, ‘let’s go to Switzerland.’ It just sounds wrong coming out of my mouth.\nQUEENIE: It does?\nDOCTOR: ‘I say, how about a trip to Vevey?’ ‘Oh! The cantons are so lovely at this time of year!’ ‘I do love the cheese with the\nDOCTOR: holes!’ It’s just not very me, is it?\nQUEENIE: Well...\nDOCTOR: I mean, do you believe I like that sort of thing? Vevey? Cantons? I mean, do you? I didn’t even know the name of this place.\nQUEENIE: Hahlbruck. And here we are. There’s the cable car station. And there, up above it...\nDOCTOR: What’s so extraordinary about Hahlbruck sanatorium?\nQUEENIE: Well, it’s the finest recuperative centre in Davos. Tip-top for anything pulmonary.\nDOCTOR: Never heard of it.\nQUEENIE: Oh it’s famous. If you need to expectorate into a kidney dish, then Hahlbruck is the place to do it. It’s good for ennui, too. Or it used to be. Back in the good old days.\nDOCTOR: Oh yes? What happened?\nQUEENIE: Something involving the medical director and several thousand volts.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 14\nDOCTOR: Sounds more like a kill than a cure.\nQUEENIE: It snuffed out Dr Black like a thrupenny candle. I think business has been a little depressed since.\nDOCTOR: Like the patients?\nQUEENIE: Like the ones that were left behind.\nDOCTOR: Well that’s something, anyway. Something promising. An unexplained death on the top of a mountain. Something for me to get my teeth into...\nDOCTOR: (FX: THE CLUNK OF THE CABLE CAR ARRIVING AT ITS STOPPING POINT. THEN SILENCE. )\nQUEENIE: This is us.\nDOCTOR: Yes. And only us.\nQUEENIE: That’s very frustrating. No chap to open the door.\nDOCTOR: No chap to do anything. Allow me.\nDOCTOR: (FX: THE WINDOW IS ROLLED DOWN, THE DOCTOR STICKS HIS ARM THROUGH AND OPENS THE DOOR WITH THE OUTSIDE HANDLE. )\nDOCTOR: There. Who stopped the mechanism, do you think?\nQUEENIE: It must work by itself. (FX: SHE’S GATHERING UP HER LUGGAGE. ) Bring that hatbox, would you?\nDOCTOR: Yes, Mrs Glasscock. (FX: THE DOCTOR PULLS DOWN THE HATBOX. )\nQUEENIE: (CLAMBERING DOWN TO THE WOODEN PLATFORM) Watch the step.\nQUEENIE: (FX: THE GEARS SUDDENLY START UP AGAIN AND THE CARS ARE ALL IN\nMOTION: ONCE MORE. )\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 15\nDOCTOR: Whoa-!\nQUEENIE: Mind-! They don’t give you much time to get out, do they?\nDOCTOR: No. Which is odd. As we’re the only passengers.\nQUEENIE: Eh?\nDOCTOR: Look. Now our car has shifted you can see right down the cable. And all the other cars...\nQUEENIE: They’re empty. Quite empty.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 16\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 5: INT. GAMES ROOM\nLUDO: No shortage of chairs. But will this work with three people?\nHARRY: Let’s give it a try, Ludo.\nLUDO: Right-ho. Down goes the needle.\nLUDO: (FX: A SONG TINKLES FROM THE GRAMOPHONE, THEN STOPS SUDDENLY. THERE’S A KERFUFFLE. THE NOISE OF EVERYONE SCRABBLING FOR A CHAIR. )\nHARRY: Cor, Mrs Kniddel, you’ve got elbows on you, aintcha?\nSWAPNIL: Fair and square, Harry. You’re out.\nHARRY: Musical statues is more my forte.\nLUDO: Take away another chair. (FX: CHAIR SCRAPE) And off we go!\nLUDO: (FX: THE MUSIC STARTS AGAIN.

I wonder if...\nLUDO: Why don’t you answer it?\nHARRY: Oh no. I know that trick. Electrified door handle. Me on the hall carpet, spitting foam. No thank you, matey.\nLUDO: Don’t be absurd, Harry. The door handle isn’t electrified. What rot.\nLUDO: (FX: THE DISTANT SOUND OF THE DOCTOR RECEIVING A POWERFUL\nELECTRIC: SHOCK.

Them upstairs?\nSWAPNIL: You’re right, Harry. Permit me. Pip-pip.\nLUDO: So we have a winner. Mrs Kniddel. Again!\nHARRY: And there’s a prize.\nLUDO: Oh yes. A little tin of biscuits.\nHARRY: You’1ll share them, won’t you, Mrs K?\nLUDO: Page 17\nLUDO: Capital. And when we’ve all had one, we can administer first\nLUDO: aid to our guests. Let’s have some music, shall we?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 18\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 6: INT.

Have you?\nSWAPNIL: And is that good or bad? It’s so difficult to remember the rules. Well if you have any special instructions, just write them on a piece of paper and slide it under the [door]\nSWAPNIL: . Oh, you have. (PICKS IT UP) Beige jacket. Tank top. Question mark umbrella.

I’1ll see what I can do.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 19\nSWAPNIL: Though I feel obliged to inform you that there is no Q in electrocute.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 20\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 7: EXT.

Look after him, then.\nLUDO: Of course.\nQUEENIE: And you — are you any good at carrying things?\nHARRY: Not bad.\nQUEENIE: You can take my luggage inside then.\nQUEENIE: Let’s get him in, too, shall we?\nLUDO: Oh yes. There’s a cosy ottoman in the hallway.\nHARRY: What happened to him?\nQUEENIE: It was an electric shock.\nLUDO: Here we are. Let’s have that cushion, Harry. And shut the door, too, there’s a good chap.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 21\nLUDO: Some kind of static charge must have built up in the ether.\nQUEENIE: Ether? Fiddlesticks. There’s just something wrong with the wiring. And it’s hard to believe that it wasn’t done on purpose.\nLUDO: Oh really, Miss...\nQUEENIE: Glasscock.\nDOCTOR: (REVIVING) And it’s Mrs.\nLUDO: Oh. Hello. Feeling better, are we?\nDOCTOR: (JUMPING TO HIS FEET) Actually I feel rather better than I did an hour ago.\nLUDO: A side effect of the shock, perhaps.\nDOCTOR: I’ve had one of my funny turns, do you see? Except that I don’t really have funny turns. So I suppose I must have had one of somebody’s else’s funny turns. Wasn’t one of yours, was it?\nLUDO: Certainly not.\nSWAPNIL: Queenie!\nQUEENIE: Daddy! Daddy! My Daddy!\nSWAPNIL: Oh Queenie, it’s so marvellous to see you. I thought once you were married...\nQUEENIE: So did I. But then I went to Hastings.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 22\nSWAPNIL: What happened in Hastings, my little humdum?\nQUEENIE: The train was on time. The hotel was lovely. The towels were terribly soft.\nSWAPNIL: And the weather?\nQUEENIE: It held out all week. Which is more than you can say for the marriage.\nSWAPNIL: So this isn’t your husband?\nDOCTOR: I’m no blackguard.\nQUEENIE: No, this is the Doctor. He’s here for amnesia.\nLUDO: I’ll be the judge of that.\nDOCTOR: Oh? And who are you, exactly?\nLUDO: I’m the deputy medical director. Ludovic Comfort. Director, Since the sad loss of Dr Black.\nSWAPNIL: Ludo, you’re a grim old stick. Doctor, my name is Swapnil Khan. You've already met my daughter. And the man holding the hatbox is Mr Harry Randall.\nDOCTOR: Pleased to meet you, Mr Randall.\nSWAPNIL: Harry topped the bill at the Penge Empire. But then...\nHARRY: The war, you know.\nDOCTOR: I quite understand.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 23\nLUDO: And here’s our fourth for bridge.\nSWAPNIL: Mrs Elsa Kniddel, our resident pianist.\nDOCTOR: How do you do?\nSWAPNIL: (SOTTO) Mrs Kniddel has not spoken since an undisclosed incident in a rowing boat on Lake Balaton in the summer of 1919. But I assure you that she comprehends all.\nDOCTOR: I’m sure that you do, Mrs Kniddel. Are you the only patients here?\nSWAPNIL: Almost. Unless you count the pair in the isolation ward. But they were brought in.. when was it, Harry?\nHARRY: A month ago, was it? Sorry. I feel a bit odd.\nSWAPNIL: Put that hatbox down and have a seat, Harry. (FX: HARRY SITS DOWN) Tuesday week. And nobody’s seen hide nor hair of them. I suppose it must be something contagious.\nLUDO: They simply need rest, that’s all.\nDOCTOR: Where is the isolation ward?\nSWAPNIL: In the attic.\nDOCTOR: Of course it is.\nLUDO: Actually it’s time I looked in on them. Would you excuse me?\nQUEENIE: Of course, Director.\nDOCTOR: Well, that’s that, then. Case almost closed.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 24\nQUEENIE: What do you mean?\nQUEENIE: (FX: HARRY MAKES AN ODD GULPING SOUND. HIS DISCOMFORT INCREASES. )\nDOCTOR: These new patients hold the key to what’s happening here. Mysterious people in attics always do. I’d bet my hat on it.\nSWAPNIL: You don’t have a hat.\nDOCTOR: No. So apart from my missing hat, that leaves just one more mystery to solve.\nQUEENIE: Which is?\nDOCTOR: What’s the trouble with Harry?\nDOCTOR: (FX: HARRY SUFFERS A VIOLENT CONVULSION AND CRUMPLES TO THE FLOOR, FITTING. )\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 25\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 8: INT.

There is an axe here, you know.\nLUDO: (FX: THE DOOR SWISHES OPEN. THE SOUND FROM INSIDE BECOMES LOUDER. )\nLUDO: Thank you. I hope you’ve got a drink ready for me —\nSWAPNIL: (OFF) Ludo! Ludo!\nLUDO: (SOTTO) What is it now? (TO SWAPNIL) Just a moment!\nSWAPNIL: (NEARLY ARRIVED) It’s an emergency, Ludo!\nLUDO: (TO THE OCCUPANTS OF THE ATTIC) Well shut the door, then. Do you want him to see you?\nSWAPNIL: (ARRIVING) Ludo, it’s Harry. He needs your help.\nLUDO: The usual, I suppose.\nSWAPNIL: Did you have that door open?\nLUDO: Don’t be preposterous, Swapnil. That would be an entirely illegal move.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 26\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 9: INT. HALLWAY\nDOCTOR: Loosen his tie. (FX: TIE UNLOOSENED.) And throw me that cushion, Mrs Kniddel.\nQUEENIE: Would some soup be any use?\nDOCTOR: Yes, if the object was to choke him to death.\nQUEENIE: So what’s wrong with him?

We have more visitors on the way. Go, on, look. There’s a magnificent view from the balcony.\nSWAPNIL: (FX: OPENING THE FRENCH WINDOWS TO THE BALCONY.) Come out and look, Doctor. He’s right.\nDOCTOR: (JOINING HIM) About what?\nSWAPNIL: That little line of lights. The cable car is moving again.\nQUEENIE: I wonder who it is.\nDOCTOR: Mr Khan, where has the director taken Harry?\nSWAPNIL: To the treatment room, of course.\nDOCTOR: But what kind of treatment will he receive?\nSWAPNIL: About three hundred volts I believe.\nDOCTOR: What?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 28\nSWAPNIL: Or four hundred.

TREATMENT ROOM\nLUDO: Alright Mrs Kniddel. Tighten the straps, would you?\nHARRY: It’s no good, Ludo. I remember him. Beige jacket! Question mark umbrella! He comes here every day and by teatime he’s forgotten it all. But I’1ll keep remembering him. No matter what you do to me.\nLUDO: I’d give the old jaw a rest, if I were you.\nHARRY: And the TARDIS, too. The TARDIS! The peeling paint and the flashing light!\nLUDO: The bone, Mrs Kniddel. Bite on that, please, Harry.\nLUDO: (FX: THE BONE IS STUFFED INTO HARRY’S MOUTH. LUDO POWERS UP THE MACHINE. )\nLUDO: Stand back from the table, Mrs Kniddel.\nHARRY: And there was another man, too.

Looks a bit like... one of those things you use to check the pressure in tyres...\nLUDO: Doctor — you have no idea what you’ve done, have you?\nDOCTOR: I simply made a medical intervention.\nHARRY: (IN SHOCK) I say I say I Say...\nLUDO: You’ve destroyed our one hope of survival.\nDOCTOR: Don’t be ridiculous.\nHARRY: Where do sick bees go?\nDOCTOR: I haven’t done anything of the kind.\nHARRY: I don’t know, where do sick bees go?\nDOCTOR: All I did was prevent you causing irreparable damage to your patient’s brain.\nHARRY: To the wasp-ital.\nLUDO: This is quite beyond repair.\nDOCTOR: That was the idea.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 31\nHARRY: My mother in law is a wooden shoe woman. Wooden shoe like to lend me this, wooden shoe like to lend me that?\nLUDO: You just don’t know when to stop, do you? You just don’t know when to let things alone.\nDOCTOR: Perhaps I haven’t stopped yet. I may have lost my grip on precisely who I am, but saving people from electrocution — that feels very me. So does — oh, let me think — going up to the attic, perhaps?\nLUDO: No, Doctor. I can’t let you do that.\nDOCTOR: Try stopping me!\nHARRY: Met my wife in the tunnel of love. She was digging it.\nLUDO: Mrs Kniddel. Go to my study and fetch a phial of number 78 and a cloth. Now, please.\nHARRY: You’ve been a lovely audience.

But how can we stop him this time?\nHERBERT: We've done it before. Cable car. Sanatorium. Electricity. You know how it goes.\nLOLA: Yes, but every round gets trickier and trickier. And nobody roots for us. They all love him so much.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 33\nHERBERT: Who’s welcomed warmly everywhere? By stalwart men and ladies fair?

The contagion.\nDOCTOR: I’m working on the right door, I hope. What I want is behind here, isn’t it?\nLUDO: You’ve already done so much damage.\nDOCTOR: Mysteries must be solved.

That’s a funny sort of name, isn’t it? It’s a little comic.\nACE: [AS BUNTY] If you say so, old man.\nDOCTOR: I do, old man. And what’s his name?\nACE: [AS BUNTY] He’s Bobo.\nDOCTOR: Bobo? Bobo and Bunty? (LAUGHS UPROARIOUSLY. )\nACE: [AS BUNTY] I think you’re beastly to laugh. We’re not very well, do you see? That’s why we’re up here in the isolation ward.\nLUDO: (FROM OUTSIDE THE DOOR) Hello in there!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 37\nHEX: [AS BOBO] Yes, we’re sick. Very sick.\nDOCTOR: There’s a doctor out there who wants your attention. Unless you’d prefer a second opinion from me.\nLUDO: (OUTSIDE) Hello! Just to say that if you’d like me to help you out, I am equipped. Mrs Kniddel’s with me too.\nACE: [AS BUNTY] Alright, let him in.\nHEX: [AS BOBO] What about Mrs Kniddel?\nACE: [AS BUNTY] Her too.\nHEX: [AS BOBO] Are you sure about that?\nACE: [AS BUNTY] I think we can trust her to keep a secret.\nLUDO: Thank you. Everything tickety-boo in here? You look as if you’ve reached a kind of social impasse.\nACE: [AS BUNTY] Get us out of it then, Ludo.\nLUDO: [AS BOBO] Doctor, may I present the Honourable Mr Stetterton and his wife Bunty.\nDOCTOR: Stetterton! This gets better and better.\nHEX: [AS BOBO] Shush. Not so loud. We’re not really here. We don’t want to be all over the gossip magazines.\nLUDO: That’s why they’re in the attic, Doctor. Far away from the prying eyes of the Tatler and the Bystander.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 38\nDOCTOR: Now this is all very odd. I never read the Tatler unless I’m at the dentist. And I’ve not been to the dentist since 1881. What year is it now?\nACE: [AS BUNTY] 1926.\nDOCTOR: Well that’s that. But you know, I’m sure I’ve heard those names before. Bunty and Bobo Stetterton. And I know your faces, too. But your faces and your names don’t go together. You’re not who you think you are.\nHEX: [AS BOBO] We’re not who we think we are?\nDOCTOR: Perhaps I’m not who I think I am. Perhaps none of us is. Or perhaps you don’t really think you are who you say you are. Perhaps... (A MOMENT OF SURPRISE AS LUDO MUFFLES HIS MOUTH WITH A CHLOROFORM-SOAKED RAG.) (MUFFLED BY LUDO) .. that smells like chloroform on your handkerchiet...\nHEX: [AS BOBO] I’m sorry?\nDOCTOR: (CLEAR AGAIN) I said, that smells like chloroform on your handkerchief, Ludo.\nLUDO: Yes, it is.\nDOCTOR: Now, what was I saying? Oh yes — where have my knees gone?\nACE: (BACK TO HER NORMAL SELF) Cheers, Ludo. I thought he’d never stop.\nLUDO: Usually he struggles more than that.\nHEX: (ALSO BACK TO NORMAL) We can’t keep doing this to him. His biochemistry isn’t like ours. It’s not having the right effect.\nLUDO: It’s that or nothing, now. He’s destroyed the ECT machine.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 39\nACE: It’s just one more night and one more day, Ludo.\nLUDO: That’1l be Lola and the other Randall twin.\nHEX: Midnight tomorrow and we’1ll all be back home in our own beds.\nLUDO: I hope you’re right.\nACE: We are, Ludo. I promise you, mate, it’1ll all look better by breakfast.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 40\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 14: INT. BREAKFAST ROOM\nLOLA: Good morning, Herbert. How did you sleep?\nHERBERT: Well I just put my head down on the pillow and shut my eyes.\nLOLA: Me too, meine honigblenchen.\nHERBERT: This would be the breakfast room, I suppose?\nLOLA: The presence of breakfast would suggest so.\nHERBERT: Marvellous spread, innit? What do you fancy?\nLOLA: See what the boys in the backroom will have, and tell them I’m having the same.\nHERBERT: That’1ll be a cup of coffee, then, will it?\nLOLA: Jah, bitte.\nSWAPNIL: (ARRIVING) Good morning!\nLOLA: (SOTTO) The chess player.\nSWAPNIL: You must be the new arrivals. Who sorted you out last night?\nLOLA: The director. And a big-boned taciturn Hungarian lady with a leather eye patch.\nSWAPNIL: Mrs Kniddel.\nLOLA: That’s the bird.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 41\nHERBERT: We should introduce ourselves.\nSWAPNIL: Well we know who you are. You’re the spit of him. Herbert Randall, I presume? Harry’s brother? The other half of the Randall Twins, the serio-comic funambulists?\nHERBERT: On the nose. Where is he, by the way?\nSWAPNIL: Harry? In his room. He had a rough old night of it.\nLOLA: Take him up some breakfast, Harry. Here.(PILING FOOD ON TO A PLATE.) Bacon, chanterelles — and how do you call this?\nSWAPNIL: Bubble and squeak.\nLOLA: Jah, bubble und squeak.\nSWAPNIL: And you, madam, are?\nHERBERT: This is Miss Lola Luna. Doyenne of the Weimar cabaret circuit. You ain’t nobody in Berlin until she’s stuck a fishnet leg on your table in the whisky bar and barked something seductive into your earhole. She don’t sing quite so often, now though, owing to the pneumothoracic tube poking out of her chest.\nLOLA: Ach, nein, it is nothing. A little pipe to ease the pressure on my lungs. That is all. On a good day I can whistle a tune through it. (SHE WHISTLES.) Intriguing, no?\nSWAPNIL: Even so, I’m terribly sorry to hear you’ve been unwell, Miss Luna.\nLOLA: Oh, drop it, Swapnil. You know perfectly well who I am. It’s only the Doctor who doesn’t know. Where is he, by the way?\nSWAPNIL: He’s sleeping something off, too, I believe.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 42\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 15: INT. DOCTOR’S ROOM\nQUEENIE: (FROM OUTSIDE) Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Hmm?\nQUEENIE: (FROM OUTSIDE) Are you decent?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know.\nQUEENIE: Question-mark pyjamas, eh? Are they yours?\nDOCTOR: Never seen them before in my life.\nQUEENIE: Well consider yourself fortunate. They didn’t supply me with anything. And the noise kept me up all night.\nDOCTOR: What noise?\nQUEENIE: Rats, I imagine. How do you feel?\nDOCTOR: Some of the cobwebs have been blown away.\nQUEENIE: You’re seeing things more clearly, then?\nDOCTOR: I get knocked down, but I get up again. And every time they knock me down — I feel a little stronger. And I know a little more.\nDOCTOR: (FX: A SCUFFLE FROM BEHIND THE WAINSCOT. A WOODEN VENTRILOQUIST’S DUMMY IS SCUTTERING THROUGH THE WALLSPACE. )\nQUEENIE: That noise again.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 43\nDOCTOR: (SCEPTICAL) Rats in the wainscot, you say?\nQUEENIE: I admit, it sounds like something [bigger —]\nLUDO: (OUTSIDE THE DOOR) Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Just a moment!\nLUDO: (OUTSIDE) Time to get up, now.\nQUEENIE: I’1l hide under the bed.\nDOCTOR: I don’t think that’s a very good [idea]\nDOCTOR: Morning.\nLUDO: Feeling yourself, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Much better, Doctor... what is your name again?\nLUDO: Ludovic Comfort. I’m...\nDOCTOR: I know who you are. You’re the man who stepped into Dr Black’s shoes. While they were still sizzling.\nDOCTOR: Breakfast. Excellent. I could eat your weight in muesli.\nLUDO: Breakfast was hours ago, Doctor. You’re being summoned for the morning run.\nDOCTOR: The morning what?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 44\nLUDO: A constitutional perambulation around the girdle of the mountain. Something to get the old ticker pounding.\nDOCTOR: Is it obligatory?\nLUDO: For patients, yes. I’ve brought your running shoes. Mind the spikes as you put them on. Oh, I’ve brought a pair for you, too, Mrs Glasscock. Shall I just slide them under the bed?\nQUEENIE: (FROM UNDER THE BED) Much obliged, director.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 45\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 16: INT. HARRY’S ROOM\nHERBERT: Harry? I’ve some breakfast for you, old fellow.\nHARRY: There once was a bishop of Birmingham, who — err...\nHERBERT: Shall I put it on your bedside table?\nHARRY: What did he do, that bishop of Birmingham?\nHERBERT: We had the Purity League down on us when you recited that at the Bradford Alhambra.\nHARRY: Why am I in bed?\nHERBERT: You’1l be right as rain soon enough. We all will.\nHARRY: I’m so tired, Herbie. I’ve not felt like this since...\nHERBERT: Try not to think about it. Have a drink of water.\nHARRY: At Wipers, Herbert, you sometimes had your water in a petrol can. Do you remember me telling you about Billy McVeigh? Sapper in the Royal Engineers. He could tell what kind of petrol had been in the can just from drinking the water.\nHERBERT: Harry, you know what’s coming, don’t you?\nHARRY: Ludo put me in the machine again. For talking about that blue box. Gave me the full whack. That’s how they’ve been doing it Harry. To stop us remembering.\nHERBERT: Never fear, Harry. The mist is clearing. And then it’1ll be you and me together. Over the top. Like it should have been in France.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 46\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 17: INT. THE ATTIC\nACE: [AS BUNTY] In Herefordshire, Hertfordshire and Hampshire Hurricanes Hardly Ever Happen.\nHEX: Oh what’s the use? He recognised us, didn’t he? He knew who we were.\nACE: No way. When the Professor’s onto something, his nostrils flare and his eyebrows knit. Never happened last night.\nHEX: I hate this. Lying to him. Manipulating him.\nACE: Yeah? Well he’s done it enough to us, hasn’t he? Putting us through the mangler. Setting us up.\nHEX: He just seems like a lost old guy. Like the sort who used to wander into A&E with their stuff in placky bags.\nACE: Don’t start feeling sorry for him, Hex. It doesn’t help.\nHEX: I just don’t like it, that’s all. It’s nasty.\nACE: It’s necessary.\nHEX: You’re enjoying this, aren’t you?\nHEX: What does the robot want?\nACE: They’re outside.\nHEX: Who?\nACE: The Doctor and Queenie. And Lola. And Mrs Kniddel. Look on his little screen.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 47\nHEX: What are they doing?\nACE: About half a mile an hour.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 48\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 18: EXT. THE MOUNTAIN\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: THE DOCTOR, QUEENIE, LOLA AND MRS KNIDDEL ARE HUFFING AND\nPUFFING: THROUGH THE SNOW. )\nLOLA: Hup! Hup! Hup! That’s right, let me see those knees!\nDOCTOR: Miss Luna!\nLOLA: How do you find the pace, Mrs Glasscock?\nQUEENIE: Madam, I have bicycled the London to Brighton with only a brief pause in Croydon for macaroons and sarsaparilla.\nLOLA: Bravo, Mrs Glasscock! Mrs Kniddel? Wunderbar! Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Eh?\nLOLA: Keeping up?\nDOCTOR: Just about. In fact, I’ve an idea.\nLOLA: Doctor, where are you going?\nDOCTOR: Care to run with me for a bit, Queenie?\nQUEENIE: Why not? (CALLING TO LOLA) The town is this way, I suppose?\nLOLA: (OFF) That’s right. But it’s a dull little place. Boring, you know.\nDOCTOR: I could cope with a little boredom. What I can’t cope with is another electric shock. Come on, Queenie.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 49\nDOCTOR WHO: Right behind you, Doctor. Don’t see the point in running if you’re not going anywhere.\nDOCTOR: Running away from something, I can understand that. Do it all the time. Running towards something, that has its appeals, too. But running round in circles?\nQUEENIE: Mind you, sometimes the last thing you want is to reach the end. The end can be a dangerous place to be.\nDOCTOR: I feel like a rat in a maze, Queenie. Every time I come within sniffing distance of a bit of cheese, someone clobbers me.\nQUEENIE: Or electrifies you.\nDOCTOR: Or whacks a shot of morphine into my bloodstream. Do people really come here to recuperate? This isn’t happening to you, too, is it Queenie?\nQUEENIE: No. Only you. Perhaps you deserve it, Doctor. Men are such beasts.\nDOCTOR: Or perhaps someone is protecting you. Perhaps you have the get out of jail free card. Or won second prize in a beauty contest.\nQUEENIE: What do you mean?\nDOCTOR: Maybe I’m not a rat. Maybe I’m a dog. Or a top hat.\nQUEENIE: Or a cuckoo clock? Oodles of those round here.\nDOCTOR: Games, Queenie, games. Thing is, I’m usually very good at them.\nQUEENIE: Not as good as my old dad, I'd wager.\nDOCTOR: Swapnil?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 50\nQUEENIE: He spent his youth in Rawalpindi. All he had was a chess set, two linen suits and his wits. He went from hill station to hill station, playing the memsahibs every day. He never went hungry. Never slept in a bed without a feather pillow.\nDOCTOR: Maybe we’re running in the wrong direction, then. Let’s go and see him.\nQUEENIE: Daddy, you mean?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Come on, they’ve given us the shoes — let’s put them to some use. (SLIPPING) Wooooaaaah! (TUMBLING) Queenie!\nQUEENIE: Doctor!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 51\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 19: INT. THE ATTIC\nQUEENIE: (FX: OVER ROBOT’S SCREEN) Doctor, are you alright-?\nHEX: Oh, the Doctor’s hit the deck.\nACE: Jogged too far, has he?\nHEX: He slipped on something. A patch of ice, I suppose.\nACE: No, something else. Something that was here before we arrived.\nHEX: Oh well, maybe a smack on the head will buy us a bit more time.\nHEX: Oh my God. Look at this.\nACE: He’s going to get a bit more than a smack on the head, then. Oh well. They’ve got their running shoes on, haven’t they?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 52\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 20: EXT. THE MOUNTAIN\nQUEENIE: Doctor! Let me help you up.\nDOCTOR: What was it this time?\nQUEENIE: No wonder you slipped.\nDOCTOR: What is it?\nQUEENIE: A square cut into the ground. Like glass. With writing on it.\nDOCTOR: (READING) ‘You cause... something... miss.’ Must be a message for you. I’m not a Miss.\nQUEENIE: Neither am I, Doctor. Let’s find out what the missing word is.\nQUEENIE: (FX: SHE RUBS AWAY AT THE LETTERS. A DISTANT RUMBLE BUILDS\nUNTIL: IT BECOMES A THUNDEROUS ROAR. )\nQUEENIE: Oh. (READING) ‘You cause an avalanche, miss.’\nDOCTOR: Oh dear. They’re wrong about your marital status, but...\nQUEENIE: Do you think we can outrun it?\nDOCTOR: We’ll have to try. Come on!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 53\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 21: EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE MOUNTAIN\nLOLA: Have you seen many avalanches at Hahlbruck, Mrs Kniddel? (PAUSE) It’s just that I’ve never seen one do that before. Move like that. It’s like a great gross serpent. A tentacle. Unusual, jah? (PAUSE) As is the fact that it’s only following the Doctor. Perhaps this is how it all ends, Mrs Kniddel. Perhaps this is how we all get back home.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 54\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 22: EXT. THE MOUNTAIN\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: AVALANCHE CLOSING IN; QUEENIE AND THE DOCTOR RUNNING FOR THEIR LIVES. )\nQUEENIE: If the girls at the velodrome could see me now! Tally-ho!\nDOCTOR: Queenie, this avalanche could kill us both! Stop enjoying yourself!\nQUEENIE: Sorry, Doctor! You’re quite right! Do we stand a chance, do you think?\nDOCTOR: I think you do.\nQUEENIE: What do you mean?\nDOCTOR: That’s not an ordinary avalanche. Watch what happens when I move away from you.\nQUEENIE: Heavens! It’s following you, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: You cause an avalanche. Miss a turn. I landed on that square. I’m being penalised.\nQUEENIE: Oh I see! Like snakes and ladders. So what you need is a change of luck. Another throw. Or — (SUDDENLY VERY EXCITED) — another\nQUEENIE: square to land on!\nDOCTOR: Yes. So I’d just run in the opposite direction if I were you.\nQUEENIE: No, look, there — another square to land on! By that ridge!\nDOCTOR: Queenie, you’re brilliant!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 55\nQUEENIE: Oh, it’s blank!\nDOCTOR: No, the letters are just iced over. (GETS OUT SONIC SCREWDRIVER.) Maybe I can melt it with this. (FX: SONIC SCREWDRIVER. )\nQUEENIE: Hurry up!\nDOCTOR: No, Queenie, you hurry up. Get out of here, now. Go on, get out!\nQUEENIE: Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Run! Just run!\nDOCTOR: (FX: SHE RUNS. THE DOCTOR WORKS WITH THE SCREWDRIVER. THE\nAVALANCHE: BUILDS TO A CRESCENDO. SCREWDRIVER SWITCHED OFF. )\nDOCTOR: Now, let’s see what this is. Oh, now that’s just ridiculous! How can anybody possibly do that?\nDOCTOR: Aaaaaarrrrghhh!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 56\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 23: INT. THE ATTIC\nHEX: Ace! He’s gone. He’s gone under. What are we going to do now?\nACE: I wouldn’t worry too much, Hex.\nHEX: What — now he’s dead all our troubles are over?\nACE: Look at the place where he slipped. It’s on the robot’s screen. You can read what it says.\nHEX: (READING) ‘You cause an avalanche. Miss a turn.’\nACE: Doesn’t sound very terminal, does it?\nHEX: So where’s he gone? Which channel is it?\nACE: Twiddle his knobs.\nACE: (FX: CHANGING CHANNELS ON THE ROBOT’S CHEST TV. LIVE RELAY FROM THE MOUNTAIN. )\nQUEENIE: (FROM TV SPEAKER) Doctor! Doctor are you alright?\nACE: There’s Queenie. Nothing wrong with her.\nACE: (FX: CLICK TO A NEW CHANNEL. RELAY FROM DOCTOR. ROAR OF THE AVALANCHE. )\nDOCTOR: (FROM SPEAKER) Whoooah!\nACE: Blimey.\nHEX: You’ve been with the Doctor for a while. Ever seen him do that before?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 57\nACE: Never had him down as a surfer, no.\nHEX: But where’s it carrying him?\nACE: At a guess — through the ballroom window.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 58\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 24: INT.

Brush the snow from his coat.(FX: HARRY AND HERBERT LIFT THE DOCTOR UP AND BRUSH\nHIM: DOWN.) And the broken glass, yes. What a mess.\nHARRY: You must be a professional, Doctor! Stunt like that.\nDOCTOR: Is my head still attached to my neck?\nHERBERT: Herbert and I once worked out a trick whereby we were catapulted trough some French windows on to a chaise longue. But it always went wrong during the last move. Didn’t it, Harry?\nHARRY: We should have put the chaise on castors, Herbie.\nDOCTOR: I unscrewed the ground beneath my feet. Only it wasn’t the ground. It was a wooden board.\nSWAPNIL: This wooden board. Sledging, would you call that?\nDOCTOR: Snowboarding, I'd say.\nHARRY: There’s writing on it.\nHERBERT: (READING) ‘You ride down the mountain on a wave of snow. Move on two spaces.’\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL)\nDOCTOR: So where have I landed, exactly?\nHARRY: This is the ballroom, Doctor. Well, it used to be. Swapnil requisitioned it.\nDOCTOR: And redecorated it?\nSWAPNIL: Yes, Doctor. All my own work. What do you think?\nDOCTOR: It’s very .. modern.\nHERBERT: You've turned the room into a gigantic chessboard.\nSWAPNIL: Not much dancing goes on here anymore.\nDOCTOR: Page\nDOCTOR: Until\nDOCTOR: Who’s your opponent, Swapnil.

And I\nSWAPNIL: had to make the pattern stand out.\nDOCTOR: Why are the black squares metal? Why not just paint the wood?\nSWAPNIL: So I can play in the dark after lights out. You can feel the metal under your feet. The cold ones are black, the warm ones are white. I take it you’ve recovered now, Doctor, after your\nSWAPNIL: accident?\nDOCTOR: Which one? I’m having them hourly.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 60\nSWAPNIL: Avalanche. French windows.\nDOCTOR: I pick myself up, brush myself down, and start all over again. How did you make the pieces, Swapnil? They’re hefty things.\nSWAPNIL: Ah, there I did have help. I carved them all myself — but Mrs Kniddel dragged the logs up the side of the mountain.\nDOCTOR: Mate in two moves, I see.\nSWAPNIL: Poppycock.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Look. You don’t need to be Capablanca to work it out.\nHARRY: Losing your touch, Swapnil?\nSWAPNIL: Never.\nDOCTOR: Yes, look, I’1l show you. Let’s bring this bishop down here.

Scratting about under the duckboards.\nHERBERT: Vermin, is it?\nSWAPNIL: Sounds to me as if it’s escaped from its trap.\nHARRY: Right. That settles it.\nHERBERT: Settles what, Harry?\nHARRY: I’m off to my room.\nHERBERT: What for?\nHARRY: To get my gun, old fellow.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 62\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 25: INT.

If we go back to the cable car maybe we can return to Davos. Book in somewhere there.\nSWAPNIL: No, my love. Can’t be done.\nQUEENIE: But what’s happening here, daddy?\nSWAPNIL: I hate to say this — because my father used to say it to me — but there are some questions that are better left unasked, my little fruit bat.\nSWAPNIL: (FX: A BANGING AND A SCUFFLING BEHIND THE WALL.

The cable car.\nACE: I’1l send the robot out to disable it.\nHEX: Ace — is this what it’s like being the Doctor?\nACE: What do you mean?\nHEX: Being the one who knows what’s going on, but can’t say what it is. Being the one with the masterplan — and not knowing whether it’s going to work out, or send the universe down the plughole...\nACE: Maybe it is.

Dr Black bricked up behind the wall. Not dead. Just hidden away.\nSWAPNIL: I mustn’t remember. Otherwise it’s checkmate. So no more questions, Queenie. I’ve said too much.\nHERBERT: (ENTERING) Yes I think you have.\nHARRY: (ENTERING) What are you talking about, you two?\nSWAPNIL: Harry...\nHARRY: I said what are you talking about?\nHERBERT: I’d answer the question if I were you.\nLOLA: Is that gun loaded, Harry?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 68\nQUEENIE: (FX: KNOCKING ON WALL) Hello?\nSWAPNIL: Queenie, don’t.\nQUEENIE: Hello, can you hear me? I’m fed up of all this. I want some answers. One knock for yes and two knocks for no.\nSWAPNIL: Don’t talk to him, Queenie.\nQUEENIE: Do you mean us any harm?\nHARRY: Stop that!\nQUEENIE: Do you mean the Doctor any harm?\nLOLA: He’s replying to her!\nHARRY: I’m warning you, Mrs Glasscock!\nQUEENIE: Are you trying to get out?\nHERBERT: My brother is pointing a gun in your direction, Queenie.\nQUEENIE: Can you get out?\nSWAPNIL: Be quiet, Queenie.\nLOLA: Stop her, Harry!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 69\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 28: INT. LUDO’S STUDY\nDOCTOR: What was that?\nLUDO: Harry, I think.\nDOCTOR: Nice couch you’ve put me on. This is your consulting room, I take it?\nLUDO: Correct.\nDOCTOR: Oh. Tell me the worst, then. What are you? Jungian? Kleinian?\nLUDO: Freudian, actually.\nDOCTOR: I’m sure it’s what Mother would have wanted.\nLUDO: Mother was a patient of Charcot at the Salpetriere in Paris. She performed her hysteria for him twice a day. Rolled her eyes and shrugged herself out of her negligee. The students went wild for her. She was the Sarah Bernhardt of mental pathology.\nDOCTOR: (YAWNS) Fascinating.\nLUDO: May I remind you, Doctor, that I am sitting in the alienist’s chair and you are the one in the recumbent posture.\nDOCTOR: Oh, do you mean you’re the one who’s asking the questions?\nLUDO: Look, Doctor, whatever you may think, I’m not your enemy. I’m trying to make things better.\nDOCTOR: I’ll believe that when I start to feel better.\nLUDO: Do you remember how you came here?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 70\nDOCTOR: By cable car. With Mrs Queenie Glasscock. Recently married but more recently jilted. By a man from the Herne Hill velodrome. And he seemed so nice. I hope you’re writing all of this down.\nDOCTOR: (FX: A DRY SCUFFLE. THE DUMMY IS SCRABBLING ITS WAY TOWARDS A\nPOSSIBLE: EXIT.)\nDOCTOR: What was that?\nLUDO: What’s your first memory of your parents?\nDOCTOR: Perhaps we should deal with my friends, first.\nDOCTOR: What is that noise?\nLUDO: Your friends?\nDOCTOR: Ace. And the other one. Scouse lad. We were talking to them both last night. Only they were behaving rather strangely. Like everybody else here. And that’s because you’re all part of a conspiracy.\nLUDO: Really, Doctor, this is textbook paranoia. You’1ll be telling me next that people are staring at you on trams.\nDOCTOR: I didn’t come to Switzerland for my health, Doctor Comfort. I was lured here, wasn’t I? I’ve put my foot in some sort of trap, and you’re keeping me inside it with electric shocks and morphine. But it’s stopped working. I’m learning to resist. I think I know who I am. Did you mother love you, Ludo?\nLUDO: She wanted to, Doctor. She wanted to.\nLUDO: (FX: THE NOISE IS CLOSER — THE DUMMY HAS SQUEEZED ITS WAY FROM THE WALLSPACE INTO A BUILT-IN CUPBOARD. A CHINK OF BOTTLES. )\nDOCTOR: Do you think, Doctor Comfort, that there might be a rodent in your medicine cabinet?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 71\nLUDO: Rats love Switzerland. All the cheese, you know.\nDOCTOR: And you lay poison for them, do you?\nLUDO: Yes we do.\nDOCTOR: But they’re clever little creatures, rats. They learn to ignore the bait. They learn that behind the wainscot, there’s no such thing as a free lunch. They learn to bite back.\nDOCTOR: Who’s in the cabinet, Ludo?\nLUDO: Nobody.\nDOCTOR: It’s not your mother, is it?\nLUDO: No.\nDOCTOR: Who, then? A patient?\nLUDO: I don’t know. I’ve heard the noise from time to time. I’ve never dared to look.\nDOCTOR: Why?\nLUDO: Doctor, the more you discover, the more you put us all in danger.\nDOCTOR: Ludo, in the past fifteen hours or so I’ve been caught up in an avalanche. I’ve been drugged. I’ve received two electric shocks of considerable ferocity. I want to know why. I’m going to open the cupboard.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL)\nLUDO: Please, Doctor...!\nDOCTOR: Get your hands off me, Ludo.\nLUDO: Don’t do it!\nDOCTOR: Well, that isn’t what I expected.\nLUDO: No.\nDOCTOR: Did you know this was here?\nLUDO: No.\nDOCTOR: You’re not a friend of this little wooden man?\nLUDO: No.\nDOCTOR: You don’t do a ventriloquist act as your party piece?\nLUDO: No.\nDOCTOR: Then why is he here?\nLUDO: And who is he?\nDOCTOR: Page 72\nDOCTOR: Ludo — his name — it’s just come into my head. Like someone\nDOCTOR: lifting a curtain.\nLUDO: His mouth, Doctor. He’s going to speak.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 73\nDOCTOR: Hello. Are you who I think you are? Are you the Toymaker? The Celestial Toymaker?\nDUMMY: Gockleageer... Doc-tor!\nDUMMY: END OF PART TWO\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 74"

(SILENCE) Lost your tongue, have you?\nLUDO: I’ve heard the name before. In a novel, perhaps? The Celestial Toymaker. Who is he? A sort of Fu Manchu?\nDOCTOR: He’s from the Old Times. A spirit of mischief from the infancy of the universe.\nLUDO: I take it you’re recovering from your aphasic episode, then?\nDOCTOR: I know who I am. I know who he is. I know who the people in the attic are. But who are you, Ludo? Who are you? And what are we all doing here?\nLUDO: Before you blew up the machine, Doctor, I used to self- administer a little dose of electricity. Just before I went to bed each night. It cleared my head, that little dose of electricity. Allowed me to get a good night’s sleep. I didn’t get my medicine last night. By the end of today, I may be able to answer your question.\nDOCTOR: Ludo, there’s something else you should know about the Toymaker.\nLUDO: What?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 75\nDOCTOR: He likes games.\nLUDO: So he’s a jolly sort of chap then, is he?\nDOCTOR: If he wins.\nLUDO: It’s the same with all children, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Children tend not to kill their opponents if they beat them at snakes and ladders.\nLUDO: Did it sound familiar to you, Doctor? The voice?\nDOCTOR: Why do you ask, Ludo?\nLUDO: For a moment I wondered if —\nQUEENIE: (DISTANTLY) Aaaaaaaargh!\nDOCTOR: Queenie!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 76\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 30: INT.

Harry — do you have Mrs Dose, the Doctor’s Wife?\nHARRY: I do, sweetheart. And I must yield her.\nLOLA: Feeling better, Harry? Now you’ve let off a bit of steam?\nHARRY: I’ve a game to concentrate on, haven’t I?\nHERBERT: I wonder if she’s alright? Mrs Glasscock, I mean.\nHARRY: Don’t think I went too far, do you?\nHERBERT: What do you think, Swapnil? You stood by and watch it happen.\nSWAPNIL: Yes, well, I had my reasons. I lost control for a moment. And I said too much. And she asked too much. She would have endangered us all if someone hadn’t stopped her.\nLOLA: Herbert — do you have the Doctor himself? Herr Dose?\nHERBERT: Not me, Miss Luna.\nSWAPNIL: I’m simply happy that she’s out of the game...\nSWAPNIL: (FX: DOCTOR THROWS OPEN THE DOOR. HARRY AND HERBERT JUMP TO THEIR FEET. )\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 77\nDOCTOR: Where is she?\nSWAPNIL: For the moment, at least.\nDOCTOR: (MARCHING FORWARD) Where is she?!\nLOLA: Fell out of the window, darling. Gazing at the moonlight on the snow. And out she tumbled. Over the balustrade. What is the word?\nHERBERT: Defenestrated!\nLOLA: Defenestrated. Danke!\nDOCTOR: Swapnil, what’s going on?\nSWAPNIL: I’m just trying to keep out of it all, really, old chum. And to keep Queenie out of it, too.\nDOCTOR: Let me pass, gentlemen. I need to get to that balcony.\nLOLA: Harry. Herbert. Stand aside. Let’s get back to our game.\nDOCTOR: Thank-you.\nDOCTOR: Queenie! Queenie! Can you hear me?\nQUEENIE: (FROM DOWN BELOW) Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Queenie, are you alright?\nQUEENIE: (FROM DOWN BELOW) I’m not dead, if that’s what you mean, Doctor. Wonderful things, snowdrifts.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page\nDOCTOR: Stay put. I’m coming to get you.\nQUEENIE: (FROM DOWN BELOW) Right-ho.\nSWAPNIL: Is the dear girl unhurt?\nDOCTOR: No thanks to you, Swapnil.\nSWAPNIL: You must think me an irresponsible parent, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Discuss it with your analyst, Swapnil, not me.\nLOLA: Mrs Kniddel — you have Mr Dose the Doctor! Put him on the table. Where we can see him.\nLOLA: 78\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 79\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 31: INT. THE ATTIC\nLUDO: (MUFFLED BY THE DOOR) Will you let me in, please?\nACE: Evening, Ludo.\nLUDO: The gloves are off. Someone’s pushed Queenie out of the window.\nACE: You were right, Hex. Things are starting to go mental.\nHEX: We’re gonna have a murder before tea.\nLUDO: I fear you’re right. It’s the Doctor’s influence. He knows about someone named the Toymaker.\nACE: Oh yeah?\nLUDO: He’s the one behind all this, isn’t he? Isn’t he? The Celestial Toymaker.\nACE: Well...\nLUDO: He’s like a puzzle in my head that’s slowly being solved. Like a crossword being filled in.\nHEX: Just don’t think about it, Ludo.\nACE: Does the Doctor know about us? Does he know who we are?\nLUDO: So he says.\nACE: Okay. And where is this dummy now?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 80\nLUDO: In my consulting room.\nHEX: Let’s have a dekko. (FX: HEX SWITCHES ON THE ROBOT’S SCANNER. )\nLUDO: It’s vanished!\nACE: Must have gone for a walk.\nLUDO: It could be anywhere in the clinic. Watching us.\nHEX: Ludo!\nACE: Come on, guys, we need an idea here. Something to distract the patients.\nLUDO: How about — a grand talent competition? Singing. Dancing. Dramatic recitation. You know the kind of thing.\nHEX: Juggling. I know someone who likes juggling.\nLUDO: Juggling, why not? Participation compulsory. Cigars and muffins gratis.\nACE: It might give us a bit more time.\nHEX: We’d need an MC.\nLUDO: Eh?\nHEX: A master of ceremonies.\nLUDO: A chair. Yes, of course. Well, that’s easy. You. And her.\nACE: That’s a terrible idea.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 81\nHEX: No, he’s right. We’ve been hiding up here. Avoiding awkward questions. Just think how freaked out everyone would be if Bunty and Bobo rose from their sickbeds and came down from he attic and ...\nACE: Did cabaret?\nHEX: Yeah, exactly. They wouldn’t know what to do.\nLUDO: We require uproar. Singing and dancing. Noise. Anything that will stop them — stop us — from thinking straight.\nHEX: And stop anyone getting too close a look at that ventriloquist’s doll.\nACE: Right. Okay. So you go and tell everyone the good news. And me and my friend here...\nHEX: What?\nACE: We’re going after that dummy. With an axe.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 82\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 32: EXT. OUTSIDE THE CLINIC\nQUEENIE: (DISTANT) Over here, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: It’s dark, isn’t it?\nQUEENIE: Getting darker.\nDOCTOR: I can’t quite...\nQUEENIE: You see the heap of snow on the ground next to the rockery?\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nQUEENIE: That’s me. I went in feet first. I’m up to my neck.\nDOCTOR: So you are. May I [pull you out?]\nQUEENIE: Please do.\nDOCTOR: Anything broken, Queenie?\nQUEENIE: Only my sherry schooner. I was having a nice sweet one when someone gave me the old heave-ho.\nDOCTOR: Who did?\nQUEENIE: I’m not sure. Listen here, Doctor — Harry was taking potshots at the plaster with his old service revolver.\nDOCTOR: Why?\nQUEENIE: Trying to hit the thing behind the wall.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 83\nDOCTOR: Did they get it?\nQUEENIE: No. Harry ran out of bullets and it all seemed to be on the point of calming down so I decided to have a drink. To steady my nerves, do you see? And as I fell I felt the oddest sensation.\nDOCTOR: Yes?\nQUEENIE: Before I hit the ground, I could have sworn I’d just bounced off a large sheet of canvas. Is that important?\nDOCTOR: I’m not sure. Do you think you could face going back up there, Queenie? Back to the clinic? To the games room?\nQUEENIE: To the place where someone tried to kill me, you mean?\nDOCTOR: Yes. It’s just that I have some friends up in the attic. They’re called Ace and Hex. And they owe me an apology.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 84\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 33: INT. HALLWAY\nLUDO: Come on, come on! Put down your poker chips and your cribbage boards! Everybody!\nSWAPNIL: (ENTERING) What’s this hullabaloo, old boy? Some of us are here for are our nerves, you know.\nLOLA: Mein gott! It’s like last orders at the Blue Angel... Mrs Kniddel, don’t distress yourself.\nHARRY: What’s got into you, mate?\nLUDO: Now listen to me!\nHERBERT: He’s supposed to be the sane one, isn’t he?\nLUDO: (EXCITED) Can anyone here do the sand-dance? Or whistle the Flight of the Bumblebee? Come on, who’s for a bit of fun?\nHARRY: Well...\nLUDO: There’s a treat for us all tonight. A grand talent competition. In the ballroom. You can do anything you fancy — as long as it has star quality.\nSWAPNIL: What’s it for, Ludo?\nLUDO: Entertainment. And the therapeutic benefit will be enormous!\nHARRY: Oh yeah?\nLUDO: Everyone gets a muffin, too.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 85\nSWAPNIL: A muffin?\nLUDO: Or a cigar.\nDOCTOR: (ENTERING) Hello everyone.\nSWAPNIL: Queenie!\nQUEENIE: Please don’t inquire after my health, daddy. It doesn’t become you. Not in the light of your recent behaviour.\nSWAPNIL: Fair enough, Queenie.\nQUEENIE: What would mother say, if she were here?\nSWAPNIL: I don’t know, Queenie.\nQUEENIE: I think I do.\nDOCTOR: (CHANGING THE SUBJECT) Have we missed something? You look like you’re about to take a vote.\nHARRY: We all have to do a turn. Tonight. In the ballroom.\nLUDO: It’s a talent competition.\nHARRY: A concert party.\nDOCTOR: In these circumstances? With something nasty in the wainscot and patients running around with guns?\nLUDO: That’s just the point. It’ll be calming. It’1ll be restorative.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 86\nSWAPNIL: What do you do, Doctor? What’s your speciality?\nDOCTOR: Escapology.\nHERBERT: Good lord. This is going to be embarrassing.\nLOLA: No, this is just what I’ve been waiting for! A chance to shake the dust off my vocal chords. Ach, Ludo, I could kiss you all over!\nLUDO: It’s not that sort of show, Miss Luna...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 87\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 34: INT. BALLROOM.\nHEX: Good to be out of that attic. Seems like years, doesn’t it?\nACE: Four weeks, Hex. Get a grip.\nHEX: Hear anything?\nACE: No. Not behind the walls, anyway.\nHEX: Maybe you should put the axe somewhere out of sight. In the piano. It might be putting him off.\nACE: Suppose. (FX: ACE PUTS THE AXE INSIDE THE PIANO AND CLOSES THE LID)\nHEX: Very nice.\nACE: I’m surprised Swapnil kept the piano. He got rid of everything else.\nHEX: He should be on DIY SOS. He’s wasted here.\nACE: Pull up a rook.\nHEX: Do you think he was as crazy as this before he came here?\nACE: If you’re a little bit bananas and you want to be a total fruit loop, Hahlbruck’s the place to come. Hang on. Here he is.\nSWAPNIL: Well!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 88\nACE: (BUNTY VOICE) Hello Swapnil.\nSWAPNIL: In all my puff!\nHEX: (BOBO VOICE) We were just taking a look at your chessboard, old boy. Hope you don’t mind.\nSWAPNIL: Bunty and Bobo Stetterton! But I don’t have anything in! Nota solitary Planter’s peanut.\nACE: (AS BUNTY) We’re not here for a drink, Swapnil. Old boy. We’re here to ask you a jolly old favour.\nSWAPNIL: Fire away my dear. Both barrels.\nACE: (AS BUNTY) This chessboard.\nSWAPNIL: Built it with my own hands, Bunty.\nACE: (AS BUNTY) Whatever you say, Swapnil. Do you think you’d be able to up the voltage on the jolly old thing?\nSWAPNIL: Well, I don’t know.\nACE: (AS BUNTY)\nACE: It’d really help, you see, because the Doctor smashed up the\nECT: equipment. And now, when anyone has a funny turn, there’s nothing Ludo can do to...\nHEX: Calm them down?\nACE: (AS HERSELF) Yeah. (AS BUNTY) Yes. Give them a bit of peace from all their troubles.\nSWAPNIL: Well I could have a bop at it, Bunty old girl. But there’s this competition to rehearse for. Ludo’s very insistent, you know. The talent show.\nACE: (AS BUNTY)\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 89\nDOCTOR WHO: I’m sure he wouldn’t mind you concentrating on this for a bit. It’s what we all need.\nSWAPNIL: Very well. I shall devote the next hour to electrical jiggery- pokery. But after that — well, Queenie and I need time to prepare. You can’t be slack if you are aiming to perform the Indian Rope Trick.\nACE: (AS BUNTY) The Indian Rope Trick?\nSWAPNIL: Yes, and a spot of fire-eating, too.\nHEX: (AS BOBO) Who’s doing that? Not Queenie!\nSWAPNIL: Yes. Queenie. You can’t have the Indian rope trick without fire-eating. That would be like Henley Regatta without the [muffins —]\nSWAPNIL: Enter.\nSWAPNIL: (FX: THEY DO. IT’S QUEENIE. SHE IS CARRYING A LARGE CAN OF PETROL. )\nSWAPNIL: There you are, my dear. Did you get it?\nQUEENIE: Of course I did. (FX: SLOSHING CAN) A whole gallon of Mr Esso’s best. But don’t think I’ve forgiven you, daddy. If you go up in flames I’m not jumping on the pyre.\nSWAPNIL: Of course not, my love. That’s show business.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 90\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 35: INT. GAMES ROOM\nDOCTOR: (ENTERING) Not playing anything, Harry? I think this is the first time I’ve been in the games room and found nothing in progress.\nHARRY: I fancied a read of my paper. Where’ve you been, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I’ve just been up to the attic, Harry. But it seems to be empty. You don’t know anything about that, do you?\nHARRY: Nothing, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: You haven’t seen a woman and a man in evening dress, pretending to be members of the upper ten thousand?\nHARRY: No.\nDOCTOR: I know them as Ace and Hex. But someone has convinced them that they’re Bunty and Bobo Stetterton. And I think I know who.\nHARRY: Oh, yes, I’ve seen them, Doctor. See them every day.\nDOCTOR: Where?\nHARRY: Here. In the Tatler. (READS) ‘Mr and Mrs Bunty and Bobo Stetterton, setting out from Curzon Street to lunch with Lady Seafield, fresh from their triumph at the Cresta Run.’ (STOPS READING) She’s got lovely pearls, ain’t she?\nDOCTOR: (READING) ‘Bunty Stetterton remarked that “everyone is getting married” — which when narrowed down meant two of her cousins —\nDOCTOR: Lady Stella Howard and Lady Moira Twysden.’\nHARRY: Stone me. I wonder what the poor people are doing?\nDOCTOR: I wonder what Ace and Hex are doing?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 91\nHARRY: What do you mean?\nDOCTOR: This isn’t a picture of them.\nHARRY: Do you mean — this lot in the magazine are impostors?\nDOCTOR: No! I mean... (SPOTTING TARDIS DOODLE) What’s this you’ve doodled in the margin?\nHARRY: I’m not sure I should talk about that. Ludo wouldn’t like it.\nDOCTOR: Ludo isn’t here.\nHARRY: Yes, but.\nDOCTOR: What is it? What is this thing? You’ve done this, haven’t you?\nHARRY: Yes.\nDOCTOR: So what is it?\nHARRY: I don’t know. I see it, sometimes, when I don’t try to see it. At the edge of my field of vision.\nDOCTOR: It’s made of wood.\nHARRY: It’s painted blue.\nDOCTOR: Scotland Yard blue. What else?\nHARRY: It has a yellow lamp on the top. And there’s a sound that goes with it. A scraping sound.\nDOCTOR: What’s it called, Harry? It has a name, doesn’t it?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 92\nHARRY: No!\nDOCTOR: But what did he do with it?\nHARRY: Who?\nDOCTOR: The Toymaker. It must be the Toymaker. He must have stolen it.\nHARRY: Stolen what?\nDOCTOR: The TARDIS! It’s where I live. It’s my home. He stole it once before. Led me a merry dance. But that was in his world. And we’re on Earth.\nHARRY: It’s funny you talking about a toymaker. I fancy I’ve met him on the halls.\nDOCTOR: He’s a hyperdimensional being. He has a whole sliver of reality to himself. He sometimes sneaks out of it to kidnap his players, but he can’t survive for long beyond his domain. Those were the rules. Laid down in the childhood of the universe. So how could the Toymaker be in Switzerland?\nHARRY: Maybe we'll find out at tonight’s show.\nDOCTOR: Listen! Did you hear that?\nHARRY: Yes. I did.\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) He’s in this room with us. Sitting in the armchair on the other side of the billiard table. He’s been here all the time.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 93\nHARRY: (SOTTO) I mustn’t look at him, Doctor. I mustn't...\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) Close your eyes, then. Stick your fingers in your ears, too, if that helps. (FX: RISES AND CROSSES THE ROOM) Good evening.\nDUMMY: So comfortable, these chairs. Horsehair, are they? Now, who’s for a round of hangman?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 94\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 36: INT. BALLROOM\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: FADE UP. A FLURRY OF ACTIVITY. HAMMERING.

It’ll do.\nHARRY: I think that’1l hold.\nLOLA: A good show is like a good shower. It can be pretty embarrassing without a curtain.\nHERBERT: Everybody here yet?\nQUEENIE: Harry and Herbert. Mrs Kniddel. Swapnil and Queenie. Ludo. Where are the guests of honour, Ludo?\nLUDO: Waiting in the wings. All we need now is...\nQUEENIE: Doctor!

Over there will do.\nHERBERT: You’1l be escaping from this box tonight, then?\nDOCTOR: Wait and see, Herbert. Let’s put it at the side of the stage.\nQUEENIE: (SOTTO) I need a word with you, Doctor.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 95\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) Let’s sit together, then.\nLUDO: We’re all here, so I think we can begin, then. Mrs Kniddel?\nLUDO: Thank you Mrs Kniddel, thank you. It’s time for me to introduce you to the golden couple who will act as our comperes for tonight. You’ve read about them in the press. It’s the Honourable Mr and Mrs Bunty and Bobo Stetterton.\nDOCTOR: At last!\nACE: (AS BUNTY) Thank you Ludo. It’s great to be here, isn’t it Bobo?\nHEX: (AS BOBO) Indeed it is Bunty. Finally, down here among the good people of Hahlbruck.\nDOCTOR: Cured, are you?\nHEX: (AS BOBO) Completely.\nDOCTOR: I doubt it, Hex. He’s more powerful than you think. Once you’re playing with him, he can get into your mind. Make you forget yourself.\nHEX: (AS BOBO) We have a packed programme of entertainment for you tonight. I know I’m looking forward to it and I hope you are too.\nDOCTOR: I’m looking forward to setting you free from whatever form of mind-control you’re under — Bobo!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 96\nACE: (AS BUNTY)\nACE: Yes, what a bill we have. Entertainment of every form imaginable. So settle down, open your sandwiches or your bag of nuts, and put your hands together for the first act of the night.\nQUEENIE: (SOTTO) Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Yes?\nQUEENIE: Lola’s on first. When she does her turn I’m going to slip away.\nDOCTOR: Slip away where?\nQUEENIE: Outside. I’m going to try and find a safe route to the town.\nDOCTOR: I wouldn’t advise it. You saw what happened last time.\nQUEENIE: Promise not to give me away?\nDOCTOR: Well...\nQUEENIE: I knew you wouldn’t let me down. (FX: SHE KISSES HIM.)\nHEX: Bertolt Brecht once drank champagne from her shoe. Boy, did he have a hangover in the morning! And what did she think of Bertolt, you’re asking? She thought he was Weill.

May I present Mrs Queenie Glasscock — the female Prometheus!\nSWAPNIL: Where is she?\nHERBERT: What’s happened to her?\nDOCTOR: (FX: LEAPING TO THE STAGE) Never fear, everybody!\nHEX: (AS BOBO) Please take your seat, sir.\nDOCTOR: I have another idea. Let me entertain you!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 103\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 39: EXT. CABLE CAR PLATFORM/INT. CABLE CAR\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: QUEENIE IS RUNNING THROUGH THE SNOW AS FAST AS SHE CAN, CLUTCHING A BAG. )\nACE: (AS BUNTY) (FOLLOWING) Queenie! Queenie, stop!\nQUEENIE: Not likely!\nACE: (AS BUNTY)\nACE: I know what you’re planning. The cable car won’t work. It’s been sabotaged. And anyway, it doesn’t go to Davos. It’ll just bring you back here.\nQUEENIE: (FX: COMING TO A HALT) I’m not planning to go to Davos. I hate Davos.\nACE: (AS HERSELF — SHE’S FORGETTING TO KEEP THE ACCENT UP) Then what are you up to?\nQUEENIE: Well that’s between me and the contents of this carpet bag.\nQUEENIE: Obliging, aren’t they? You just stand near it and it all starts\nQUEENIE: ups\nACE: Don’t get on it, Queenie.\nQUEENIE: What happened to your Roedean vowels, Mrs Stetterton?\nACE: Just don’t get on it.\nQUEENIE: Too late!\nQUEENIE: (FX: SHE JUMPS ON BOARD, AND SLAMS THE DOOR. THE CAR BEGINS TO MOVE. )\nACE: I’m coming to get you out of there, Queenie!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 104\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: ACE JUMPS TOWARDS THE CABLE CAR AND WRENCHES OPEN THE DOOR. )\nQUEENIE: You’re insane!\nACE: Insane enough to jump into a moving cable car, yeah. Particularly as I asked the robot to put them out of action. Maybe he just forgot.\nQUEENIE: There was a girl like you on the bicycling team. Mad Fanny we called her. Calves like flitches of bacon. No sense of danger.\nACE: Let’s have a look in the bag, Queenie. Come on.\nQUEENIE: Alright.\nQUEENIE: (FX: QUEENIE OPENS THE BAG. SHE PULLS OUT A MILK BOTTLE FULL OF PETROL WITH A RAG FUSE. A CHINK OF GLASS. )\nACE: Hey, that’s a Molotov Cocktail!\nQUEENIE: A firebomb, I think you mean.\nACE: Yeah, but what are you going to do with it?\nQUEENIE: Burn down the sky, of course.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 105\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 40: INT. GAMES ROOM\nDOCTOR: You may be wondering, ladies and gentlemen, what lurks inside my trunk.\nHEX: (AS BOBO) Take it easy, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: All of you are being kept here against your will — Swapnil, Mrs Kniddel, Harry, Herbert, Lola. You, Hex. And Queenie and Ace, too, wherever they are.\nHEX: Please, just for once in your life, leave it alone.\nDOCTOR: What do you think, ladies and gentlemen? Should I keep quiet, or open the box?\nLOLA: Open the box.\nDOCTOR: Thank you, Miss Luna.\nLUDO: Don’t do it, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Dr Comfort — I’d almost forgotten that you were here. Having fun?\nHARRY: We want to see what’s inside, don’t we Herbert?\nHERBERT: We do, Harry. What about you, Swapnil?\nSWAPNIL: Oh, I don’t know. It’s just a box.\nDOCTOR: The box, I agree, is nothing special. It’s what’s inside that counts.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 106\nHARRY: What the blazes is that, Herbert?\nHERBERT: It’s a mechanical man.\nDOCTOR: Glad you could make it. What do you think, little robot?\nROBOT: Open the box.\nDOCTOR: Very well.\nHERBERT: A dummy. A vent’s dummy.\nLUDO: You don’t know what you’re doing, Doctor. Oh Lord, it’s happening. I’m remembering him. I’m finally remembering him.\nDOCTOR: Allow me to introduce an old enemy.\nLOLA: I remember him too.\nHARRY: The Toymaker.\nHERBERT: The Celestial Toymaker.\nHARRY: We did for him, didn’t we, Herbert? The old Chinese mandarin.\nLOLA: He thought that he could control us, but he was wrong. It can see it all happening, like a film running in my head. He brought us to his world.\nSWAPNIL: And he made us play games.\nHARRY: So many games. Things we’d never heard of.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 107\nLUDO: But we challenged him. We challenged him to play all those games simultaneously. Slaves against the master.\nLOLA: I remember our moment of victory. He threw up his hands in horror. And the playing cards blew up around him. Like Alice in Wonderland. And after it was over — he’d turned into that thing. That doll.\nHERBERT: We overpowered him together.\nLOLA: He was a mandarin.\nSWAPNIL: So we divided him into segments, and each ate one up.\nHERBERT: And we came back here to recover, didn’t we, Harry? We all came to Hahlbruck for a good old rest. Put our feet up for a bit. Why couldn’t I remember this yesterday?\nLUDO: We each held a little piece of him in our heads. So we came here to Hahlbruck — my alma mater — and we used the ECT machine to keep him confined in our unconscious minds. Because if we couldn’t remember he was there...\nLOLA: Then he couldn’t escape. And we would keep him in his place. Keep him beaten. Until he was no more.\nDOCTOR: You beat the Toymaker? A bunch of humans beat the Toymaker and brought him home to earth? In pieces? It’s ridiculous! It’s impossible.\nLUDO: Impossible, yes. On our own. But we had help, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Help from whom?\nLUDO: From you, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: From me?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 108\nLUDO: And from your friends. Mr and Mrs Stetterton.\nDOCTOR: From Hex and Ace.\nHEX: You’ve really stuffed this one up, Doctor. All we needed was a couple more hours and the Toymaker would have withered away.\nDOCTOR: Hex, what’s happening?\nHEX: It was your plan, Doctor. You set all this up. A hundred games at once, just like you always do. So tell us — what do we do now?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know. I’ve played against myself.\nDUMMY: And lost, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Ah. So you found your voice again, have you? You’ve found someone’s voice, certainly —\nDUMMY: Pull back the curtain, Mrs Kniddel. (FX: CURTAIN IS PULLED. ) All of you — look out of the window. The cable car.\nLOLA: It’s moving.\nHEX: It can’t be moving. Me and Ace had it shut down.\nLOLA: Who’s on board?\nDOCTOR: Queenie. It must be Queenie.\nSWAPNIL: (ODDLY UNCONCERNED) Yes, I suppose it must be.\nDUMMY: Not only her. The Honourable Mrs Bunty Stetterton also.\nHEX: Oh my God.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 109\nDUMMY: A string of diamonds across the neck of the mountain... I wonder\nDUMMY: what would happen if that string were to snap?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 110\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 41: INT.

Trust me on this.\nQUEENIE: We’ll see.\nACE: All your firebomb’s gonna do is melt some snow. It won’t help any of the others. It won’t help your dad.\nQUEENIE: Not like you’ve been helping him, with electric shocks. (FX:\nSTRIKES: MATCH; LIGHTS FUSE) What a beauty! Out of the window you must go!\nSTRIKES: (FX: THE CABLE CAR GRINDS TO A HALT. THE LIGHTS SIZZLE AND FAIL. )\nQUEENIE: What happened to the lights? Shall I strike a match?\nACE: No. Don’t strike anything. This could be very bad.\nACE: (FX: METAL CABLES TWIST AND SNAG.

My legs are pieces of wood with a hinge where my hyperdimensional knees should be. And yet I know your desires. And I can satisfy them. Miss Luna!\nLOLA: Yes?\nDUMMY: There’s a little piece of me in you, Miss Luna. And it’s stirring up such thoughts, isn’t it? You’d like the doctors to pluck that pneumothoracic tube from your addled lung. You’d like to hit all the high notes in Lili Marlene. And to sing again in your own little club.\nLOLA: It would be divine.\nDUMMY: And you can have it. You can have it all. If you play along. Here’s what I intend. You will take on each other in games of my choosing. And when we have one victor, one winner, one player triumphant...\nLOLA: Ja?\nDUMMY: I will sit on their knee. And give them what they want.\nDOCTOR: Don’t listen to him, Lola. He’s only made of wood.\nDUMMY: Miss Luna — whom do you choose as your first opponent?\nLOLA: I choose Mrs Kniddel.

My psychosynthetic powers are not what they once were.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 117\nDOCTOR WHO: Hang on loose and we’ll be back in a deuce.\nHEX: (SOTTO) What’s that?\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) A game show set.

Of course I did. But the Doctor’s not in this round. So let’s play.\nDUMMY: Easy one, this. I’m going to pose a question based on one of our surveys. All you have to do is answer it. Miss Luna, I believe you won the toss.\nLOLA: TL did ¢\nDUMMY: Then you can begin. We asked 100 teachers, has a pupil ever given you an apple? Miss Luna, how many said yes?\nLOLA: Erm.\nDUMMY: How many of the teachers we surveyed said they had been in receipt of that most attractive fruit?\nLOLA: Twenty-four.\nDUMMY: Twenty-four. Now, Mrs Kniddel, is the true answer higher or lower? What do you think, boys?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 118\nHARRY: Higher?\nHERBERT: Lower?\nSWAPNIL: Higher.\nDUMMY: Thanks boys. Mrs Kniddel. Just point up or down, there’s a love. (SHE DOES SO.) Higher you say? Let’s see, shall we? Robot! Reveal the legend!\nSWAPNIL: What a clever little automaton.\nDUMMY: It was lower. The actual number of teachers who said they’d received this juicy little gift was fifteen. So, Mrs Kniddel, that means that you get the first electric shock. 200 volts. Robot!\nDUMMY: And still she remains silent. But will she stay that way? Because there’s another shock on its way — Miss Luna, will the\nDUMMY: next voltage be higher or lower?\nDUMMY: HARRY AND HERBERT AND SWAPNIL Lower! Lower!\nLOLA: Higher. Definitely higher!\nDUMMY: Let’s give it a whirl.\nDUMMY: You were right. Five hundred volts!\nHERBERT: He’s killed her.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 119\nDUMMY: Not yet. Higher or lower, Miss Luna?\nLOLA: Higher.\nLOLA: (FX: POSITIVE CHIME, THEN A CRACKLE. MRS KNIDDEL SCREAMS. A\nWOODEN: CLUNK. )\nLOLA: Elsa... a little doll.\nDUMMY: Put her in the toybox, Swapnil. I think we have a winner. Miss Luna, I’m going to sit on your knee.\nDUMMY: There, that wasn’t so bad, was it?\nLOLA: Nein, nein!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 120\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 46: INT. ATTIC\nDOCTOR: So, Mr Schofield, tell me what I’ve missed.\nHEX: You’re unbelievable sometimes, you know that.\nDOCTOR: Tell me what happened. Then perhaps we can get back to the ballroom and stop any more of it happening. This is where you were hiding? Your little robot’s gone, I see.\nHEX: You had it all worked out, didn’t you? New identities to stop\nHEX: all the patients remembering us. Bringing the Toymaker back to the clinic. Keeping everybody in the dark long enough for his\nHEX: powers to fail.\nDOCTOR: The Toymaker can’t survive for long outside his world. It might have worked.\nHEX: And it did work. The Toymaker pulled the TARDIS into his world and forced us to play his games. But we organised a revolution. We all played against him. And the Toymaker lost. His body turned into a toy — just like one of his victims.\nDOCTOR: But how did we get the Toymaker to Earth?\nHEX: That was easy. We just clicked our fingers, like he does. Used a little bit of that power.\nDOCTOR: Who clicked their fingers?\nHEX: Ludo did. It was his idea to use the clinic as a hiding place. A place where a bit of craziness wouldn’t be noticed.\nDOCTOR: So everyone has a splinter of the Toymaker lodged in his or her mind... I can feel him in my head, scuttering about. A rat in the skull.\nHEX: No wonder they’re all nuts.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 121\nDOCTOR: But he’s not in you or in Ace. Is he?\nHEX: No. You put us in charge. To make sure you all got your juice — so you wouldn’t remember. So we could keep track of the time until all those pieces of the Toymaker just broke down. That was Plan A. But now he’s sticking himself back together again.\nDOCTOR: And what about Queenie?\nHEX: What about her?\nDOCTOR: I think she exists outside this, too.\nHEX: I dunno about her.\nDOCTOR: Can I smell burning?\nHEX: Open the skylight.\nDOCTOR: It’s the sky, Hex. It’s on fire.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 122\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 47: INT. BALLROOM\nSWAPNIL: Looks a picture, doesn’t it? The clouds peeling away from the air.\nHARRY: The world is just one big cyclorama.\nHERBERT: We’re not really on a mountain at all. It’s like a stage set.\nSWAPNIL: A huge sheet of canvas.\nHARRY: A huge sheet of burning canvas.\nHERBERT: What does it all mean? What do you think, Lola?\nLOLA: I don’t know. I’m a little distracted. Mrs Kniddel has turned into a German doll and there’s a little wooden man sitting on my knee.\nDUMMY: You've inherited Mrs Kniddel’s share of the my power, Miss Luna. How does it feel?\nLOLA: Interesting.\nDUMMY: Just imagine, Lola, what it would be like to hold all the cards.\nLOLA: Exhilarating, darling, I suspect.\nSWAPNIL: Little dummy — isn’t the burning sky a more pressing problem?\nDUMMY: I don’t think so. Now. Harry and Herbert!\nDUMMY: HARRY and HERBERT Yes?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 123\nDUMMY: You’re in with a chance as we play — What’s my Punchline!\nHARRY: What’s my what?\nDUMMY: Fingers on buzzers please. I wouldn’t say my mother-in-law was fat, but...\nDUMMY: Harry?\nHARRY: She has a dysfunction of the pituitary gland.\nDUMMY: Sorry, Harry. Do you know it, Miss Luna?\nLOLA: Actually, I think I do.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 124\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 48: INT. ATTIC\nHEX: What’s causing it? Some kind of gas, maybe?\nDOCTOR: No. The sky is not the sky. The sky is canvas.\nHEX: We didn’t move at all, did we? When Ludo clicked his fingers. It never worked.\nDOCTOR: No. This is still his Celestial Toyroom.\nHEX: So - out there, beyond that fire, there’s just white?\nDOCTOR: The Toymaker’s world is one of infinite possibilities. An empty dimension in which his will can fashion matter from nothingness.\nHEX: So he didn’t whisk us all to Earth, he just recreated the clinic inside the Toymaker’s world.\nDOCTOR: A whole dimension, reconfigured into one building and its grounds.\nHEX: But how could Ludo do all that on his own?\nDOCTOR: He didn’t. I’m responsible for some of it. Or my unconscious is. This is one of my own traps — I just don’t know how it works.\nHEX: It works on electricity. Once all this was set up, we settled into the routine. Me and Ace stayed in the attic. Ludo made sure everybody got enough volts to keep them ignorant. Every day you and Queenie would come in on the cable car. Every day Herbert and Lola would do the same. Then you and Queenie would try to solve the mystery of who killed Dr Black.\nDOCTOR: And who did kill Dr Black?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 125\nHEX: Nobody. You were Dr Black. In the treatment room, with the ECT machine, giving yourself convulsions until your memory was blank. Every day you came, worked a bit out, and then had it wiped away by the machine. Then we stuck you back on the cable car and waited for you to arrive again.\nDOCTOR: Hex, there’s someone out there in the snow. Running away from the fire.\nHEX: Who is it?\nDOCTOR: It’s Queenie. It’s Queenie Glasscock. And Ace.\nHEX: We’d better go down and meet them.\nDOCTOR: Absolutely. Perhaps they have a Plan B.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 126\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 49: INT. BALLROOM\nDUMMY: I wouldn’t say this town was small, but the...\nLOLA: Road signs are back to back.\nDUMMY: Lady goes into the greengrocers in the pouring rain. Asks for five pounds of onions. Says the greengrocer, “Are you pickling?”\nLOLA: “No, it’s my umbrella!”\nDUMMY: Who won the Irish woodcutting competition?\nLOLA: Tree fellers from Dublin.\nDUMMY: Didn’t she do well? Now, Harry and Herbert. What happened? Those were your own jokes. That was your own material.\nHARRY: And we've all been here long enough for Miss Lola to learn it all.\nHERBERT: Lovely timing, dear.\nHARRY: They’d love her at the Glasgow Empire, wouldn’t they? A funny German.\nHERBERT: A novelty act.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 127\nLOLA: Herbert, you didn’t even try.\nHERBERT: Don’t worry, Lola. It’s not such a tragedy.\nHARRY: You see, in 1914, I joined up. Went to France. Oh, I was dead patriotic in those days. Not like my brother.\nHERBERT: Got the white feathers. So then I went. To be with my brother. And it was hell.\nHARRY: We’re twins, Miss Luna. But we’re not alike in every way.\nHERBERT: You see, on my first leave back in Blighty I met a doctor ina room in the Regent Palace Hotel.\nHARRY: He had a little syringe.\nHERBERT: Synovitis. One little prick and it was all over. The Great War. Unfit for service.\nHARRY: You’ve given us a second chance. A chance to go over the top together.\nHERBERT: Old comics never die, do they?\nHARRY: No. We just fade away.\nHARRY: (FX: AS HARRY SPEAKS HIS WORDS FADE OUT WITH A SPOOKY SOUND EFFECT, WHICH IS IN TURN DROWNED OUT BY THE SOUND OF THE TARDIS MATERIALISING. )\nLOLA: What is that?\nDUMMY: Ah! I was wondering when she’d turn up. I knew she was locked away inside someone’s head. Clever trick that — though I’ve seen it done before. Poor Harry. Wasn’t really the man for the job, was he?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 128\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 50: INT. THE GARDEN\nHEX: Ace!\nDOCTOR: Queenie! This way! You’1ll be fine once you reach the snow! (TO HEX) Amazing piece of work, isn’t it? A cyclorama wrapping up this building at the mountain peak. Some sky, some trees, some snow.\nHEX: There won’t be much left soon.\nACE: (ARRIVING) Finished wrecking everything, have you?\nHEX: Drop it, Ace.\nDOCTOR: Me wrecking everything! You’re the one who set fire to the sky.\nQUEENIE: That was me, actually, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Well whoever it was, it’s revealed something very useful.\nACE: What? That you’ve screwed everything up?\nQUEENIE: That we are not in Switzerland. We’re not even in the Alps.\nDOCTOR: That we’ve all failed. That this trap for the Toymaker has been turned into a trap for us. If it was ever ours to set.\nHEX: But the Toymaker lost. We saw it. Playing cards everywhere and him doing Jolson hands. We saw him break into pieces.\nDOCTOR: So what’s his game?\nQUEENIE: Daddy would know.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 129\nDOCTOR: Your daddy watched someone push you off the games room balcony, then played a game of Happy Families.\nQUEENIE: I know. But I’m here, aren’t I?\nDOCTOR: For the moment. But maybe none of us will be — after our next move. Right, Hex, Ace, Queenie. You want to hear Plan B? I’m afraid it’s terribly dangerous.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 130\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 51: INT. GAMES ROOM\nLOLA: What should I do with these, Toymaker?\nDUMMY: Put them in the box with the other toy soldiers.\nLOLA: Poor little boys. I’1l look after you. Put you out on Armistice Day.\nSWAPNIL: How do you feel now, Lola?\nLOLA: Alright. I suppose.\nDUMMY: Cheer up, Lola. Think what you’1ll be able to do when you've won.\nLOLA: Someone’s coming through the French windows.\nSWAPNIL: Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Hello, everyone... I see you’ve brought back the TARDIS. Inside Harry’s mind, wasn’t it? What a party trick! How permeable everybody’s head is here...\nSWAPNIL: Queenie, where have you been?\nQUEENIE: Setting fire to the sky, father. I just struck a match and up it went. Can you smell the burning paint? It was all a trick. We're not in Switzerland at all.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I worked it all out. We’re still in the Celestial Toyroom and I claim my prize.\nDUMMY: What prize?\nDOCTOR: The right to play the next game.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 131\nSWAPNIL: But it was Queenie who worked it out.\nDOCTOR: Err, well, yes.\nSWAPNIL: The reward is hers.\nQUEENIE: Are you sure, Daddy?\nDUMMY: Very well. You will play Miss Lola.\nDOCTOR: No, I forbid it!\nDUMMY: Oh do stop it. What about a round of sudden death?\nQUEENIE: Actually we were hoping for something a bit more protracted.\nLOLA: How do you play?\nDUMMY: You stand there, Miss Luna. And Mrs Glasscock, you stand there. Either side of my little robot. Who will then start the clock.\nDUMMY: And we listen. To this.\nDUMMY: The sound of you hearts beating.\nQUEENIE: The tin man has a heart?\nDUMMY: No. That’s yours, Mrs Glasscock...\nDUMMY: And that, Miss Luna, is yours.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 132\nLOLA: But what’s the game?\nDUMMY: The winner is the person with the slowest heart beat. All you have to do is relax, and the prize is yours.\nDOCTOR: Relax? In this situation? Look, Toymaker, why don’t you let me do this? I have two hearts. Much more interesting.\nDUMMY: But not fair. And the contest must be fair.\nSWAPNIL: Who is it?\nDUMMY: It’s Mrs Glasscock. Which means for you, Miss Luna, it’s sudden death.\nLOLA: Toymaker, no, I...\nDOCTOR: How can this be fair, Toymaker — Lola has a lung condition!\nDUMMY: Give us a song as you go. While I sit on Mrs Glasscock’s knee.\nLOLA: No.\nDUMMY: You don’t have a choice, dear. Whistle.\nLOLA: I’m so lonely here my darling. Can’t you see it in my eyes? Cut the cards again, darling...\nDUMMY: . Let me be the prize!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 133\nQUEENIE: It seems I’m the new winner. Oh, this is strange. It’s as if my senses have been suddenly sharpened. Like...\nDUMMY: Like being well again, after a period of illness.\nQUEENIE: Yes, exactly.\nDUMMY: Let’s put Lola in the box, shall we? Thank you. So, Queenie, whom do you challenge now?\nDOCTOR: Choose me, Queenie, and we could still make this work.\nQUEENIE: I choose you, Daddy.\nSWAPNIL: Lie*s only right.\nQUEENIE: And the game?\nSWAPNIL: There is only one choice. Chess.\nSWAPNIL: What’s the matter with your metal friend, little dummy?\nDUMMY: Someone’s in the attic. Attacking the robot’s power supply.\nDOCTOR: That’1ll be Ace and Hex. Oh dear, Toymaker. I don’t suppose you’re quite powerful enough to be in two places at once?\nDUMMY: No need, Doctor. They will not succeed. Before they can do any serious damage, the robot will have reached them. And then they will wish they had played by the rules.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 134\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 52: INT. THE ATTIC\nACE: It’s no good just pressing the buttons. We need to start hitting this with something. Break it properly.\nHEX: What about hitting it with this?\nACE: A baseball bat?\nHEX: Why not?\nACE: Baseball’s a sport, not a game.\nHEX: This computer bank is as hard as rock.\nACE: That bat, Hex, let me have a look it.\nHEX: What are you going to do?\nACE: Just look at it.\nROBOT: (FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR) Open this door!\nHEX: Do we really have time for this?\nACE: Hex, this is my bat. My bat from school. The stickers on the handle. I put those there. If the Doctor and Ludo created this world together, what’s this doing here? Neither of them have ever seen it.\nHEX: I just thought of something horrible.\nROBOT: (OFF) Open it!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 135\nACE: What?\nHEX: What if the Doctor’s wrong and we’re not outside the game? What if the Toymaker’s in our heads, too? What if we helped to create this world?\nACE: Maybe that’s not such a horrible thought. Maybe that means we can play a little game of our own.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 136\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 53: INT. BALLROOM\nDUMMY: Your chessmen are lovely work, Swapnil, they really are.\nSWAPNIL: Thank you. I carved them all myself.\nQUEENIE: Daddy, this is the right thing to do, isn’t it? I don’t want to be responsible for anything gruesome.\nSWAPNIL: No, Queenie, really, it’s fine.\nDOCTOR: Toymaker, how is Queenie going to play this game with you sitting on her knee?\nDUMMY: I shall sit here. On the Umpire’s chair. Queenie, put me in position, would you?\nDOCTOR: Don’t you feel a little vulnerable up there?\nDUMMY: Not at all. Queenie now controls what once belonged to Mrs Kniddel, to Harry, Herbert and Lola. If she wins this game, well, she’ll go up to a whole new level. And I’1l go with her.\nSWAPNIL: Now, Queenie, I’m thinking Nuremberg, 1906. Speilmann’s opening move against Przepiorka.\nQUEENIE: Pawn to E4?\nSWAPNIL: Yes. (FX: PUSHING GIANT CHESSPIECE)\nDUMMY: To begin a game by exposing the king? Not an opening gambit that I would favour.\nQUEENIE: (FX: PUSHING GIANT CHESSPIECE) I’1l bring my pawn forward to meet yours, Daddy.\nDOCTOR: And out comes your bishop, eh, Swapnil? (FX: SWAPNIL PUSHING\nGIANT: CHESSPIECE )\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 137\nQUEENIE: That’s right. (FX: PUSHING GIANT CHESSPIECE) And here comes my queen’s bishop to meet it. Are two bishops enough for a synod, do you think?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 138\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 54: INT. ATTIC\nHEX: He’s almost through.\nACE: Okay. Paper. Pencils. That’s all we need. I’1l draw a grid.\nHEX: I hope you’re right about this.\nACE: Just do it. You going to be noughts or crosses?\nHEX: God, I don’t care. Noughts.\nACE: Right. Go on then.\nHEX: He’s in!\nROBOT: You have broken the rules.\nACE: Keep playing, Hex!\nHEX: There. It’s yours.\nHEX: (FX: THE ROBOT POWERS UP ITS GUNS.\nHEX: It’s going to shoot us, Ace.\nACE: Hex — I feel really weird. I mean, really, really weird —\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 139\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 55: INT. BALLROOM\nSWAPNIL: It was terrible weather that year in Nuremberg.\nQUEENIE: Rained all week.\nSWAPNIL: Mate in 26, wasn’t it?\nQUEENIE: You put me on your shoulders so I could see the final moves. That was wonderful.\nSWAPNIL: Not for the man sitting behind us. (FX: PUSHING GIANT CHESSPIECE; ANOTHER PIECE TOPPLED) White knight takes black bishop.\nQUEENIE: (FX: PUSHING GIANT CHESSPIECE; ANOTHER PIECE TOPPLED) And my pawn moves in for the kill. A footsoldier topples a knight.\nSWAPNIL: Were you there, Doctor, that day in Nuremberg?\nDOCTOR: I was supposed to be. My train was delayed. Anarchists on the line at Baden-Baden. Were you there, Toymaker?\nDUMMY: I think I was. Gazing down from here. I haven’t yet won that memory back. But it will come. I’1l have control of all my powers. Of conjuration and transportation. To be anywhere I desire. To have anything I want.\nDOCTOR: Why did you give up your powers?\nDUMMY: I wanted to feel what it was like to lose. Just for a little while.\nDOCTOR: And how does it feel?\nDUMMY: Ghastly. So now I’m cashing in my chips.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 140\nSWAPNIL: Here comes the white queen, my love. To take your bishop. (FX:\nPUSHING: GIANT CHESSPIECE; ANOTHER PIECE TOPPLED)\nQUEENIE: The rules must be obeyed, father. My pawn must now take your bishop. F4. (FX: PUSHING GIANT CHESSPIECE; ANOTHER PIECE\nTOPPLED: )\nDUMMY: These two are playing to save each other. From me. I win whatever the outcome.\nQUEENIE: Your bishop now threatens my king. So I must take that bishop.\nSWAPNIL: There goes the clergy. Good riddance to them.\nQUEENIE: Do you remember what you said when you were lifting me down, daddy?\nSWAPNIL: No, my love.\nQUEENIE: That game, you said, was a lesson in the art of sacrifice.\nDUMMY: A lesson you’re learning now, Mrs Glasscock. Mate in three, I think.\nSWAPNIL: He’s right, Queenie.\nDUMMY: You’ve won, Swapnil. But play the moves through. I will have my sport.\nDOCTOR: That’s the beauty of chess, isn’t it, Toymaker? There can only be one conclusion to this game. Swapnil has won. And yet he’s not quite the victor until the last move has been played and Queenie has conceded that her king is dead. In those moments, who knows what might happen?\nDUMMY: Nothing, Doctor. It’s time for Queenie to remove herself from the board and for me to take my place by Swapnil’s side. And share in his victory.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 141\nQUEENIE: What was that?\nDOCTOR: Ace and Hex. Dealing with your robot friend.\nDUMMY: Now Swapnil has won, I can retrieve the last pieces of myself from your minds. They cannot defeat me.\nDOCTOR: No. But the game isn’t over. Who controls your powers now? Queenie? Swapnil? You? I think that between them, your two players could easily make a tiny but important change to this world.\nDUMMY: Like what, Doctor?\nQUEENIE: Like flicking the switch that electrifies the chessboard.\nSWAPNIL: Now, Toymaker, we must both stand still. Or perish. Wood and flesh. They both burn. Do either of us dare to make the final move?\nACE: Right you lot!\nDOCTOR: A pleasure to see you, Ace. Hex.\nACE: We know how it works, now. All it took was a game of noughts and crosses and I got Hex’s slice of Toymaker. Out of his head and into mine.\nDOCTOR: You lost, then, Hex?\nHEX: Don’t I know it. I feel awful.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 142\nDOCTOR: But you’re not a little wooden doll.\nACE: So what do we do about the dummy?\nDOCTOR: You don’t need to do anything.\nQUEENIE: Daddy-!!! (SWOONS)\nHEX: They’ve vanished!\nACE: Grab her, Hex-!\nDOCTOR: Look. It’s snowing outside.\nHEX: (ASIDE) She’s right out of it —\nACE: Where’s Swapnil? And the Toymaker?\nDOCTOR: Just where they were. And where, I think, they will always be. It’s we who have moved.\nACE: Moved?\nDOCTOR: By Swapnil Khan. He had control of the Toymaker’s powers — just for a moment. And it was all he required.\nHEX: We’re in Switzerland. The mountains are back. The sky is back.\nDOCTOR: And how do you feel, Ace?\nACE: Fine. Normal. It’s gone, hasn’t it?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 143\nORDERLY: Mrs Glasscock?\nDOCTOR: Ah, an orderly. Don’t worry. Nothing’s wrong.\nHEX: She’s asleep. Don’t wake her up.\nORDERLY: Visiting time is over, you know.\nDOCTOR: Sorry, yes. We were just going. Weren’t we? Ace? Hex?\nORDERLY: Is that your box?\nDOCTOR: No, that’s Queenie’s.\nORDERLY: What about the one in the ballroom? Dirty great blue thing.\nACE: Oh yeah, that’s ours. We’1ll collect it on our way out.\nHEX: It’s snowing again.\nORDERLY: Never does anything else in this place. We’re cut off from the real world up here. Nothing can touch us. And the air is always clean.\nDOCTOR: Yes. You’re right. Hahlbruck’s the place to get well. We’1l be leaving on the morning train.\nHEX: What about Queenie?\nDOCTOR: I’1l pop in and see our friend again before we go. Put things right.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 144\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 56: INT. EMPTY TOYROOM\nSWAPNIL: Quiet, isn’t it?\nDUMMY: That’s how it will stay, since you won’t play.\nSWAPNIL: I’1ll not break my resolve. How long will the electricity last, do you think?\nDUMMY: A thousand billion years. Two thousand billion, perhaps. You’re better placed to say than I.\nSWAPNIL: Oh yes. I have your powers. Or I almost have them. And I will almost have them forever, I suspect.\nDUMMY: An eternal checkmate. The axe stayed above the head of the king. Until the end of time.\nSWAPNIL: Yes.\nDUMMY: You sent the Doctor and his friends back to Earth?\nSWAPNIL: Of course. I plucked you out of them first, though. You were right. Just like the bits in marmalade. And I sent them all to Hahlbruck. Back to the magic mountain.\nDUMMY: And your daughter, too?\nSWAPNIL: What survives of her.\nDUMMY: And Miss Luna and the rest?\nSWAPNIL: The whole box of dolls.\nDUMMY: It’s never happened before, but they might recover.\nSWAPNIL: If I shut my eyes I can see her. Am I imagining this?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 145\nDUMMY: No, Swapnil Khan.\nSWAPNIL: She’s sitting in her room. At Hahlbruck. She’s having a tea party.\nDUMMY: Yes, I can see her too. Those are our old friends, aren’t they?\nSWAPNIL: Yes.\nDUMMY: Is her mind quite gone?\nSWAPNIL: She’s forgotten the man from the Herne Hill velodrome.\nDUMMY: That’s something.\nSWAPNIL: Everybody’s there. Miss Luna. The Randalls. Ludo. Mrs Kniddel.\nDUMMY: The whole gang.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE MAGIC MOUSETRAP by Matthew Sweet (FINAL) Page 146\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 57: INT. QUEENIE’S ROOM\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: THE SOUNDS OF A GHOSTLY PARTY. SNATCHES OF VOICES.\nCLINKING: TEACUPS. STRANGE AND SPECTRAL. )\nLOLA: Whose turn next?\nHARRY: It was you, Herbert, wasn’t it?\nHERBERT: Not me, Harold old chum. Ludo?\nLUDO: No, I had CONQUEST on a triple word score.\nLOLA: Then it must be Mrs Kniddel.\nHARRY: Go on, Mrs K, show us what you’ve got.\nQUEENIE: They do like their games. Don’t they, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: How else should toys live?\nQUEENIE: Will they ever change?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know. Perhaps.\nQUEENIE: And my daddy?\nDOCTOR: Quite lost. Lost in a dream in world far beyond this one. And\nDOCTOR: that, Queenie, was his greatest victory.\nQUEENIE: You’re not leaving-?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Queenie. It’s time to put your dolls away.\nDOCTOR: THE END\nDOCTOR: 231163-15"
