You make your task with Elder Bones.\nNAYSMITH: Hello, Mrs Swanson.\nBEAUTY: Beauty, please. I keep saying. Mrs Swanson is so formal.\nPRETTY: (CONTINUING HIS TRAIN OF THOUGHT) And the task is a binding contract.\nNAYSMITH: (A MILD CURSE, LIKE ‘SAINTS ALIVE!’) Sweet luggage!

(CORRECTING HERSELF) Sorry, Beauty.\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 3\nBEAUTY: We’1ll not talk about that Business lot today.

But I admire your eagerness.\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 4\nELDER BONES: (TO ALL) Now, now. This is a big day for little Naysmith. And this is a big place for her to choose her future. This is a most special room. Our ancestors knew this, even when all this was a working spaceport. (DARKLY) Before the coming of the Wailer. (BACK TO NORMAL) Our ancestors knew the importance of tradition. They named this place after those traditions. They called it... “Customs”. Initiate?\nNAYSMITH: Sir.\nELDER BONES: You have been taught the Customs of Economy?\nNAYSMITH: Sir. I travel light, I have learned to live on little liquids.\nELDER BONES: As each of you reaches your twentieth year, so you make your decision. It’s been some time since I was twenty —\nELDER BONES: And in all my time here, I have seen much, I have guided many generations. But this is the day I most look forward to.

Bring your candle. Hold it high. Regard the paths behind me and the ancient writings above them. Two paths. Two choices. Decide now whether you are truly brave and wish to serve your people, or if you will forever be a passenger. Have you decided?\nNAYSMITH: I have, Elder Bones. I choose to serve my community.

All I’m saying is it would be nice to look out every now and then. Travelling through all of time and space and we haven’t even got a window.\nDOCTOR: (POINTING) And what exactly would you call that?\nMEL: (SIGHS) A scanner screen, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Well, there you are.\nMEL: And it’s shut.

Will my task help us all leave the spaceport?\nELDER BONES: We have many more steps before that glorious day.\nNAYSMITH: They say there’s a whole world outside.\nELDER BONES: Naysmith, let me ‘level with you’. The water situation is much worse than is generally known. We will soon have no choice but to take control of the hydroponics garden, and the water mills too.\nNAYSMITH: But Business occupy the gardens.\nELDER BONES: They do. And Business have the Wailer.\nNAYSMITH: I don’t know what I can do. Sir.\nELDER BONES: You’re young and fast and agile. Scout the Business garden, find where they are strongest and report back to me. We have such little time left, you must find us the way so that we can prepare to fight the Business.\nNAYSMITH: Yes, sir.\nELDER BONES: Look now, can you see along the walls there? That faint glow.\nNAYSMITH: Candles? No, something else.\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 8\nELDER BONES: Emergency strip lights will show you the way.

What’s happening? The soil farm buckled right in front of me. Burst one of the mills.\nGALPAN: It’s not just the soil farm. Everything’s straining — the whole garden. The whole spaceport, I shouldn’t be surprised. As if the storm is finally going to get through. Are you armed?\nROGERS: How do we fight a storm with a gun?\nGALPAN: Read the memos, Rogers. Director says Economy’s having another initiation. Last thing we need. Is your gun charged?\nROGERS: (CHECKING IT — A LITTLE HUM OF POWER) Enough. Four greens. We needed the trickle charge plates to power up the repair irons, I’m afraid.\nGALPAN: It’1ll do. (CHECKS HERS — A SIMILAR HUM) I’ve got five greens on mine. Now, circle the garden — make sure our people are safe. But be careful.\nROGERS: I won’t go near the vents, ma’am, I can tell you that.\nGALPAN: Circle quickly, let’s get the gardens secured and join the others.

I keep telling them: if we could just divert power to lights, we could see what’s going on.\nGALPAN: (SOTTO) Business has survived the darkness for centuries. We don’t need the light.

We apologise for the delay to your journey.\nDOCTOR: This should be one of the busiest spaceports in the galaxy, yet it seems completely deserted.\nMEL: Not completely. Someone turned on the lights for us.\nDOCTOR: That’s a little unexpected, I’1l admit. I’m not usually welcomed.\nMEL: Yes, I’ve learnt that.\nDOCTOR: People warm to me eventually. Most of the time.\nMEL: Of course they do, Doctor. I suppose the lights could have come on automatically. Shall we take a look around?\nDOCTOR: Seems rude not to now. This looks like Arrivals. If this Spaceport is still operational, there must be people around somewhere.\nMEL: There, for instance. Hello!\nNAYSMITH: (STARTLED) Oh! Who are you?\nNAYSMITH: Wait! The wall. A hole appeared in the wall! And it’s gone\nNAYSMITH: again. How did it go?\nMEL: (COMING FORWARD) I’m Mel, and this is the Doctor.\nNAYSMITH: Stay back, I haven’t done anything.\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 18\nMEL: Nor have we.\nNAYSMITH: Did... did you bring the summer?\nDOCTOR: I have been known to light up a room.\nMEL: (TO NAYSMITH) Usually with his coat of many colours.\nNAYSMITH: (STEPPING FORWARD TO LOOK) Yes, we make our clothes in the dark, too.\nDOCTOR: Charming.\nNAYSMITH: (TO DOCTOR AND MEL) The wall is opening again. Quickly! Hide!\nDOCTOR: I don’t hide. From whom should I hide?\nGALPAN: (AT DOOR) Us. My name is Galpan and this is Rogers. Are you Business or Economy?\nDOCTOR: Madam, I am always first class.\nMEL: He means ‘hello’! I’m Mel, this is —\nROGERS: First?

They like to make their killings look like accidents — but make no mistake, it’s merger.\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 20\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 10: INT. CORRIDOR 2\nGALPAN: Enough! (THE LASERS STOP) It’s pointless, Rogers. It’s not even scratching the surface. We may as well save the charge.\nROGERS: You realise what this means, don’t you, ma’am? All the lights, the sounds, everything is back. We’ve got power again! No ekeing out what we can pull from the garden systems — we can use the recharging plates as much as we like! Get all the guns fully powered.\nGALPAN: Quit it! (HE STOPS) This has happened before and it doesn’t last.\nROGERS: Not in my lifetime, ma’am — nor, I’1l warrant, in yours. Doesn’t it make you feel alive?\nGALPAN: My Granddad called it ‘Summer’. He never knew why the summer came back, he never knew why it left again. But he was really clear that it doesn’t last.\nROGERS: Can’t we stop it going? This is like being outside the spaceport, I don’t want to go back to the darkness.\nGALPAN: He said one other thing about Summer: it only happens when strangers arrive.\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 21\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 11: INT. ARRIVALS\nDOCTOR: (EXAMINING THE WALL) It’s not door, nor a shutter. It’s like the whole wall shut. But why, I wonder?\nMEL: To protect us?\nNAYSMITH: They say the walls breathe\nDOCTOR: Just ‘Doctor’, thanks. (FX\nMEL: What’s your name?\nNAYSMITH: Naysmith. I’m an Initiate.\nDOCTOR: in summer, Elder Doctor.\nDOCTOR: : TAPS WALL AGAIN)\nDOCTOR: (NOT INTERESTED) How interesting. (THINKING ALOUD) You know, I would have sworn this was a supporting structural wall. Which makes the fact that it moved a very singular one. But perhaps I’ve mis-remembered my spaceport design.\nMEL: Surely not.\nDOCTOR: There goes another wall. More and more singular.\nMEL: (TO NAYSMITH) Naysmith: who were those men?\nNAYSMITH: I said. They’re Business. first class?\nDOCTOR: (PROUD) I’m Economy.

Like an art installation. As if the walls were trying out new structures. New perspectives. This whole room has changed shape while we’ve been standing here.\nDOCTOR: And something’s gone missing.\nMEL: Missing?\nDOCTOR: There was a little control panel over there, like an information booth. It’s now on the other side of that wall.\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 23\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 12: INT.

Doctor.\nNAYSMITH: (TO MEL, URGENTLY) You’re supposed to bow your head.\nMEL: Oh, sorry. Yes.\nELDER BONES: (TO MEL) Your welcome is received, Mel.\nMEL: (HISSED) Now you, Doctor-!\nDOCTOR: I bow to no man, Mel. At least, not until I know enough to respect him. (TO ELDER BONES) Tell me, ‘Elder Bones’ — is it\nDOCTOR: you that’s moving these walls?\nELDER BONES: Not I, Doctor. The spaceport itself.\nMEL: The spaceport-—?\nANNOUNCEMENT: Welcome to Tantane Spaceport.\nDOCTOR: It does like to welcome us, doesn’t it?\nANNOUNCEMENT: We apologise for the delay in disabling your ship.\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 27\nMEL: What?\nANNOUNCEMENT: Anti-matter containment engines have been neutralised. Anti- gravity launch systems reversed.\nMEL: Doctor, does that mean us?\nDOCTOR: Hardly. The TARDIS doesn’t need anti-matter.\nANNOUNCEMENT: Physical restraining measures continue.\nDOCTOR: Now what are they, I wonder?\nELDER BONES: Alas, the ways of the spaceport are a mystery to me.\nANNOUNCEMENT: Physical restraint will be completed shortly. Thank you for your patience.\nMEL: I really think that means us. Could the walls be closing in to suffocate us?\nDOCTOR: This is a spaceport. A sealed environment. If that’s what it wanted, it could shut down the atmosphere. No, I think our arrival has tripped some other process. As to what it is, I couldn’t hazard a guess.\nDOCTOR: But it must be for a reason. Must be.\nMEL: (LOOKING) Yes, and I’ve just realised what it is!\nDOCTOR: Oh? Really?\nMEL: Look over there. The TARDIS has gone!\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 28\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 15: INT. CORRIDOR 2\nGALPAN: Look at this, Rogers! I think this is a map and these two small blue dots represent us, here at this panel.\nROGERS: Then I’1l bet you an audit I know what this button does...\nGALPAN: (SARCASTIC) Brilliant, Rogers, quite brilliant. Now there are hundreds of blue dots!\nROGERS: Don’t you see? It’s everybody. If this is us, then that’s got to be hydroponics and the business lounge. That’s where most of the blue dots are, because that’s where most of our people are.\nGALPAN: You’re right. And so those... (SHE INDICATES TWO BLOBS ON THE MAP) will be the strangers. Four dots. I thought there might be more of them.\nROGERS: Ma’am. There: what’s that?\nGALPAN: Economy, I shouldn’t wonder. All clustered together in a ball of cheap misery.\nROGERS: I don’t think so. That’s not a bunch of individual dots — that’s just one dot. One very big dot.\nGALPAN: The Wailer.\nROGERS: But it’s always been trapped at the Control Tower. What’s it doing sitting there?\nGALPAN: It’s not sitting, Rogers. It’s moving.\nROGERS: And so are Economy. Now where are they going to?\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 29\nGALPAN: It won’t be anywhere we like. Typical. Every chance they get, they take and take. No pitch, no buyout. They’re just like — like (SPITS) franchises.\nROGERS: If they keep going that way, they’1ll reach the Business Lounge.\nGALPAN: Boarding hell. (BEAT) Forget the strangers, we’ve got a job to do. Come on!\nGALPAN: (FX: THEY LEAVE. WALL BEGINS TO TURN, ROTATING CONTROL PANEL INTO...)\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 30\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 16: INT. ARRIVALS\nDOCTOR: This is an outrage. (CALLING) Spaceport! Spaceport! I demand you return my vessel to me at once!\nMEL: Doctor, look! That information booth’s come back!\nDOCTOR: An attempt to communicate, perhaps? (STEPPING TOWARDS IT; THE\nOTHERS: FOLLOW) Right, then...\nELDER BONES: You understand the control panels, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: In principle, certainly. Now, then... (FX: PANEL TONE)\nSCREEN VOICE: Welcome to Tantane Information System. Press for Restaurants, Tourist Guide or Business.\nNAYSMITH: (ALARM) Business!\nDOCTOR: No good to us. (THINKS) Let’s try this little envelope: ‘Sent Messages’. (FX: PANEL TONE)\nNAYSMITH: Is there anything I can do?\nDOCTOR: Watch and learn. (FX: PANEL BLEEP) A-ha! ‘Retrieve messages’. (A BLEEP) Ooh, a video attachment! And... ‘Play video’.\nDOCTOR: (FX: PANEL TONE — THEN, OVER SCREEN, WITH SCREAMS AND CRIES OF\nTERRIFIED: PASSENGERS IN B/G:)\nMAD PASSENGER: (TERRIFIED, OVER SCREEN) It’s here. The Wailer is here!\nNAYSMITH: Oh, my lights.\nMAD PASSENGER: (TERRIFIED, OVER SCREEN) If you receive this message, don’t let Earth send help! You can’t land here, you mustn’t land [here] — NO!!!\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 31\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: START OF WAILER SCREECH [SEE LATER] — CUT OFF BY FUZZ OF STATIC. MESSAGE CUTS OUT)\nDOCTOR: That’s it. The last message sent from this booth. When was that, I wonder...?\nMEL: Horrible. Just before the end, I saw a flash of something grey. Something with teeth. Was that...?\nNAYSMITH: (FEARFUL) The Wailer.\nELDER BONES: It lives in the Tower, now. It guards Control.\nDOCTOR: Control? You mean the spaceport’s Control Tower?\nELDER BONES: When the spaceport first went dark, we managed to drive the Wailer back, trap it at the Tower. Many of our people died in the process.\nMEL: Well, let’s not go there then. (BEAT) Doctor? (BEAT) Oh, terrific: we’re going to have to, aren’t we?\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid so.\nMEL: Well then, let’s see if we can’t get a map on this thing. Budge up, Doctor.\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 32\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 17: INT. CORRIDOR 3\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: CORRIDOR 3 IS ANOTHER NARROW ONE BUT VERY LONG WITH\nSEVERAL DOORS ALONG THE WAY: THINK OF THE TWISTING ROUTE YOU GO\nFROM: AIRCRAFT TO BAGGAGE RECLAIM, WITH SOME UP-AND-DOWN\nCLIMBING: TOO. ROGERS AND GALPAN RUNNING THROUGH )\nGALPAN: This way, Rogers! There’s a cut-through to the Business Lounge those Economy types won’t know [about —]\nROGERS: (STOPPING) What was that?\nGALPAN: (STOPPING) Nothing. Keep going.\nROGERS: It was the Wailer, wasn’t it? It’s on the move!\nGALPAN: Then we’d best not stand here waiting for it to find us. Come\nGALPAN: on!\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 33\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 18: INT. ARRIVALS\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: THE SAME WAILER CRY, DISTORTED THROUGH ONE MORE WALL,\nCONTINUING THROUGH: )\nDOCTOR: I’m almost afraid to say it, but that sounded rather like a wail.\nNAYSMITH: I haven’t heard that since I was Carry-On.\nELDER BONES: One doesn’t easily forget the Wailer.\nMEL: I’ve got a map up. Right — if that’s us in Arrivals and that’s the Control Tower. Wait a minute: that’s miles away.\nDOCTOR: Five miles, from the look of that scale.\nMEL: That sound’s not coming from five miles away!\nELDER BONES: So — it’s finally clear of the Tower. After all these years. But how?\nNAYSMITH: Business! They’ve got the Summer, now they want to take the whole spaceport. They’ve let it out!\nDOCTOR: (TO MEL) Mel, does the map show how the walls have moved? Can you work out where the TARDIS is?\nMEL: I think it’s just showing rooms, not the dividing walls inside them. It’s not labelled very well. What’s “BR” mean?\nNAYSMITH: Baggage Reclaim. Those dots must be Economy!\nDOCTOR: Yes, and I’m guessing that rather large dot between them and us must be this ‘Wailer’.\nNAYSMITH: We’ve got to warn them! (FX: WAIL AGAIN. CROSS TO: )\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 34\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 19: INT. CORRIDOR 3\nGALPAN: Rogers, wait.\nROGERS: (STOPPING) I thought you said not to hang around?\nGALPAN: More haste, less speed. Everything looks so different in the light. We could run the wrong way — straight into the Wailer.\nROGERS: Then let’s just run from the sound. With any luck it’1ll find Economy first.\nGALPAN: You don’t mean that. No one deserves to meet the Wailer — not even Economy.\nROGERS: Economy brought that thing here. They deserve everything they get.\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 35\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 20: INT. ARRIVALS\nMEL: This is amazing. So much more than just a You Are Here display. This computer seems to have information on everything! It’s the most advanced system I’ve ever seen.\nDOCTOR: Yes, well — computer archaeology was never my strong suit.\nNAYSMITH: (READING) “Must-See Tantane Music Festival”. What’s that?\nDOCTOR: Just a tourist guide to the planet outside. Fascinating, no doubt, but not a great deal of use just at present.\nNAYSMITH: (WITH REVERENCE) Outside! I’ve always wanted to know what’s outside.\nMEL: You mean you don’t know?\nDOCTOR: What are these blobs here.\nNAYSMITH: Business. Congregated around the hydroponics garden, and the area they call Business Lounge.\nDOCTOR: But no TARDIS — and no sliding walls. So the map doesn’t show everything. Naysmith, Elder Bones — Mel and I need to get to the Control Tower to free our vessel, the TARDIS. We could use a little local knowledge.\nELDER BONES: You want us to show you the route? Certainly. Naysmith?\nNAYSMITH: We're here, you see? (FX: BLEEP) My initiation was there in Customs. (FX: BLEEP) Then beyond that there’s Baggage Reclaim. (FX: BLEEP) Mel, can you pull the map across?\nMEL: Um — (FX: TONE) — yes, got it.\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 36\nNAYSMITH: I don’t know what these sections are (FX: BLEEP) but those (FX: BLEEP) are Immigration and Security. More parts I don’t know. Pull again. (FX: TONE) Right there, that’s the spaceport perimeter. And right at the end, up three levels, that’s the Control Tower.\nELDER BONES: No-one has been to the Tower in four hundred years.\nMEL: Because of this ‘Wailer’?\nDOCTOR: Four hundred years? No wonder it’s escaped: it must be lonely. Time we took a stroll, Mel.\nELDER BONES: The walkways might be on. But it’s miles across the spaceport. Most doors are closed. And you have to get by Business just to reach the central complex.\nANNOUNCEMENT: Welcome to Tantane Spaceport. Low power warning.\nMEL: Five miles.\nDOCTOR: A good stretch of the legs. Elder Bones, how long will the power hold?\nELDER BONES: Sixty years ago, strangers arrived and brought the summer with them, just as you have. It lasted two hours.\nMEL: How long have we been here?\nDOCTOR: Not very long. But let’s hurry. I don’t want to be stuck here when all the power goes off again. We’d be trapped in whatever room we happened to be. And without power, we’d never get the walls to move back and free the TARDIS.\nNAYSMITH: There is always power for the hydroponics system.\nELDER BONES: But we’ve never been able to divert it to the lights or the doors.\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 37\nANNOUNCEMENT: Welcome to Tantane Spaceport.\nMEL: I’d give real money if it’d stop saying that.\nANNOUNCEMENT: Warning. Containment system requirements exceed reserve battery power. We apologise for the disruption to your quarantine. Systems will go to sleep in a few moments to preserve the security constructs.\nELDER BONES: It’s the end of the summer.\nDOCTOR: I thought you said two hours?\nMEL: I take it back, Doctor. Sometimes it’s nice to travel without seeing what’s around you.\nANNOUNCEMENT: (FX: FLICKERS) Welcome to Tantane Spaceport. Power failing.\nMEL: We’re losing the lights.\nDOCTOR: Without power to the doors, we’re not going to make it out of\nDOCTOR: Arrivals!\nANNOUNCEMENT: Welcome to Tantane Spaceport. There is one arrival. (LOSING POWER) There are no departuuuuuuures. (FX: EVERYTHING DEAD)\nELDER BONES: Summer is ended.\nMEL: Doctor...? Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Sorry, Mel. Looks like it’s time to check out.\nDOCTOR: END OF PART ONE\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 38"

Show me the respect you were taught.\nNAYSMITH: Yes, sir.\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 45\nMEL: (SOTTO) Did you hear that, Doctor? Five hundred!\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) Indeed. I’d assumed ‘Elder’ was just another word for ‘statesman’, but it seems longevity may be the primary factor. I wonder whether he’s the only one here who’s lived that long?\nMEL: (FINDING DOOR KNOB; ALOUD) Got it! I’ve found the emergency override thingy!\nELDER BONES: (COMING OVER) Excellent work, young lady. Show me.\nDOCTOR: Where was it, Mel?\nMEL: Right at the top corner. Strange place for a door knob — unless you’re seven foot tall.\nDOCTOR: It’s not for members of the public, Mel: it’s for maintenance crews. Automatics are switched off when any repairs are being done, so they need a manual override.\nELDER BONES: (THOUGHTFUL) You know how all this works.\nDOCTOR: Well, when you’ve been around as long as I have, you tend to pick this kind of stuff up. Mel, press on the pad and keep your hand there. The spaceport will ignore anything that could be an accidental touch, especially if it’s trying to save power. But it should respond to a positive press.\nMEL: Here goes...!\nMEL: Ta-dah!\nNAYSMITH: (AWE) With the right touch, you can open doors!\nDOCTOR: You know, that’s the oddest-sounding storm.\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 46\nELDER BONES: Doctor? The Tower is this way.\nMEL: Only that’s not where we’re going.\nDOCTOR: It isn’t?\nMEL: No. We’re just going to nip into Duty Free first.\nDOCTOR: Mel?!\nMEL: (LEADING THE WAY) Come along. You too, Naysmith, Elder Bones!\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 47\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 26: INT. CORRIDOR 1\nPRETTY: (BITTER) The whole of Economy and they’ve got Nothing to Declare. Cowards! They’d rather sit tight, than take action.\nBEAUTY: People remember how Elder Bones has protected us from Business. Of course they’re going to want to wait for him.\nPRETTY: But what if Business have got him, Mum? And Naysmith, too.\nBEAUTY: They’re scared, Pretty. They’ve lived in twilight for years. But this dark, it’s like nothing they’ve known before.\nPRETTY: And I told them, the dark will pass! I bet Business would’ve volunteered. Say this for them, they get things done —\nBEAUTY: So do we!\nPRETTY: Mum, go back. If Economy won’t help us, they won’t help themselves either. They’1l need you.\nBEAUTY: (SLIGHTLY PUZZLED) You talk as if you’re not Economy. We stick together. (BRIGHTLY) Now, how about we try Baggage Reclaim?\nPRETTY: All right, mother. Baggage Reclaim first, then the Control Tower.\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 48\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 27: INT. DUTY FREE\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: A SILENT DUTY FREE. IN THE QUIET, WE HEAR A LITTLE SCUTTLE & MUTTER, AS OF A LARGE SPIDER-LIKE CREATURE. BEAT. DOOR SLIDES OPEN)\nMEL: (WALKING IN; DOCTOR, NAYSMITH & ELDER BONES BEHIND) Yes, this must be it: Duty Free! Come on! (WALKS INTO A GIANT COBWEB) Yeuch! Cobwebs. Why is it always cobwebs?\nDOCTOR: Never underestimate the survival power of the simple arachnid, Mel. Why I once visited an entire planet [of]-\nMEL: (INTERRUPTING) Later, Doctor. Okay?\nELDER BONES: Why are we even here? Duty Free was raided the moment the Spaceport went into lockdown: there’s nothing for us here.\nNAYSMITH: It must’ve been very frightening.\nDOCTOR: The food may have gone, but man does not live by bread alone. Now, what have here? (FX: FEELING AROUND COUNTER) Books, pens, T-shirts — rather cheap ones by the feel of them. Aha!\nMEL: What is it? What have you found?\nDOCTOR: A cat.\nMEL: A cat?!\nDOCTOR: Yes, a very fluffy one. Here, catch!\nMEL: What! (DOING SO) Oh, a cuddly toy! Very funny. Ha ha.\nDOCTOR: Never underestimate a cuddly toy, Mel. Once we can see properly, we can look at its label. It might have a date of manufacture on it. Always useful to know when we are.\nNAYSMITH: It’s the Year of Elder Bones, Four Hundred and Nine.\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 49\nDOCTOR: ‘The Year of Elder Bones’? I must admit to feeling a trifle jealous. I’ve always hankered for a chronology named after me.\nELDER BONES: It was an honour bestowed by the new order.\nMEL: Five hundred years. You’ve really been here all that time?\nDOCTOR: So what is 409 E-B in Galactic Standard?\nELDER BONES: In Earth years it is Sixty-one, twenty-seven.\nMEL: Back on the shelf with you, kitty. No need to peek at your label now.\nNAYSMITH: That man on the recording, he mentioned Earth. Where is it?\nMEL: In range of a distress call, hopefully.\nDOCTOR: So that’s why you brought us here! You were hoping we’d find communications equipment.\nMEL: Radios, telephones — anything like that, really. Even if we can’t contact Earth, we might be able to speak to someone else in the spaceport.\nDOCTOR: Mel’s right. Spread out and scout round.\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 50\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 28: INT. CORRIDOR 3\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: DISTANT ROAR OF THE WAILER. ROGERS AND GALPAN INCHING THEIR WAY ALONG)\nROGERS: It sounds like it’s behind us now.\nGALPAN: Impossible. It can’t have moved that quickly. This is the longest single-run corridor on the spaceport, Rogers. If the Wailer were onto us, we’d know by now.\nROGERS: Would we? I don’t know anything anymore. How did it get out in the first place? And why today and not yesterday — or tomorrow?\nGALPAN: Are you serious? Summer. (BEAT.) Summer came and it only lasted ten minutes. Then something stopped it, switched it back off.\nROGERS: The strangers.\nGALPAN: What with the storm, it’s all become too much for the spaceport to cope with. Strained the systems. Presumably whatever force was containing the Wailer switched off or weakened. And this is the result.\nROGERS: It is behind us! I knew it!\nGALPAN: Nonsense. I'll show you. This corridor runs straight, all the\nGALPAN: way back to the stairs. So if I fire my gun back where we've come from...\nGALPAN: See.\nROGERS: Boarding hell, it’s there! How far back, d’you reckon?\nGALPAN: I’m not waiting to find out. Run!\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 51\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 29: INT. DUTY FREE\nMEL: (TRYING TO STOP A GLASS PANEL FROM SLIDING) No, no, no!\nDOCTOR: (COMING OVER ACROSS BROKEN GLASS) Mel? Are you all right?\nMEL: I’m fine. I was trying to open this display cabinet, when the glass lid slid onto the floor.\nDOCTOR: Tut, tut. Such wanton vandalism.\nMEL: All right, all right. I’m already feeling guilty about it. (REACHING INTO CABINET) Anyway, this is what I was after. (RETRIEVES IT) It caught my eye.\nDOCTOR: Caught your eye? Well at least that means your eyesight’s returning.\nMEL: (SURPRISED) Oh, yes. How about yours?\nDOCTOR: Oh, I’ve been able to see for the last ten minutes. I just didn’t want to brag about it.\nMEL: How uncharacteristically modest of you. Anyway, what do you reckon to this? Looks like a sort of mini-computer.\nDOCTOR: Show me. (TAKES IT) Hmm. Looks like a Handheld. I haven’t seen one of these in centuries.\nMEL: A Handheld?\nDOCTOR: It’s a sort of glorified Executive toy.\nNAYSMITH: Executive-? But that’s a Business thing!\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 52\nELDER BONES: (COMING OVER) I once had a Handheld — good for playing games with your friends, booking hotels and ordering books. Useless for helping us get to the Control Tower!\nDOCTOR: This is far from useless, Elder Bones. All those applications you just mentioned have one thing in common, don’t they?\nMEL: They’re all means of communication!\nDOCTOR: Exactly. No one’s planning on setting a new record at Tetris, Elder Bones. (FIDDLING) But if we can get a message out on this thing — call for help — then it’s worth its weight in — Ah!\nDOCTOR: (FX: A FLICK OF AN ON SWITCH AND A POP OF POWER — THAT\nIMMEDIATELY: FIZZLES OUT)\nIMMEDIATELY: Oh.\nMEL: Dead battery?\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid so. (DEFEATED) Perhaps it was too much to hope for.\nMEL: Don’t give up, Doctor. Look around you. We’re in Duty Free: Home of the Battery.\nDOCTOR: You’re right! All of you, search the shelves. We need batteries, or a charger, a solar panel — anything!\nMEL: Solar, that’s a thought. Doctor, why aren’t there any windows in this spaceport?\nDOCTOR: (SIGHS) Mel, you are obsessed with windows! When we get out of this, I promise I will take you to a glazier.\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 53\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 30: INT. STARTRAIN PLATFORM/CORRIDOR 3\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: STARTRAIN PLATFORM LEADS OFF CORRIDOR 3: IT’S SMALLER, AT\nRIGHT: ANGLES TO 3 AND GIVES ROGERS AND GALPAN COVER)\nGALPAN: (RUNNING) In here, Rogers! Quick!\nROGERS: Where are we?\nGALPAN: The StarTrain platform!\nROGERS: StarTrain? What’s the [StarTrain—? ]\nROGERS: (HUSHED) Ma’am — I think I’ve trodden in something.\nGALPAN: (HUSHED) A spider, I expect. This place is covered in cobwebs. Stay here.\nROGERS: Wait — where are you going?\nGALPAN: (FX: FOLLOW HER) I’m just going back to peek back around the corner, see if I can spot the Wailer.\nROGERS: (OFF) Be careful!\nGALPAN: Shield your eyes...\nGALPAN: (FX: SHE FIRES ONE BLAST DOWN THE CORRIDOR. BEAT. THEN AN\nEXPLOSION: AS SHE HITS SOMETHING. THE EXPLOSION CATCHES THE WAILER... WHICH WAILS, OFF)\nROGERS: (OFF) Did you hit it?\nGALPAN: No. One of the vending machines, I think. It blew up right in front of the Wailer.\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 54\nROGERS: (OFF) So now’s our chance to run, right?\nGALPAN: Wrong. Now’s our chance to kill it. Get over here, Rogers, and start blasting!\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 55\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 31: INT. DUTY FREE\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: FUSILLADE OF SHOTS IN FAR DISTANCE — GALPAN’S GUN JOINED BY ROGERS’ )\nNAYSMITH: I hear shooting!\nDOCTOR: I expect it’s our friends with the guns. Keep looking for batteries.\nMEL: At least we know they’re a good way off.\nMEL: (FX: DOOR SLIDES OPEN. THE SOUND OF EXPLOSIONS AND FIRING GETS\nBRIEFLY: LOUDER)\nELDER BONES: (WONDERMENT) It works. The emergency override works. So easy when you know how.\nDOCTOR: Thinking of going somewhere, Elder Bones?\nELDER BONES: (CAUGHT OUT) What? No, I —\nDOCTOR: Then stop activating the doors. Every door that we open is burning up power — power that this spaceport seems to need for something else. Are you quite sure you don’t know what that something else is?\nELDER BONES: All I want is to get to the Control Tower. Like you, Doctor.\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 56\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 32: INT. STARTRAIN PLATFORM/CORRIDOR 3\nROGERS: Did we get it?\nGALPAN: Wait. Listen.\nROGERS: I really thought we’d killed it.\nGALPAN: Sounds wounded, though.\nROGERS: Let’s go finish it. (HE STARTS TO HEAD OFF)\nGALPAN: No, Rogers — no. Right now, it’s injured and that’s good. Slows it down, keeps us safe. We go right up to its throat and we might not live to tell the tale.\nROGERS: We’re just going to leave it there-?\nGALPAN: For now. Climb down onto the track. We’1ll follow the Startrain back to the Business Lounge. It’s time for a strategy meeting.\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 57\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 33: INT. DUTY FREE\nNAYSMITH: Mel, Doctor, are these your ‘batteries’?\nDOCTOR: Let me see.\nNAYSMITH: They look like tiny suitcases trapped in a kind of transparent skin.\nDOCTOR: Perfect! Still in their shrinkwrapping. Good work, Naysmith. Now — who’s got good fingernails?\nMEL: Hand them over!\nDOCTOR: (CALLING) Elder Bones, what did I tell you about using up power?\nELDER BONES: I will not be long. I’m just going to... to scout ahead.\nMEL: (SUSPICIOUS) Scout ahead?\nDOCTOR: Didn’t sound terribly convincing, did it?\nNAYSMITH: It will be alright, I think. No-one knows the spaceport better than Elder Bones.\nMEL: There, that’s it! (FITTING BATTERIES INTO HANDHELD) Now — plus this way, minus that. And... (MAC-LIKE ON SOUND) power on!\nDOCTOR: Good work, Mel.\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 58\nNAYSMITH: Amazing. It’s like a little summer, lighting up your whole face.\nDOCTOR: Holographic display. Rather crude as a torch goes, but it’ll do.\nNAYSMITH: We should take it to Elder Bones. It can help us find the way to the Control Tower.\nDOCTOR: Yes, your ‘Elder Bones’. You say he’s five hundred years old, but you’re, what —\nNAYSMITH: Twenty.\nDOCTOR: Twenty. Do all the Economy people live as long as Elder Bones? You haven’t all been here for centuries, have you?\nNAYSMITH: Elder Bones has guided and protected nineteen generations since Business brought the Wailer here and trapped us all. My people are strong because of Elder Bones and he leads Economy, he is all that is good in Economy, and we must respect him.\nMEL: Doesn’t mean you have to like him.\nNAYSMITH: (GENUINE CONFUSION) Doesn’t it?\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 59\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 34: INT. STARTRAIN PLATFORM\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: STARTRAIN IS FROM JFK AIRPORT’S AIRTRAIN: SMALL LITTLE STATION-LIKE CORRIDORS ARE CONNECTED BY RAILED TUNNELS. ROGERS AND GALPAN ARE BETWEEN STATIONS AND HURRYING AS BEST THEY CAN)\nGALPAN: We’re about halfway between stations, I reckon. Not much further. How’re you bearing up, Rogers? You’ve not said much Since we left the platform.\nROGERS: Sorry. It’s just I’m not overly fond of Strat Meets, ma’am. I can never think of a strategy.\nGALPAN: You don’t have to. The good thing about a Strat is that it’s official — and ‘official’ means that the Director comes. About time he made an appearance. I don’t see why we have to be customer-facing all the time when he’s living it up somewhere client-side.\nROGERS: That’s a bit strong, isn’t it, ma’am. If it weren’t for the Director, we‘d’ve lost the spaceport to Economy by now. (HE STUMBLES) Woah!\nGALPAN: Watch your feet, Rogers. The rails are a bit uneven here. We\nGALPAN: must be under Duty Free right now.\nROGERS: Duty free! Can you imagine? Free of any duties. Paradise.\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 60\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 35: INT. DUTY FREE\nMEL: Game... game... game. Oh, what’s this?\nMEL: (FX: PRESSES A BUTTON. ALIEN POP MUSIC STARTS PLAYING LOUDLY — A BIT ASIAN ROCK)\nNAYSMITH: What a terrible noise!\nMEL: Sorry! Bit of a racket.\nDOCTOR: Racket? That was a Balinese Pentachord!\nMEL: Whatever it was, it wasn’t what we’re looking for. Oh, I give up! There’s no communication software on this thing.\nDOCTOR: What we need... is a game with a high-score table.\nMEL: What?\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 61\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 36: INT. CORRIDOR 3\nBEAUTY: (FX: WALKING TO HALT) I’m beginning to see again. That sign, up ahead, Pretty. What’s it say? (READING) “StarTrain”. What’s that?\nPRETTY: An old passenger transport, Dad said. There are loads of platforms.\nBEAUTY: Transport!\nPRETTY: Don’t get too excited. The trains are dead now.\nBEAUTY: Shame.\nPRETTY: Well, there’s nothing here, Mum. Come on, we’d better get moving. Wouldn’t want Business catching us now [would we]-\nBEAUTY: (EXPRESSION OF HORROR) Happy journey! The Wailer!\nPRETTY: Don’t just stand there, Mum. Move!\nELDER BONES: (APPEARING FROM OFF) Not so fast, young Swanson.\nBEAUTY: (FAST, STARTLED, A CURSE) Turbulence! Oh, it’s you, Elder Bones.\nPRETTY: Mother! (FORMAL) We welcome Elder Bones.\nELDER BONES: Your welcome is received.\nBEAUTY: What are you doing here, sir?\nPRETTY: Where’s Naysmith?\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 62\nELDER BONES: Little Naysmith is safe. Oh, but I am pleased to have run into the pair of you.\nPRETTY: Pleased? Why?\nELDER BONES: There is a task you can perform for me. Yes, and the whole of\nELDER BONES: Economy, too.\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 63\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 37: INT. DUTY FREE\nDOCTOR: (CONCENTRATING) An email connection, you see, needs to be comparatively robust, to cope with attachments. An electronic game, however, only needs to send a few bytes —\nMEL: To squirt out a high score!\nDOCTOR: Exactly. If there’s communications traffic anywhere out on the surface of Tantane, someone will be playing a game and data might get through. (FX: GAME SOUNDS PICK UP A NOTCH) Ah, that’s Level 2!\nMEL: What are you playing?\nDOCTOR: The Tantane Cathedral Game, apparently.\nMEL: I’1l1 look for another Handheld. See if we can’t both have a go.\nNAYSMITH: Doctor, our History Notes say that Business and Economy shared a common Crew once. You and Mel — you sound like Crew. Is that what First Class means?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Treat your crew as first class and they’1ll always get you home. (FX: ‘GAME OVER’ SOUND) Oh, rats!\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 64\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 38: INT. STARTRAIN CONDUIT\nROGERS: (FOLLOWING GALPAN THROUGH CRAMPED SPACE) We’re lost, aren’t we, ma’am? I knew we shouldn’t have left the tunnel.\nGALPAN: (LEADING) It’s a short cut. As soon as we’re out of this conduit, there’ll be a way to the Business Lounge, you’1ll see.\nROGERS: Swear I heard something behind us.\nGALPAN: You’re always saying that. Air con units: mind your head!\nROGERS: Air con what- (FX: CLONK! AS HE HEADBUTTS AN AIRCON UNIT AND FALLS WITH A THUD)\nGALPAN: Rogers? Rogers? Oh, Recession! (SLAPPING HIS FACE) Wake up, you imbecile.\nELDER BONES: (COMING UP BEHIND THEM: DEFINITELY HIM, BUT WITH A SLIGHTLY\nMORE: TORY AIR) What are you doing in this conduit? There is no way through to the Business Lounge from here.\nGALPAN: (RAISES HER GUN AND CALLS OUT) Show yourself, stranger! Who are you? Associate or Rival?\nROGERS: (GROGGY) I said there was something behind...\nGALPAN: Answer or I’1l1 shoot! Associate or Rival?\nELDER BONES: (WALKING UP) Neither.\nGALPAN: (STARTLED) Oh! Sorry, sir. I didn’t [reco-]. (FORMALLY) We welcome the Director.

Report.\nGALPAN: (GETTING UP) Sir, the Wailer is loose but we have wounded it.\nROGERS: It’s back down the tunnel, in the corridor [leading to]-\nELDER BONES: I know where it is. And I will deal with it. What is your name?\nGALPAN: This is Rogers, sir, and I am Galpan. I was an Apprentice eleven years ago.\nELDER BONES: Galpan. Yes, I remember. Well, when your colleague recovers, go to the Business Lounge as speedily as possible. Once there, form an Exploratory Committee. All armed. Then bring them to Duty Free — do you know it?\nGALPAN: I’ve never been, but I know where it is, yes.\nELDER BONES: Good. And be quick about it. There are two strangers there, and a child of Economy.\nGALPAN: The strangers that brought the Summer, you mean?\nELDER BONES: I need the man only. The woman and the Economy girl you can kill.\nGALPAN: Understood, sir.\nELDER BONES: (WALKING OFF) Follow me, the Business Lounge is back this way.\nGALPAN: Sir! (HOISTING ROGERS) Come on, you — we’ve got an assignment.\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 66\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 39: INT. CORRIDOR 3\nPRETTY: Fantastic, isn’t it? Elder Bones picking me!\nBEAUTY: I’m happy for you. But let’s get this done, then celebrate. How much further to Platform Three?\nPRETTY: Hard to tell. No more than a mile, I think. A historic meeting between Economy and Business — and I get to be the broker!\nBEAUTY: I wonder if Business are all as sharp-suited as they say?\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 67\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 40: INT. DUTY FREE\nDOCTOR: You build up your Cathedral, you see, by collecting the spires that fall from the sky — only they keep on coming faster and faster — gaah! (FX: GAME OVER)\nNAYSMITH: You have lost. Again.\nDOCTOR: Alright, don’t rub it in. The thing is, now it expects me to connect to other players —\nNAYSMITH: But you can’t?\nDOCTOR: There’s no connection — or rather, no other players. Nobody I can get a message out to, nobody at all I can ask for help. Has everyone on Tantane given up computer games for Lent?\nMEL: (RETURNING) Well, there’s at least one other person to play with now. (BRANDISHING HANDHELD) Ta-da!\nDOCTOR: Ah! Mel. Another Handheld, good. Keep your screen brightness on full. The more light we can cast on our situation, the better. (TURNING TO LEAVE) Come on.\nMEL: We’re going? But what about the game?\nDOCTOR: That can wait. We need to get to the Control Tower.\nNAYSMITH: Without Elder Bones?\nMEL: I’m sure we’ll catch him up.\nELDER BONES: Finally.\nNAYSMITH: Elder Bones!\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 68\nELDER BONES: (“LANGUAGE!\") Naysmith!\nNAYSMITH: Forgive me. (BY ROTE) We welcome Elder Bones.\nELDER BONES: Your welcome is received.\nDOCTOR: I’m sure it is. So the Wailer didn’t get you, then?\nELDER BONES: I wouldn’t worry about the Wailer. Once it’s fed, it rests for hours.\nMEL: ‘Fed’-?\nELDER BONES: Come now, Doctor — the way to the Tower is clear. From there, you can restore power to the spaceport.\nDOCTOR: Well, I’1ll do my best.\nMEL: Hold on — where is this Wailer now, exactly?\nELDER BONES: (VAGUELY) In the corridors. Somewhere.\nNAYSMITH: On the business side, you mean?\nNAYSMITH: In Economy! Then we must warn our people!\nELDER BONES: Indeed so. In fact, that is the next part of your initiation, little Naysmith. You must return to warn our people.\nMEL: Hang about! You can’t send her back there alone!\nNAYSMITH: Fear not, Mel. I am ready. I have Something to Declare.\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 69\nMEL: And so do I — I’m coming with you!\nDOCTOR: Mel...\nMEL: We’ve both got handhelds, Doctor, we can stay in touch — after a fashion.\nDOCTOR: If you must. But please, don’t take any unnecessary risks.\nMEL: Caution is my middle name.\nNAYSMITH: Mel, we must hurry.\nDOCTOR: (TO MEL) ‘Caution’?!\nMEL: (TO DOCTOR) Actually, it’s not. It’s —\nELDER BONES: Don’t worry, Doctor. I’m sure they’1ll be perfectly safe.\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 70\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 41: INT. PROMENADE\nNAYSMITH: My eyes are getting back to normal. So good to be able to see again.\nMEL: Wait! Stop a moment.\nNAYSMITH: Do you need to catch your breath?\nMEL: I need to picture the map. This is the Promenade, isn’t it?\nNAYSMITH: I don’t know its name. We don’t usually use it.\nMEL: It is. Like at Heathrow. Shops, restaurants, duty free and not enough toilets. But it’s the way everybody goes to the aircraft — I mean, what, starships?\nNAYSMITH: There were ten starships docked when the spaceport shut down.\nMEL: And the Promenade is the connection from all the starships into the terminals.\nNAYSMITH: So-?\nMEL: So I know a fast way to get to Economy. This way. Look for\nMEL: Signs saying ‘StarTrain’.\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 71\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 42: INT. DUTY FREE\nDOCTOR: Spare batteries for handheld, check. Courage, charm and cunning, check. (BRIGHTLY) Right then, Elder Bones — we'd better be on our way to the Tower.\nDOCTOR: (HE HEADS FOR THE DOOR BUT ELDER BONES STEPS IN FRONT OF HIM.\nELDER: BONES NOW HAS HIS BUSINESS VOICE ON)\nELDER BONES: Are you sure you have everything, Doctor. Best to be thoroughly prepared before embarking on a journey into the unknown.\nDOCTOR: You’ve changed your mind. (RE HIS VOICE) And your tone. I thought we were in a hurry.\nELDER BONES: I’m an old man, Doctor. I need to rest a moment.\nDOCTOR: You should think about regular exercise, but don’t ever tell Mel I said that.\nELDER BONES: (CALLING) Come in, Galpan. Ah, you’ve brought company. Excellent.\nGALPAN: (TO ROGERS) Rogers, take your men and secure the area.\nROGERS: Ma’am.\nDOCTOR: I didn’t know we were expecting visitors.

Several of them. There must be a nest nearby.\nMEL: Spiders don’t bother me. It’s the cobwebs I can’t stand.\nBEAUTY: Oh, Pretty. We’ve been stood ages on this platform and there’s no sign of these Business people.\nPRETTY: They’1ll be here. Elder Bones said.\nBEAUTY: I’m beginning to wonder why he sent us instead of coming himself.\nPRETTY: Ssh, Mum! I can see someone!\nBEAUTY: Where?\nBEAUTY: Up ahead. Someone in grey. Business people wear grey, don’t they? (WALKING FORWARD, CALLING) HELLO!\nNAYSMITH: Mel! I heard someone calling. I’m sure I did!\nMEL: You can’t have. (DISAPPOINTMENT) The whole platform’s blocked, look!\nNAYSMITH: Your eyes have adjusted better than mine.\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 73\nMEL: I drink a lot of carrot juice. Some sort of grey wall, up ahead. A rockfall?\nBEAUTY: (DISTANT, CALLING) Hello! Can you hear us?\nNAYSMITH: That’s Pretty’s voice!\nMEL: Who’s Pretty?\nNAYSMITH: My plus-one!

It smashed her, turned her to dust.\nMEL: (RUNNING UP) What are you two doing, standing around like a pair of ninnies?

Director, we can make it to the rim for sure.\nELDER BONES: Good work, Galpan.\nDOCTOR: “Galpan”, is it? We didn’t have time to introduce ourselves properly before. Hello, I’m the Doctor.\nGALPAN: (TO ELDER BONES) Begging your pardon, Director Bones, sir, but shall I shut the Prisoner up?\nDOCTOR: Shut me up?!\nROGERS: Perhaps you’d prefer to talk to the butt of my gun?\nELDER BONES: Enough, you two. Galpan, take point with Rogers; (CALLING BACK) you interns, stay at the rear. I’1ll handle the Doctor.\nGALPAN: Sir. (HEADING FRONT) Follow me, Rogers.\nDOCTOR: Such charming friends you have. So, just another — what? — four miles to the Control Tower?\nELDER BONES: Approximately.\nDOCTOR: And what happens when we get there?\nELDER BONES: Why — you help me reach the top, Doctor. Break the glass ceiling, you might say.\nDOCTOR: (ODD CHOICE OF PHRASE) ‘Glass ceiling’?\nELDER BONES: Move!!!

Whew.\nPRETTY: We left Mum. We shouldn’t have left Mum!\nMEL: I’m so sorry, Pretty. We didn’t have a choice.\nPRETTY: (RELIVING THE MOMENT, TRAUMATISED) Its skin looked so smooth, smooth and grey. It just charged into her, wrapped its thin arms around her. It squeezed — and then, then —\nNAYSMITH: Pretty, this won’t help —\nPRETTY: . then, it was like she turned grey, too, like frosted glass. Then she shattered, shattered into dust, and it began to breathe her in. And all I could do was stand and watch.\nNAYSMITH: You couldn’t have done anything.\nPRETTY: I should’ve done something.\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 79\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 47: INT. CREW CORRIDORS\nDOCTOR: This so-called ‘storm’, Elder Bones.\nELDER BONES: What about it, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I’ve just worked out what it is. Plasma fire on the spaceport forcefield — am I right, or am I right?\nELDER BONES: You're a clever man, Doctor. Not since the first generation of passengers died out has anyone divined its true nature.\nDOCTOR: Does the barrage always increase as the spaceport power fluctuates?\nELDER BONES: That’s the theory. But it hasn’t fluctuated like this since the day the barriers went up. And now the Wailer is clear of the Tower — well, let’s just say I’m hoping to get some serious fluctuating done.\nDOCTOR: (FX: STOPPING, WITH ELDER BONES) Hoping to?\nELDER BONES: Don’t you see, Doctor? It’s my own people out there. They’re the ones firing on the spaceport.\nDOCTOR: Your people? I thought these were your people?\nELDER BONES: My real people, come to rescue me from this wretched place. The Palpane never give up on one of their own.\nROGERS: (FROM AHEAD, CALLING BACK) Director Bones, sir, it’s getting\nROGERS: harder to open the doors.\nELDER BONES: (CALLING) Then use brute force. Smash them.\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 80\nDOCTOR: (TO ELDER BONES) Is that the Palpane’s answer to everything? Smash it?\nELDER BONES: If necessary.\nDOCTOR: Not very effective, is it? Four hundred years of firing and not so much as a dent. You’ve got to hand it to the Tantane, they make a mean forcefield.\nELDER BONES: True. Which is why I’ve just recruited the only man on the planet who knows how to switch it off.\nDOCTOR: Me, you mean? Take a memo, Elder Bones: it won’t be all that easy. We could be dealing with an alternating or plain positronic forcefield. My suspicion is that it’s the former — that’s the more common for this time zone — which means that I’ll have to bleed off the neutron feed into dual flux capacitors, whilst at the same time attempting to stop the failsafe kicking in. That won’t be easy, especially at gunpoint. And that’s in the highly unlikely event that I agree to help you in your machinations.\nELDER BONES: Oh, I’m sure I can make you see my point of view.\nGALPAN: (FROM AHEAD, CALLING BACK) Better hurry up, sir — I’m holding the door but it wants to go back.\nELDER BONES: Do excuse me, Doctor.

Let me help you. (STRAINING) I’ve got it. You’d better\nDOCTOR: stay by the Director. We don’t know what’s up ahead. Rogers and I can hold the door.\nELDER BONES: The Doctor’s right, Galpan. Take two interns and scout ahead.\nGALPAN: Sir. You two, follow me.\nDOCTOR: (EFFORT) How are you doing, Rogers?\nROGERS: (EFFORT) Slipping, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: (EFFORT) Brace it with your hands. I’ve got the bottom with my feet.\nROGERS: (EFFORT) Right-o.\nELDER BONES: That’s it. They’re all through. You can let go now.\nDOCTOR: (EFFORT) We’ll release at the same time, Rogers, okay?\nROGERS: (EFFORT) No, Doctor. I'll hold it, you go first.\nROGERS: (THE DOCTOR STOPS HOLDING THE DOOR FRAME. ROGERS TAKES THE STRAIN)\nDOCTOR: Thank you. Just one more thing, Rogers —\nROGERS: (STRAINING) Hurry!\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 82\nDOCTOR: Are you ticklish at all?\nROGERS: What? (TICKLED UNDER ARMPITS — GIGGLES) No, no, don’t do [that] — (LAUGHS, LETS GO...\nROGERS: (FX: AND DOOR PRANGS SHUT, SEPARATING THE DOCTOR — AND US — FROM THE REST)\nDOCTOR: Works every time.\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 83\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 48: INT.

Rogers!\nGALPAN: You’re Business, you’re supposed to keep a cool head. We can open the door again from this side. (SHE PRESSES THE PANEL) Get ready to pull it open... Now!\nROGERS: He’s gone!\nELDER BONES: Get after him, then. I need him at the Control Tower.\nGALPAN: Can’t be far. Rogers, you others — guns to stun; ricochet blasts! Either he’ll fall, or give himself up.\nELDER BONES: Wait! We need to blue-sky this. The Doctor is a serious competitor but ultimately he has the same goal as I do. He can’t free his ship if he doesn’t get to the Control Tower. So what will his next move be...?\nGALPAN: To get back to his fellow passenger?\nELDER BONES: The woman Mel, yes. Rogers, take the interns and search the whole route from Duty Free to Economy. When you find the Doctor, secure him. Anyone else, make them redundant.\nROGERS: Sir.\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 84\nELDER BONES: Galpan, you’re with me.\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 85\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 49: INT. STARTRAIN TUNNEL\nMEL: Pretty, do Economy know the Wailer is loose?\nPRETTY: No. They just knew about summer.\nMEL: That’s a pity.\nNAYSMITH: I’1ll say.\nMEL: No, I mean — if they knew, if they’d been warned, we could stop trying to reach them. You see, I’ve been going over and over the map in my head and I can’t remember any route that doesn’t take us back past the Wailer.\nPRETTY: Good. That means I can kill it.\nNAYSMITH: The Doctor and Elder Bones can’t help us. They’1l1l be well on their way to the Control Tower now.\nPRETTY: Elder Bones doesn’t want to help us. He just wanted us to distract the Wailer so he could get away.\nMEL: What do you mean?\nPRETTY: Elder Bones sent us, Mum and me. Said it was a great honour. Said I would broker peace between Business and Economy. And what was waiting for us? The Wailer. Which kills Mum while Elder Bones gets to the Control Tower.\nNAYSMITH: You don’t know that. The Wailer could just’ve been in the way.\nMEL: Though we didn’t see any Business on our side, did we?\nNAYSMITH: I can’t believe Elder Bones would sacrifice Beauty.\nPRETTY: I bet Business’s Director wouldn’t sacrifice any of his people. It’d be wasteful.\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 86\nNAYSMITH: Business are our enemy, Pretty.\nMEL: You were talking earlier about teaming up with them.\nNAYSMITH: I was wrong. (DOUBTS CREEPING IN) Business will always be our enemy... always.\nPRETTY: So Elder Bones says. (DECISIVELY) You two do what you like. I’m going after Elder Bones. (WALKS)\nNAYSMITH: Pretty! Come back! Pretty!\nMEL: Leave him, Naysmith. He’s hurt, that’s all.\nNAYSMITH: You don’t think he’s right, do you? That Elder Bones really used him and Mrs Swanson, to distract the Wailer?\nMEL: I don’t know. But I don’t trust that Elder Bones. Five-hundred year old men aren’t always what they seem.\nNAYSMITH: I hope Pretty will be alright.\nMEL: I’m sure he will. All he’1ll find that way is the rim corridor, it’ll take him in a massive circle back to Duty Free.\nNAYSMITH: Can’t we follow him?\nMEL: Not if we want to be sure of warning Economy before the Wailer gets there. We’ve got to go back, past the Wailer.\nNAYSMITH: That’s suicide!\nMEL: Don’t worry, I’ve got a plan.\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 87\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 50: INT. CREW CORRIDORS\nROGERS: (RUNNING) Come on! Thinks he’s so smart, that Doctor. But there’s nowhere else for him to go but this way!\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO, EMERGING FROM HIDING) Apart from behind this drinks machine, of course. That’s the problem with thugs: no imagination. I wasn’t planning on running away, just doubling back around the crew corridors and following Elder Bones at a safer distance. (WALKING) Now, if my calculations are correct, this should be Corridor B, from whence I can— (STOPS, BAFFLED) Corridor G? Well, where did you spring from?\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 88\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 51: INT. STARTRAIN PLATFORM\nNAYSMITH: (SOTTO) This is madness!\nMEL: (SOTTO) Not if it works. Come on: I think it’s dozing.\nNAYSMITH: (SOTTO) Sleeping off its meal of Mrs Swanson.\nMEL: (SOTTO) Very probably. Now keep your head below the platform.\nNAYSMITH: (SOTTO) The rail’s slippery here. Oil or something. Watch you don’t slip.\nMEL: (STOPPING. SOTTO) That’s not oil. It’s blood.\nNAYSMITH: (STOPPING. SOTTO) Blood?\nMEL: (SOTTO) Look at the Wailer. There’s a shiny patch on its skin.\nNAYSMITH: (SOTTO) So?\nMEL: (SOTTO) Naysmith, I think it’s bleeding. I think someone shot it!\nNAYSMITH: (SOTTO) Good. I hope you don’t expect me to feel sorry for it?\nMEL: (SOTTO) No, but it might explain why it reacted like it did when it saw Pretty and Mrs Swanson. It must have thought they’d come to finish the job!\nNAYSMITH: (SOTTO) It doesn’t think. It just kills.\nMEL: (SOTTO) It’s a wild beast. It acts on instinct. When it’s afraid, it lashes out.\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 89\nNAYSMITH: (SOTTO) Mel! It’s waking up! Whatever that plan of yours was, you’d better use it!\nMEL: (SOTTO) Well it rather relies on my wild beast theory. (FX: BLEEPS ON HANDHELD) I saw a camera app on this Handheld.

Come on, it can only be another mile!\nGALPAN: If we could just rest a moment, sir?\nELDER BONES: If we must.\nGALPAN: I’ve brought my ration with me, Director Bones, sir. I’d be honoured if I could share it with you.\nELDER BONES: Your honour is received.\nGALPAN: What will you have? Chicken or fish?

You could’ve been [caught and] — [STOPS] Pretty, what are you wearing?\nPRETTY: Pinstripes. Do you like them?\nMEL: Very clever! You went through in disguise!\nPRETTY: Not quite, no.\nROGERS: (EMERGING FROM BEHIND) Alright, that’s enough. Hands up, both of you!\nNAYSMITH: (STARTLED) Sweet luggage! Business! Don’t just stand there, Pretty. Run!\nROGERS: (STEPPING FORWARD) You Economies are so stupid. Can’t see what’s staring you in the face. Pretty-boy’s with us now. He’s upgraded to Business.\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 96\nNAYSMITH: What? No! Pretty, you haven’t!\nMEL: Oh yes he has, Naysmith. He’s in with them, right up to his red braces!\nPRETTY: I’m sorry. But Business are going places, Naysmith. Economy — they’re going nowhere.\nROGERS: You — travelling companion of the Doctor. I want you to bring him to me.\nMEL: Or what? You’ll downgrade me to cargo?\nROGERS: I’m not playing games, girl.\nMEL: Neither am I. There’s no way I’m selling out the Doctor!\nROGERS: (ASIDE) Interns — make the Economy girl redundant.\nPRETTY: What? — No, that wasn’t the deal!\nROGERS: Either you’re Business or your Economy, Pretty-boy. If you don’t want to see us liquidate your girlfriend, you can always close your eyes.\nPRETTY: You betrayed me!\nROGERS: Sorry, son. Just business.\nROGERS: (FX: SUDDENLY, MEL’S HANDHELD BLEEPS — TEXT ALERT SORT OF THING)\nROGERS: What’s that?\nMEL: Nothing.\nROGERS: It came from that Handheld. Show me. Quickly!\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 97\nMEL: It’s just a game notification. That’s all.\nROGERS: (GRABBING IT) Let me read that. “New Galactic High Score. Four\nROGERS: Million Cathedrals, set by...” Well, well. Set by someone called ‘Hello-Mel-I’m-lost’.\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 98\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 57: INT. CREW CORRIDORS\nDOCTOR: (TO SELF) I may not have thought this through. How long is it going to take Mel to beat four million Cathedrals?\nGAME VOICE: New player named “We’re In Duty Free” has sent you congratulations!\nDOCTOR: Ah-ha!\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 99\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 58: INT. BASE OF CONTROL TOWER\nGALPAN: This is it, sir. The base of the Control Tower.\nELDER BONES: (READING) ‘Restricted Personnel Only’. Well — not any more! Come on, Galpan. Up the ladder we go!\nELDER BONES: (FX: CLANGING METAL LADDER RUNGS AS ELDER BONES BEGINS TO\nCLIMB: )\nGALPAN: (CALLING AFTER HIM) Please, be careful, sir! You don’t know what’s up there. You could be running into trouble, sir!\nGALPAN: We could be running into trouble, sir.\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 100\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 59: INT. CREW CORRIDORS\nROGERS: Well? Anything more from player name ‘Meet-Me-in-Crew-Corridor- G'?\nMEL: Nothing. Sorry.\nPRETTY: Well, where is he?\nNAYSMITH: Perhaps he’s got lost again-?\nMEL: Hold on. —\nROGERS: What’s he calling himself now?\nMEL: Nickname “Lose-the-two-goons-please”.\nNAYSMITH: The Doctor can see us-?\nROGERS: In that case, (ALOUD) he can see I’ve a liquidator pointed at his girlfriend’s head, can’t he? Still, let’s not be petty. (BEAT) You two interns — back to the Business Lounge. On the double!\nPRETTY: You’re doing what he says?\nROGERS: Son, if you understood Business, you’d know you don’t share the credit with anyone, ever. And I need all the credit I can get with the Director right now. So I’m more than happy to recapture the Doctor single-handed!\nMEL: It really is a harsh, cruel world you live in, isn’t it, Rogers?\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 101\nROGERS: (CALLS OUT) Doctor, if you don’t show yourself in ten seconds, Ginger here gets it.\nROGERS: Stop playing games, Doctor. I’m not interested in your pathetic little messages.\nMEL: You might be interested in this one. It’s from someone called ‘Mindy Ourhead’.\nROGERS: Mindy who-?\nDOCTOR: (ABOVE THEM) Mind your head!\nROGERS: What-?\nROGERS: (FX: DOCTOR DROPS THROUGH VENTILATION SHAFT ABOVE, KNOCKING\nROGERS: OFF-BALANCE; GUN SKITTERS )\nDOCTOR: (LANDING) Hello, Mel. Did you miss me?\nMEL: ‘Mindy Ourhead’?\nDOCTOR: My finger slipped on the space button. It’s hard to text and\nDOCTOR: cling on to an air conditioning vent on the ceiling at the same time.\nDOCTOR: How are you, Rogers?\nROGERS: (AS IN “A FAIR COP”) It’s a fair trade. You got me.\nPRETTY: Yes, and I’ve got your gun.\nDOCTOR: Well, put it down, there’s a good chap.\nPRETTY: My Mum’s dead.\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 102\nDOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear it. Did I know her?\nPRETTY: You brought the Summer, and now my Mum’s dead.\nNAYSMITH: It wasn’t the Doctor’s fault, Pretty!\nMEL: Pretty, put the gun down.\nDOCTOR: Stay back, Mel.\nPRETTY: Yes, stay back. Do as you’re told. We all do as we’re told. Well, the last thing anyone told me got my Mum killed. I’m not listening to Elder Bones, I’m not listening to anyone. Especially not a Doctor who brought us that wretched Summer.\nDOCTOR: All we did was arrive, Pretty. Then all this just happened around us.\nMEL: Mind you, that does happen a lot.\nROGERS: ‘Elder Bones’. D’you mean, ‘Director Bones’?\nPRETTY: Stay down, you.\nNAYSMITH: Elder Bones is the leader of Economy. He protects us from Business.\nROGERS: Director Bones is the leader of Business. He protects us from Economy!\nDOCTOR: And the penny finally drops. Elder, or ‘Director’ Bones leads both Economy and Business. And I do believe he has done so for some four hundred years.\nROGERS: That’s impossible!\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 103\nDOCTOR: No, it makes perfect sense. Divide and conquer. One man controlling all of the last remaining resources in a cut-off Spaceport, holding the balance of power, making sure no one tribe gets the upper hand... yes, it’s all worked very well for him.\nNAYSMITH: But without his protection, people die!\nDOCTOR: I expect they do. Especially the ones who ask awkward questions. Questions like ‘why can’t we all just get along?’\nROGERS: Well, well. The crafty airsteward.\nPRETTY: (DEFEATED) Then who exactly can we trust?\nNAYSMITH: Me.\nMEL: Us.\nDOCTOR: Everyone. Why not start by trusting everyone and wait for them to prove you wrong? That’s what I do and I’ve never been proved wrong. Well, seldom ever.\nPRETTY: Everyone?\nDOCTOR: Well, everyone in this corridor, at least. Me, Mel, Naysmith, even Rogers. He can trust you, can’t he, Rogers?\nROGERS: I suppose.\nPRETTY: All right, but I’m keeping the gun.\nNAYSMITH: So what now, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Childe Roland to the Control Tower came.\nMEL: Very poetic, but isn’t that the last place we should go?\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 104\nROGERS: She’s right, Doctor. Elder Bones was buy-out keen to get you to the Control Tower.\nDOCTOR: He wants to restore the power, get the spaceport functioning again. Which isn’t a bad idea when you think of it.\nNAYSMITH: Functioning again? What would that be like?\nDOCTOR: Summer.\nNAYSMITH: Oh, Pretty. Just think of that: eternal summer!\nMEL: So is that what we’re going to do? Help Bones turn the power back on?\nDOCTOR: Not until we sort that ‘storm’ out. Elder Bones says it’s his people, the Palpane, firing on the spaceport forcefield.\nMEL: The Palpane-?\nDOCTOR: No, I’m none the wiser myself.\nPRETTY: (BY ROTE) “The Palpane were wonderful heroes, who could never be defeated by the dishonourable Shargrain — no matter how hard the Shargrain tried.” It’s a story Elder Bones used to read us by the campfire.\nDOCTOR: Heroes? Interesting. I wonder if that’s really Palpane plasma fire...\nMEL: You mean it might be ‘the dishonourable Shargrain’?\nDOCTOR: Whoever it is, I want to talk to them before I lower the forcefield.\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 105\nPRETTY: So let’s go! To the Control Tower.\nDOCTOR: Not you, young man. Not if you’re planning on bringing that gun.\nPRETTY: I’m not letting go of it.\nNAYSMITH: Then you’re not coming.\nPRETTY: Naysmith-?\nNAYSMITH: Go back to Economy, Pretty. Tell them to bunker down. Summer might be coming back — and they’1ll need to be told, so they it doesn’t frighten them.\nPRETTY: You’re not in charge.\nMEL: She sounds like she should be.\nNAYSMITH: Please, Pretty. You’re frightened and upset and you might put us all in danger if you come with us. Please, go back to the others.\nPRETTY: (MISERABLE) Alright.\nDOCTOR: Take Mel’s Handheld. If we need you, we’ll send you a message.\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 106\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 60: INT. CONTROL TOWER — CONTROL ROOM\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: THE ROOM IS BUZZING WITH ELECTRONICS. GALPAN BLASTS THE\nDOOR: OPEN)\nGALPAN: (ENTERING) It’s clear, sir, you can come in now.\nELDER BONES: (ENTERING) The Control Tower — after all these years!\nGALPAN: That’s a map control panel over there! And it’s still got power. We can see where Rogers is!\nELDER BONES: Later, Galpan, later. Now — (SETTLING IN CHAIR) — “bleed off the neutron feed into the dual flux capacitors...”\nGALPAN: What are flux capacitors, Sir?\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 107\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 61: INT. CREW CORRIDORS\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: A FEW SPARKS. DOCTOR LEADING MEL, NAYSMITH AND ROGERS\nTHROUGH: NARROW TUNNELS )\nNAYSMITH: Where are we now?\nDOCTOR: Crew corridors. Passengers get all the automatic doors, plush carpets and bright corridors with restaurants and gift shops. Crew get, well, tunnels.\nROGERS: So these tunnels run everywhere?\nDOCTOR: Pretty much. They mirror the passenger corridors above.\nROGERS: But what’s the point of doubling everything up?\nMEL: It’s so that passengers and crew don’t mix — right, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Right, Mel. Elder Bones kept them a secret, so he could move between Economy and Business with ease.\nNAYSMITH: Look! On the floor! I’ve found something. (PICKING UP DISCARDED TOOTH) It’s a tooth.\nROGERS: Merger me, it’s a Wailer tooth!\nMEL: Funny, it’s sort of — I don’t know, hollow. Like a straw. Ughh! A vampire tooth!\nNAYSMITH: But if the Wailer was here, and Elder Bones was, too...\nROGERS: How come it never killed Director Bones?\nDOCTOR: Good questions all. And the answers lie this way!\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 108\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 62: INT. CONTROL TOWER — CONTROL ROOM\nELDER BONES: I had hoped we could just bring the forcefield down directly, but it’s not responding. Maybe we did need the Doctor after all. No matter, let’s power up the doors. Move a few walls. Drain the system.\nELDER BONES: (FX: ELDER BONES SWITCHES ON MORE AND MORE SYSTEMS — WHICH IN\nTURN: SWITCH MORE ON THEMSELVES. )\nGALPAN: Sir? This forcefield — what’s it protecting us from?\nELDER BONES: It’s none of your concern, Galpan.\nGALPAN: Fields equal shields, sir. And the Protector of the Share Price does not bring down shields.\nELDER BONES: They’re my people! I’m not one of you, Galpan.\nGALPAN: Not one of us? Not Business?\nELDER BONES: Not Business, not Economy. I was trapped here and for four hundred years my people have been trying to rescue me! Switch off the forcefield — deplete its power, even — and I am out of here at last.\nGALPAN: You must be important to them, sir. Most people would have given up after four hundred years.\nELDER BONES: I’m a hero. The man who could’ve ended the war with the dishonourable Shargrain. Now help me drain the power from the shields.\nGALPAN: I’m sorry, sir — but whoever’s firing on us, they’re still firing on us. And we will not lower shields while we’re under attack.\nELDER BONES: Point your gun elsewhere, woman! Business people. You’re as bad as Economy.\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 109\nDOCTOR WHO: Ah, what’s this? (READING) “Welcome to Tantane Spaceport Control Systems. Do you want to lower forcefield? Y/N.” Y, I think —\nGALPAN: (ALARM) Sir, step away from the controls.\nELDER BONES: “Are you sure? Y/N.” Oh, for Palpane’s sake —\nGALPAN: No!\nGALPAN: (FX: BANKS OF HUMMING FORCEFIELDS SLAM OFF: BOOM, BOOM, BOOM! SILENCE)\nGALPAN: Is that it?\nELDER BONES: (STUNNED) That’s it. After four hundred years, the forcefield — is down! (LAUGHS)\nGALPAN: So.. what now?\nELDER BONES: We prepare for arrivals. (INTO MIC) Incoming vessel, you are cleared for landing. Welcome to Tantane Spaceport!\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 110\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 63: INT. CREW CORRIDORS\nNAYSMITH: Doctor! The lights, they’re blinding!\nROGERS: Summer again! Director Bones has brought back summer!\nMEL: Why’s he done that, Doctor? All he wanted to do was lower the forcefield, wasn’t it?\nDOCTOR: I think he’s preparing to welcome guests.\nROGERS: Guests?\nDOCTOR: Whoever it is the spaceport’s spent four hundred years trying to keep out!\nDOCTOR: (FX: SHIP LANDING SOUND ECHOES THROUGH THE CORRIDOR. VERY LOUD;\nLIKE: BEING NEAR A RUNWAY)\nNAYSMITH: What’s that noise?\nMEL: It’s a ship landing!\nDOCTOR: Mel — use the Handheld. Warn Pretty and the rest of Economy, there’s an Arrival coming in!\nMEL: Hold on, what’s this symbol on the screen?\nDOCTOR: Aerial, even better. Restoring the power has rebooted the Spaceport wi-fi.\nMEL: The why what?\nDOCTOR: Give me that, please. We need to connect to player “We’re-in- Duty-Free” again.\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 111\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: LANDING NOISE HAS STOPPED. DIALLING BLEEPS ON HANDHELD\nTHROUGH: )\nROGERS: That noise, it’s stopped!\nNAYSMITH: The ship must have landed.\nDOCTOR: (TO SELF) Come on, come on. Pretty, press green, it’s — pretty obvious.\nPRETTY: (OVER HANDHELD) — do I make this noise stop?\nDOCTOR: (INTO HANDHELD) Pretty, Pretty, don’t be alarmed, it’s the Doctor. Yes, it’s my voice, speaking to you through the Handheld.\nPRETTY: (OVER HANDHELD) Carry me on, I don’t believe it!\nDOCTOR: (INTO HANDHELD) Pretty, where are you?\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 112\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 64: INT. ARRIVALS\nANNOUNCEMENT: Welcome to Tantane Spaceport. There is one arrival.\nPRETTY: (INTO HANDHELD) I’m in Arrivals, Doctor. There are lights flashing, over the Arrivals doors. Green lights. What does that mean?\nDOCTOR: (OVER HANDHELD) It means you have to get out of there, right now!\nPRETTY: (INTO HANDHELD) Doctor, the doors, they’re opening —\nDOCTOR: (OVER HANDHELD) Get out of there!\nPRETTY: Boarding hell! They’re hundreds of them!\nDOCTOR: (OVER HANDHELD) Hundreds of who? Who’s there?\nPRETTY: Wailers!

I wasn’t trying to kill them.\nDOCTOR: All the same, I think I’d be happier if Naysmith had the gun. (TAKES IT & GIVES IT TO NAYSMITH) Here you go, Naysmith.

But I’m severely pressed for time. Rogers, isn’t it?\nROGERS: That’s right.\nELDER BONES: The one I sent to capture the Doctor.

Where is he, by the way?\nMEL: Elder Bones shot him. I’m sorry.\nGALPAN: Well, we’ll all be dead soon. Director Bones has initiated a reactor meltdown. When it goes down, we go up — the whole Spaceport. I’ve tried to stop it, but nothing works. The Director’s the only one who knows how to work the computer.\nMEL: We’ll see about that.

Reactor failure in 12 minutes. All passengers and staff, commence Evacuation.\nDOCTOR: Reactor failure?! Why did that have to happen now?\nELDER BONES: (APPROACHING FROM OTHER SIDE) Because I wanted it so.\nDOCTOR: You!\nELDER BONES: Don’t move! I’m armed.\nDOCTOR: So that’s what it’s come down to has it? A thug with a gun. Where’s the man who led his people for nineteen generations?\nNAYSMITH: He lied to us. Economy and Business — both trusted him and he betrayed us both!\nELDER BONES: Economy, Business, and this creature — frightened children, all of you. Four hundred years I’ve spent keeping you all in line. Four hundred long, lonely years! — can you imagine?\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 132\nPRETTY: You've killed people, and you expect pity?\nDOCTOR: (DRILY) No, I think he expects you to thank him.\nELDER BONES: They should thank me! They should be grateful! If it weren’t for me — if I’d not been here to show them the way — they’d have descended into savagery, into cannibalism, centuries past!\nDOCTOR: Quite possibly. But then, if you hadn’t smuggled the Wailer into the spaceport, if you hadn’t plotted to use it as a weapon of terror against the Shargrain — they’d never have been in this pickle in the first place, would they?\nELDER BONES: You’ve been talking to them, haven’t you? The Wailers?\nNAYSMITH: I don’t understand.\nDOCTOR: He was trying to smuggle the Wailer into the spaceport, to set it loose just as a Shargrain diplomatic ship touched down. Only Tantane Customs spotted them, and the spaceport went into lockdown. The Wailer fleet began its bombardment to get their young one back — and, four hundred years later, here we all are.\nELDER BONES: What does it matter now? This creature’s all they want — which makes it my passport out of here.\nNAYSMITH: Take care, Elder Bones. We’ve seen what even a baby Wailer can do.\nELDER BONES: Oh, it won’t hurt me. It’s as pathetically dependent on me as you are. All those precocious initiates I’ve fed to it, over the years...\nPRETTY: Initiates-?\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 133\nELDER BONES: Only the brightest. Only the ones who asked difficult questions. Don’t worry, Pretty, you were never on the menu. But your girlfriend was.\nPRETTY: The Wailers! They’re coming!\nDOCTOR: Yes, they must have followed us. This is going to be awkward.\nLEAD WAILER: (APPROACHING) Doctor finds our young. Doctor may not die.\nDOCTOR: Thank you. And a modal verb, too. Impressive! Listen: I’m sorry to say, your child has been hurt.\nLEAD WAILER: Doctor hurts our young? Doctor dies!\nDOCTOR: No, no, you don’t understand —\nELDER BONES: (CHUCKLES) Oh dear, Doctor.\nPRETTY: Wait! It wasn’t the Doctor! It was that creature there: the ancient one! The one we call Elder Bones! He stole your child!\nLEAD WAILER: True, this is?\nELDER BONES: Incontrovertibly true.\nLEAD WAILER: Elder Bones stole our young? Elder Bones dies!\nDOCTOR: Pretty, Naysmith, get back.\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 134\nELDER BONES: That’s close enough!

Get back, or it’s the child next!\nDOCTOR: Elder Bones — I beg you, stop the shooting.\nELDER BONES: Give me one good reason why I should.\nDOCTOR: You’re in danger of breaching the hull of this spaceport. Look: the ceiling’s already beginning to show stress fractures!\nELDER BONES: What’s that got to do with anything?\nDOCTOR: The forcefield kept the atmosphere around the spaceport intact. Now it’s been lifted. Don’t you see? Above us there’s only sky.\nELDER BONES: The vermillion skies of beautiful Tantane! It will be good to see them again, after so many years!\nDOCTOR: They’re not there, Elder Bones. After a four-centuries-long plasma barrage there’s no atmosphere left. Only a world left barren by you.\nELDER BONES: Thank you, Doctor. Information is always useful. (ALOUD) You hear that, Wailers? One good blast to the roof and we’re all dead! So get back!\nDOCTOR: That wasn’t what I meant —\nANNOUNCEMENT: Welcome to Tantane Spaceport. Reactor failure in seven minutes.\nDOCTOR WHO: SPACEPORT FEAR by William Gallagher (FINAL) Page 137\nELDER BONES: Or we can just wait until the reactor blows? Really, I’m not fussed.\nNAYSMITH: (TO DOCTOR) What does it mean? ‘Reactor failure’?\nDOCTOR: ‘Boom’ !\nPRETTY: (SOTTO) Naysmith, we’ll all be liquidated if we don’t do something! Wait here!

I concluded the negotiation!\nDOCTOR: You’‘d have abandoned the spaceport, abandoned all those people, just to escape.\nELDER BONES: Well, of course I would. The spaceport’s got minutes left, are you mad?\nNAYSMITH: Sweet luggage, the reactor! In all the excitement, I’d forgotten about it!\nDOCTOR: I hadn’t. (LOUD) Pretty! Step on the gas, would you? We might still have time to shut that reactor down!\nDOCTOR: Not the brake! We need to go faster, not slower!\nPRETTY: (UP FRONT) Nothing I can do, Doctor. It’s losing power!\nNAYSMITH: The lights!

CONTROL TOWER — CONTROL ROOM\nMEL: . and it was only at that point that it occurred to me to pull the plug. Stupid of me not to have thought about it until then.\nDOCTOR: Stupid? No: brilliant! Your timing was impeccable, Mel. Any earlier and the Wailers wouldn’t have got their child back. Any later and we’d have been toast. Good work, Mel.\nMEL: Thank you, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: But now we need to get the power back on and raise a forcefield.\nELDER BONES: And in case the Wailers decide to give us a parting blast?\nDOCTOR: They just wanted their child. I don’t think they’1l be back. No, the forcefield should stabilize the atmosphere immediately outside the spaceport. Your sharp shooting on the train platform could breach the hull at any moment.\nDOCTOR: There. That should do it.\nMEL: Some of the systems need security authorisations which we don’t have.\nDOCTOR: The only one that matters right now is... over there. Naysmith: I\nDOCTOR: wonder if you’d do the honours.\nNAYSMITH: The honours?\nDOCTOR: That blue button, there. Press it could you?\nDOCTOR: (FX: SHE PUSHES THE BUTTON AND THE SPACEPORT WINDOWS OPEN.

All over the spaceport, everyone will know.\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nNAYSMITH: They’1ll be frightened.\nDOCTOR: Do you know anyone who can help them?\nPRETTY: Yes: you, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Can’t. Sorry. Places to go, people to see. I think Naysmith’s the person for the job.\nNAYSMITH: Me?\nELDER BONES: Her?\nPRETTY: Why not?

So you’re going to do exactly what I say from now on, Elder Bones, or I might accidentally let slip what I know about you.\nELDER BONES: This is blackmail!\nNAYSMITH: This is government.

But this is a new world and I have faith we will all work together under my guidance, as I have guided you for nineteen generations. [We have much to do. Much we must repair. But we have light, we have power, I have brought us back the Summer and vanquished the Wailer. Never again will Tantane Spaceport be dark. ]\nNAYSMITH: Got to give him credit, he’s a good talker.\nDOCTOR: You’11l probably have to prompt him for a while yet.\nNAYSMITH: I can do that.
