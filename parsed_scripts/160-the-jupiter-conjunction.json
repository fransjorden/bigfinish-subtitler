And it doesn’t seem to be working.\nNYSSA: I think it’s just me it doesn’t work on. Did you make it?\nVIOLET: Oh no. I got it off an ex-serviceman. Poor guy’s an invalid, army won’t pay his bills. He’s still got some of his tech.\nNYSSA: And you’re using it to steal things.\nVIOLET: Only this spacesuit. And only because they won’t sell me one.\nNYSSA: Why not?\nVIOLET: Well, because I’m a backer.\nNYSSA: Backer?\nVIOLET: Piggybacker. You’re not Company, are you?\nNYSSA: No, I’m new here.\nVIOLET: Well those of us who can’t afford the shuttle fare, we hitch. You must be posh if you’ve never heard of backing.\nNYSSA: I suppose I must be. So why won’t they let you buy a spacesuit?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 9\nVIOLET: Only company can buy spacesuits. They’ve got to let us hitch, by law, but apart from that they’ve got us over a barrel — and they don’t like us going out, in case we steal anything.\nNYSSA: And is that what you’re doing?\nVIOLET: No, I’d never steal anything. Well, except this spacesuit. (BEAT) Can I trust you?\nNYSSA: Yes.\nVIOLET: It’s my friend, Manny. He went out. Got a suit on the black market. Then the comms went down. He’s been gone for ages, I’m afraid something’s happened.\nNYSSA: And you can’t tell the staff here because he shouldn’t have been out in the first place.\nVIOLET: Even if they knew they wouldn’t do anything, they’re busy with these thefts and they don’t care anyway. Please, I’m really worried — he’s been gone for hours.\nNYSSA: (BEAT) You shouldn’t go out there on your own.\nVIOLET: I know, but I can’t ask anyone here to —\nNYSSA: You don’t have to.

Interesting.\nNEWSREADER: (D; OVERLAPPING) Speaking on behalf of the Global Commission this afternoon, Georges Yakubu dismissed the reports of military manoeuvres on Phobos and refrained from commenting further, stating that such speculation was unhelpful at this time. The Jupiter Axis has also refused to comment, although senior figures have privately stated that the present situation is unacceptable.

Eight slash Q Panenka, craggy little place, circumference of about thirteen point two kilometres, has an elliptical orbit which takes it between Earth and Jupiter.\nTURLOUGH: Useful for haulage.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 11\nDOCTOR: If you catch it at the right time.

Are you armed?\nDOCTOR: Rarely, if ever.\nFALCAO: Cocky, aren’t they, Chica?\nST JUDE: Zane, Kim — check them for weapons.\nTURLOUGH: Look, we’re not going to give you any trouble.\nDOCTOR: We’re just visiting.\nFALCAO: Right. Just visiting in your ship that lands inside things without asking permission first.\nST JUDE: Grab the blue box, fellas. Take it to the workshop.\nDOCTOR: All this just for walking around your plaza?\nFALCAO: No, all this for stealing eleven-point-three Q’s worth of stock from our hold over the past few months.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 12\nTURLOUGH: That wasn’t us.\nFALCAO: Don’t deny it.\nDOCTOR: Tell us what we’re meant to have stolen.\nFALCAO: Almost thirty per cent of the cargo.\nDOCTOR: What? But the capacity of this place must be — How could anyone hope to steal all that from under your noses?\nFALCAO: With a ship that materialises inside things, maybe.\nDOCTOR: (BEAT) Ah.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 13\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 7.

Just a couple of girls we picked up.\nDOCTOR: Turlough —\nTURLOUGH: I didn’t even catch their names, to be honest.\nDOCTOR: (CATCHING ON) That’s right. Hitch-hikers.\nFALCAO: (BEAT) Take a look around for them, Chica. Check the backers’ camp.\nST JUDE: (LOW) You know I don’t like going down there.\nFALCAO: (LOW) We’re not debating it. I’ve had enough of you talking back. We are tightening up.\nST JUDE: (LOW) All right, all right.

You wait out here.\nTEGAN: Nyssa, what’s going on?\nNYSSA: Her friend’s missing and she had to steal a spacesuit so she could go outside and look for him because people like her aren’t allowed spacesuits.\nTEGAN: Oh. Fair enough.\nVIOLET: Got it. Come on, there’s an exit that way.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 17\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 10. INT.

(BEAT) Please.\nDOCTOR: Lovely view.\nTURLOUGH: Are you being sarcastic?\nDOCTOR: Not at all. How big is this settlement?\nFALCAO: Three hundred and sixteen employees. And thanks to you, they might not be employed much longer.\nDOCTOR: And this place looks to be.. less than a kilometre across, I'd say. Presumably the hold is bigger.\nFALCAO: As if you haven’t seen the hold. I’m going to change this wretched music.\nDOCTOR: If I recall correctly the orbit of this comet is relatively fast, makes a full circuit in three years and three months.\nDOCTOR: AN IRREGULAR TIME SIGNATURE.\nFALCAO: That’s better.\nDOCTOR: If the year is 2329, and you’re nearly back at Earth... (MUTTERS ) Twenty, thirty, forty, fifty... and if Jupiter was... Yes, you have conjunction, almost ideal in fact. Journey time about eighteen months. Am I right?\nFALCAO: Yeah, well — I’m sure you done your research.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 24\nDOCTOR: I worked it out in my head just now, honestly.\nTURLOUGH: Don’t worry, Doctor — I’m impressed.\nDOCTOR: But you won’t get conjunction next time around. Jupiter will be about fifty degrees from where you need it to be. May as well use a freighter and go direct. Not looking too good the next time either. Could be a lean six years —\nFALCAO: Sit down.\nTURLOUGH: Here, or —\nFALCAO: (SHOUTS) Shut up!

Watch for any ships coming in or taking off. If someone comes to pick them up, we get them too.

You can float away completely if your boots lose traction. Make sure the grips lock on every time you take a step.\nTEGAN: (D) Thanks. Are the guards still following us?\nNYSSA: (D) They don’t seem to be.\nVIOLET: (D) Maybe they’re just going to wait for us to come back, when we run out of air.\nTEGAN: (D) We should get on with looking for your friend then, shouldn’t we? What’s his name?\nVIOLET: (D) Manny.\nNYSSA: (D) Do you have any idea where he went?\nVIOLET: (D) He’ll have gone this way initially, the cleanest water is over there. But that’s less than half an hour away and he’s been gone for nine hours, so —\nTEGAN: (D) He could be anywhere. Spread out and keep in radio contact, I guess.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 27\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 16. INT. BREAK ROOM\nFALCAO: Your friends just stole some spacesuits and fled the settlement. Not the sort of thing innocent people do.\nTURLOUGH: I told you, we don’t know them.\nFALCAO: Save it. What kind of operation are you guys running?\nDOCTOR: We’re not.\nFALCAO: You're not terrorists. There’s stuff you could’ve taken and used to make bombs, but you didn’t. So you’re stealing to sell Tt .on.\nDOCTOR: Look, if we really had it in us to carry out the kind of stealth raids you’re talking about, why would we suddenly blunder in and let ourselves get caught so easily?\nFALCAO: Maybe you’ve just got complacent.\nTURLOUGH: Do you have a single piece of evidence that we’ve actually been in your hold?\nFALCAO: I don’t think you ever got out in the hold. I think you rigged something up so the stuff disappeared when your ship did. What is that ship, military hardware? You steal that too?\nDOCTOR: That’s a baseless assertion.\nFALCAO: We’ll see. We can’t offer you a lawyer so you’1l have to represent yourselves.\nDOCTOR: Then I’1l need to see the evidence against us, whatever it is.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 28\nFALCAO: Of course, you have a right to a fair trial and you can request anything you need to present your case. Your trial will take place at nineteen-hundred hours.\nDOCTOR: Today?\nFALCAO: Today.\nTURLOUGH: (BEAT) This is starting to feel ominous.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 29\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 17.

Yes!\nVIOLET: (D) That’s him!\nNYSSA: (D) Where are you? Move if you can.\nMANNY: I’m not... I’m not sure IT...\nTEGAN: (D) Nyssa, I see him — he’s just near me. Hey there. Mate! Is your name Manny?\nMANNY: Wuh... who...?\nTEGAN: (D) Easy, Manny. Easy. We’re going to sort you out, OK?\nMANNY: Violet...?\nVIOLET: (D) You’re with him now?\nTEGAN: (D) Yeah.

BREAK ROOM\nDOCTOR: Did you get my request?\nST JUDE: Yeah, we’ve released the security footage to your desktop. I don’t know what you expect to find. There’s just interference, then the picture clears and the stuff’s gone.\nDOCTOR: These spells of interference, can I see an example?\nDOCTOR: TERMINAL.\nST JUDE: There.\nDOCTOR: Aha.\nTURLOUGH: It’s just a fuzzy screen.\nDOCTOR: There is some signal in there. It’s just a case of teasing it out by neutralising the interference, as far as one can.\nST JUDE: You think we didn’t try that?\nDOCTOR: No, but I think you failed.\nST JUDE: I bet it doesn’t work.\nDOCTOR: Yes, well our liberty is at stake, so I think we’ll have a bash. Just means running several sets of simultaneous equations, and then... right, here goes.\nTRIUMPHANT: ‘ENTER’ FLOURISH.\nDOCTOR: Let’s see...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 31\nST JUDE: Woah.\nDOCTOR: It’s not perfect, I know, but enough to let us see what’s going on.\nTURLOUGH: Er... Doctor? Have you seen what’s going on?\nDOCTOR: (BEAT) It can’t be.\nST JUDE: Oh dear.\nDOCTOR: But we’ve never been aboard this comet before. I’m telling you.\nST JUDE: And the stolen materials disappear when you do. Thanks, guys.\nTURLOUGH: What’s going on, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: The footage must have been tampered with. Someone realised we would want to decode it, so they fabricated this ‘interference’ on purpose.\nTURLOUGH: Even I think that sounds desperate. Are you sure you’ve never been here before? In your own future, even?\nDOCTOR: I can’t see why I would.\nTURLOUGH: I’m not saying you don’t have a good reason. Maybe one day you’1ll need all that stuff to save the galaxy, or something?\nDOCTOR: Even if that was the case, the way the TARDIS lifted those materials — it doesn’t do that. We’re being framed.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 32\nTURLOUGH: Why us?\nDOCTOR: Wrong place, wrong time. We’re ideal suspects, and a few inconsistencies in the evidence won’t change that.\nTURLOUGH: So who do you think’s responsible?\nDOCTOR: Someone on the inside. Someone who needs to get a result.\nTURLOUGH: Yes. (RAISING VOICE) Guards! I’d like to speak to Mr Falcao, please. Can you send him down?\nDOCTOR: What are you going to say to Falcao?\nTURLOUGH: Leave this to me.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 33\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 19. EXT.

BREAK ROOM\nDOCTOR: Why would anyone steal these particular items?\nTURLOUGH: To sell them on, presumably. Like Falcao said.\nDOCTOR: Yes, but some of them are so low-cost, others are high-value. You’d think they’d want to maximise their [ill-gotten gains] —\nFALCAO: You wanted to see me?\nTURLOUGH: Ah yes. I’d like to confess, please.\nDOCTOR: What?\nFALCAO: Excellent.\nTURLOUGH: On condition of immunity from prosecution. I’1l turn evidence against my accomplice if you let me go.\nDOCTOR: Turlough?\nFALCAO: I don’t know —\nWALTON: (D) Yes, we accept.\nFALCAO: How long have you been listening in, Patricia?\nWALTON: (D) Quite a while. The central plaza is all set up for court proceedings, we can go straight to trial. Prepare to take his statement.\nFALCAO: Right then. Come on.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 36\nTURLOUGH: Sorry, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Turlough, this isn’t the way.\nTURLOUGH: It’s been fun, but...

What’s happening to him? He said something about a lightning bolt?\nNYSSA: (D) I heard, but his injuries could be consistent with components in his suit shorting out. (TO VIOLET) You said he got it on the black market?\nVIOLET: (D) Yes, but could that really [cause —]\nNYSSA: (D) Yes, it could! Right now, it’s only the suit’s life support systems keeping him alive. But I think they’re failing.\nVIOLET: (D) Failing-?!\nNYSSA: (D) Violet, is there still no response from the settlement?\nVIOLET: (D) No, not yet.\nTEGAN: (D) Well, why not? What’s the matter with them?\nVIOLET: (D) Like I said, there’s been a lot of interference lately. We’ve even lost touch with Earth [a few —]\nTEGAN: (D) He’s stopped breathing.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 38\nVIOLET: (D) What?\nTEGAN: (D) Nyssa, you’re the one who hangs around in hospitals. What do we do?\nNYSSA: (D) His suit’s systems have shorted out. We need a defibrillator — one that will work though his spacesuit.\nTEGAN: (D) Well, we haven’t got one!\nNYSSA: (D) Thank you, Tegan, I realise that! (BEAT) Violet — your scrambler.\nVIOLET: (D) My scrambler-?\nNYSSA: (D) Yes, pass me your neural scrambler. Now!\nTEGAN: (D) I’m no expert, but isn’t that about as much use as a spacehopper to a wallaby?\nNYSSA: (D) The suit will deflect the charge if I try to restart his heart with it. But with the safety gate off, it might be enough to boost the power to his suit’s life support systems.\nTEGAN: (D) I get you-!\nNYSSA: (D) Clear-!\nTEGAN: (D) Try again.\nNYSSA: (D) Clear-!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 39\nTEGAN: (D) Nyssa...?\nNYSSA: (D; FRUSTRATED) I thought...

THEN A DOOR OPENS AND THE DOCTOR IS ESCORTED\nOUT: BY ST JUDE. THE CROWD REACTS NEGATIVELY TO HIS APPEARANCE, JEERING.\nDOCTOR: Is it necessary to hold my trial in the middle of the main plaza?\nST JUDE: We don’t have a courtroom.\nWALTON: (OFF) Bring the accused forward.\nST JUDE: Come on.\nST JUDE: GRUMBLES AND A FEW BOOS.\nDOCTOR: I wonder what the crowd have been told.\nST JUDE: Dunno, none of my business.\nDOCTOR: That I’ve put their livelihoods, their futures at risk? That I’m the reason everything’s going to fall apart? Nothing to do with your little curve of profitability coming [to an end —]\nST JUDE: Shut up, stand on the box and face the boss.\nDOCTOR: If I must.\nWALTON: Patricia Walton presiding. By the power vested in me by the constitution of Panenka, I bring Dr John Smith to stand trial.\nDOCTOR: By jury?\nWALTON: No, by me. You stand accused of trespassing on, and stealing cargo from, this facility. How do you respond?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 41\nDOCTOR: Not guilty.\nWALTON: A guilty plea will result in a reduced sentence.\nDOCTOR: In that case, it’s a shame I didn’t do it.\nWALTON: The case for the prosecution will be presented first, and then you will have an opportunity to defend yourself. We’1ll begin with the testimony of your accomplice. (CALLING) Mr Falcao, produce your witness.\nTURLOUGH: Evening.\nFALCAO: The witness will stand and face the accused. (BEAT) Your name, please.\nTURLOUGH: Vislor Turlough.\nFALCAO: Mr Turlough has admitted responsibility for a series of large- scale thefts from the hold.\nDOCTOR: Has he indeed.\nTURLOUGH: Yes. You see, we wanted money. Lots and lots and lots of money.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 42\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 24. EXT. COMET\nNYSSA: (D) Where did Violet say she was going?\nTEGAN: (D) Just away, to gather her thoughts. I think she probably just didn’t want to spend any more time sitting with her dead boyfriend.\nNYSSA: (D) What do you mean, boyfriend?\nTEGAN: (D) Nyssa, it’s obvious. Can she hear us?\nNYSSA: (D) No, helmet comms are set on one-to-one.\nTEGAN: (D) So what do you think happened to him? His suit fritzed out, like you said? An accident?\nNYSSA: (D) That’s what it looks like. Specifically, what we’re meant to think it looks like.\nTEGAN: (D) Meant to think-? Wait — Violet’s coming back.\nNYSSA: (D) Violet! Are you all right?\nVIOLET: (D) I’ve just been looking around out there. No footprints in any direction. Except the ones we just made.\nTEGAN: (D) You're saying they’ve been covered over?\nVIOLET: (D) I’m not sure how you’d cover over tracks out there. Boot- grips always leave marks in the ice.

(TO TURLOUGH) Where do you claim you hid it?\nTURLOUGH: On the comet.\nWALTON: (BEAT) I don’t believe you.\nFALCAO: Where on the comet?\nTURLOUGH: Several locations. Have you got a map?\nFALCAO: (TO A COMPUTER) Map.\nWALTON: But this doesn’t make sense.\nDOCTOR: Quite.\nDOCTOR: sort of\nDOCTOR: testimony\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 44\nFALCAO: I thought I was questioning him.\nWALTON: How did you plan to pick it up?\nTURLOUGH: When we got close to Earth, we’d have used the TARDIS to do a short hop and take it with us.\nTURLOUGH: BLEEPS.\nTURLOUGH: Now, the stolen materials are hidden here, here, here... here... both of those... was there one here?\nFALCAO: Why so many sites?\nTURLOUGH: If one was discovered, we’d have had time to clear the others. Yes, definitely here — and here, and here, and here. And here.\nWALTON: But there can’t be one there.\nFALCAO: Why not?\nWALTON: Because — Well it’s in the unstable zone.\nDOCTOR: Unstable zone?\nFALCAO: Yes, the crust there fractured six years ago. Nobody goes there, it’s incredibly dangerous.\nTURLOUGH: Well we must have just been lucky.\nWALTON: But this entirely lacks credibility.\nFALCAO: But we can’t ignore this, we have to go and look. Patricia, we could recover everything we’ve lost. No need to default.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 45\nFALCAO: I’1ll take a look at this one in the unstable zone.\nWALTON: What? You will?\nFALCAO: I can’t send a man in there if I’m not willing to go myself. Thank you, Mr Turlough.\nTURLOUGH: You’re welcome.\nFALCAO: (TO GUARD) O’Hara, take him back to the break room.\nDOCTOR: So, while we’re waiting, perhaps we could take a look at the other evidence? Oh wait, there isn’t any.\nWALTON: Perhaps the assembled employees would like to see the security footage which the defendant himself decoded?\nDOCTOR: Oh of course, there’s that. Could the assembled employees bear in mind that the defendant would have to be an idiot —\nWALTON: (TALKING OVER HIM) No they cannot.\nDOCTOR: — to decode that footage if he knew his ship was likely to be on it, and consider the likelihood that the footage was forged so that he would find the opposite of what he expected to find?\nWALTON: You are in contempt of court.\nDOCTOR: Of course I am. It’s not even a proper court, it’s a shopping precinct. This is nothing more than a piece of stage-managed theatre.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 46\nWALTON: The charge will be added to those already put to you. Carter, take him to the break room and confine him there until the patrols report back. We can’t have him trying to influence the public.\nDOCTOR: (CALLS AFTER HER) If I’m not allowed to influence anyone, there’s scarcely any point in my being counsel for my own defence, is there? (TO GUARD) Yes, all right, you don’t have to shove.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 47\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 26. INT. SHUTTLE HANGAR\nFALCAO: What are comms like?\nST JUDE: Long-range still whacked, been down for hours. Short-range is all right though.\nFALCAO: If we use all the shuttles we can get around all eleven sites within the hour. I’m assigning three-man parties to each shuttle.\nST JUDE: What if the sites are guarded?\nFALCAO: We’ll go in armed. (STOPS) You’re in charge ‘til I get back, St Jude.\nST JUDE: Whatever you think, Mr Falcao.\nFALCAO: (RAISING VOICE, ADDRESSING GUARDS) OK, then, people — whatever you find, don’t bring it back. We don’t have time. Leave one man standing sentry, we’ll arrange collection later.\nST JUDE: And don’t take any stupid risks. If you run into trouble, widecast it right away.\nFALCAO: Let’s get this wrapped up before bedtime, OK?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 27. INT. BREAK ROOM\nDOCTOR: Turlough.\nTURLOUGH: Hello, Doctor.\nGUARD: Will you be all right with him, Mr Turlough?\nTURLOUGH: Oh, I think so. He doesn’t often get violent.\nDOCTOR: Not often, no.\nGUARD: It’s your funeral.\nDOCTOR: I’m not angry, Turlough.\nTURLOUGH: Really?\nDOCTOR: Mostly, I’m just disappointed.\nTURLOUGH: You thought highly enough of me to be disappointed? That nice.\nDOCTOR: 48\nDOCTOR: ‘s\nDOCTOR: That’1ll be the shuttles taking off. To look for the things you\nDOCTOR: said we’d stolen.\nTURLOUGH: Yes.\nDOCTOR: I’m not sure I understand. What do you plan to do when they get\nDOCTOR: there and find nothing?\nTURLOUGH: I don’t think it matters, we’ll have escaped by then.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 49\nDOCTOR: (PENNY DROPS) Ah.\nTURLOUGH: Yes. They’re down to a skeleton staff now, I doubt there’s even anyone available to listen in to this conversation.\nDOCTOR: Still, I doubt they’1ll just let us walk out of here.\nTURLOUGH: No, but for all their bravado I don’t think they know what they’re doing. I think that’s what all the bravado’s about, actually.\nDOCTOR: I agree. They had a nice, quiet little town here, off the beaten track, not much of a target... and now, suddenly, they’re scared. I wish they’d let us help.\nTURLOUGH: You still want to help? After how we’ve been treated?\nDOCTOR: Of course. If we don’t, imagine what it’1ll do to this community.\nTURLOUGH: I'd be happy to see the back of this community, but fair enough.\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry I doubted you.\nTURLOUGH: That’s all right, I did my best to make you doubt me.\nDOCTOR: You could have let me in on it.\nTURLOUGH: Let’s just get out of here, shall we? You do the honours.\nDOCTOR: (LOUD) Aaaaaargh!\nTURLOUGH: (CALLS) Guard! Guard! There’s something wrong with the prisoner! Come quickly — I think he’s dying!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 50\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 28. EXT. COMET\nTEGAN: (D) I don’t think the shuttle’s coming.\nVIOLET: (D) Typical. They’d just leave someone to die out here —\nNYSSA: (D) Even if they’d come straight away, there’s nothing they could have done for him.\nTEGAN: (D) So should we try to carry him back?\nVIOLET: (D) But we still don’t know what really happened to —\nNYSSA: (D) Quiet. What’s that sound...?\nTEGAN: (D) Look! It’s the shuttle!\nVIOLET: (D; LOW) What...?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 51\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 29. INT. SHUTTLE\nDOCTOR WHO: HELM.\nFALCAO: We’re three kilometres away. Start taking us down, Pilot.\nPILOT: OK.\nPILOT: THE INTERIOR AND ALL AROUND THEM.\nPILOT: Argh!\nFALCAO: What is that?\nPILOT: Some kind of static. Burned my hands!\nFALCAO: Don’t touch the instruments. (TO COMM) Chica, we've been struck by an... electrical storm?\nST JUDE: (D) What? How?\nFALCAO: I don’t know how else to describe it, that’s —\nFALCAO: We’re going down!

INT. FALCAO’S OFFICE\nDOCTOR WHO: THEN STATIC.\nST JUDE: Anton?\nST JUDE: (BEAT) Oh no.\nWALTON: Any progress? I’m not sure that boy’s testimony is entirely — Why’s the comm making that noise? Can’t you turn it off?\nST JUDE: It’s Anton.\nWALTON: What’s he making that noise for?\nST JUDE: It’s crashed. His shuttle.\nWALTON: Oh my — How?\nST JUDE: He said there was an... electrical storm?\nWALTON: That’s impossible.\nST JUDE: I know it’s impossible, but it’s what he said and he’s not an idiot. (BEAT) What am I doing? I should get someone out there.\nWALTON: Wait, can we afford to do that?\nST JUDE: Afford? The shuttles are out there, if we just [divert —]\nWALTON: But they’re gathering essential evidence.\nST JUDE: But you just said — about Turlough —\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 54\nWALTON: Yes, but we still have to follow up the lead before the trial can continue.\nST JUDE: We've got guys out there dying.\nWALTON: Or dead. Have you checked their suit vitals?\nST JUDE: No.\nST JUDE: Um. I, I don’t think —\nWALTON: There’s nothing.\nST JUDE: No.\nWALTON: They’re gone.\nST JUDE: But the suits might have a malfunction — there might be interference, [or —]\nWALTON: We'll pick them up later. For now, those shuttles have a job to do. You’re in charge now, Chica. I’1ll upgrade your status and contract.\nST JUDE: Patricia —\nWALTON: It’s what Anton would have wanted. To get the job done. Isn’t it?\nWALTON: JUDE'S COMM.\nST JUDE: Um. Yes?\nGUARD: (D) The prisoners. They’ve escaped.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 55\nST JUDE: (SIGHS) Right. Mobilise, I’1ll be there in a minute.\nGUARD: (D) Mobilise who?\nST JUDE: (BEAT) Oh, grief.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 56\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 32. EXT. COMET\nTEGAN: (D) Nyssa, be careful! The whole shuttle might blow up any minute!\nNYSSA: (D) There could be someone alive in here. Violet, help me with this airlock.\nVIOLET: (D) Oh! Right.\nNYSSA: (D) There’s still pressure. Come on, Tegan.\nTEGAN: (D) Oh, great.\nTEGAN: SCENE 33. INT. SHUTTLE\nVIOLET: (D) We’re OK to remove helmets — the shuttle’s still got pressure.\nTEGAN: What a mess.\nNYSSA: Look! Over here, this one’s still alive.\nVIOLET: His suit’s functional — can either of you pick up his signal?\nNYSSA: I’1ll try.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 57\nTEGAN: (WINCING) Agh.\nNYSSA: Don’t worry. We’re here to help you.\nVIOLET: There’s another one over here... dead. Injuries like Manny’s.\nTEGAN: Ugh. And another here.\nFALCAO: They’re dead?\nNYSSA: I’m afraid so. Don’t try to move.\nFALCAO: What are you doing out here? Nobody’s authorised to — (BEAT) You're the girls who were with the guys that robbed us!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 58\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 34. INT. SETTLEMENT (CORRIDOR)\nDOCTOR WHO: SOUNDS.\nTURLOUGH: Are you sure the TARDIS is through here?\nDOCTOR: No, but this is my best guess.\nDOCTOR: Locked, of course.\nTURLOUGH: Can’t you sense the TARDIS’ presence or something?\nDOCTOR: Sadly, no.\nTURLOUGH: Hurry up, Doctor. We’re lucky they haven’t found us al-\nST JUDE: (OFF) Don’t move, right?\nTURLOUGH: We’re not.\nST JUDE: That was clever, getting us to clear all the security staff of here.\nTURLOUGH: Not clever enough.\nDOCTOR: Better luck next time.\nST JUDE: out\nST JUDE: There’s not going to be a next time. I’m in charge now and I’m\nST JUDE: going to keep a lid on you two.\nTURLOUGH: Have they fired Falcao or just demoted him?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 59\nST JUDE: Neither.\nTURLOUGH: He did seem rather incompetent, to be fair.\nST JUDE: He’s dead.\nTURLOUGH: (BEAT) Oh. Sorry.\nDOCTOR: How?\nTURLOUGH: We didn’t do it.\nST JUDE: He was going out to search one of the sites you gave us, the one in the unstable zone, and his shuttle went down.\nDOCTOR: Oh no.\nST JUDE: You led him into a trap.\nTURLOUGH: No, no I didn’t! I made it up, there’s nothing out there! Not that I know of, anyway.\nST JUDE: They’re saying it was an accident, but I don’t buy it.\nDOCTOR: You're probably right not to, but we didn’t do it.\nST JUDE: Then maybe it was your friends? The two women?\nDOCTOR: They’d never do something like this.\nTURLOUGH: You know who would though. Your boss. Ms Walton.\nST JUDE: (BEAT) What do you mean?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 60\nTURLOUGH: She was delighted when I decided to confess. I think she was expecting me to say your cargo was long gone. But then I told her it was all hidden around the comet, and she suddenly said I was lying.\nST JUDE: So? You just admitted you were lying.\nTURLOUGH: Ah, but how did she know that?\nDOCTOR: Because she knows where it really is, and she’s desperate for us to be blamed instead.\nST JUDE: What’s that got to do with the shuttle crash?\nTURLOUGH: I chose the locations at random. I wanted to clear the settlement of guards, so I went for a wide spread covering most of the comet. But there was one of those she really didn’t like. The one your late colleague just went out to.\nST JUDE: (BEAT) Could be a coincidence.\nDOCTOR: It could, but I can see you’re not entirely surprised by it.\nST JUDE: (BEAT) Walton won’t let me check the crash site.\nDOCTOR: You haven’t sent anyone? But there might be survivors.\nST JUDE: We scanned for suit vitals —\nTURLOUGH: Suits can break. If they’re alive out there —\nST JUDE: She won’t authorise it, says we’re too busy with the trial. I'd take a shuttle myself but they’re all out.\nDOCTOR: Help us reach the TARDIS and we’1ll go to the crash site.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 61\nST JUDE: The TARDIS — you mean your ship? It’s two floors down, in the landing bay. We’1l be seen.\nTURLOUGH: Not if you tell your few remaining security staff you’ve just seen us at the other end of the building.\nST JUDE: All units, right — I just saw the fugitives on the fourth floor going through the Accounts department, heading towards Navigation. Zone in and cut them off, they can’t get far.\nST JUDE: That all right?\nDOCTOR: Thank you.\nTURLOUGH: Let’s go.\nST JUDE: Wait — let me kill the cameras first.\nDOCTOR: You won’t regret this.\nST JUDE: I already am.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 62\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 35. INT. CRASHED SHUTTLE\nVIOLET: How is he?\nNYSSA: If I could get him back to the settlement,\nNYSSA: survive.\nFALCAO: I’1l send a distress signal.\nFALCAO: I think he could\nFALCAO: Don’t know why you’re helping me though. Your friends shot me\nFALCAO: down.\nNYSSA: The Doctor and Turlough wouldn’t do that.\nNYSSA: maybe, if he really had to.\nFALCAO: (BEAT) Well, Turlough\nFALCAO: Not them. They’re back at the settlement, on trial for stealing\nFALCAO: the cargo.\nFALCAO: NYSSA3: What?\nTEGAN: When?\nFALCAO: They’ve been doing it for months.\nTEGAN: We haven’t been here before today.\nFALCAO: Maybe you haven’t, but they have. And whoever else they’re\nFALCAO: working with shot this shuttle down.\nNYSSA: There isn’t anyone else.\nFALCAO: Someone shot down my shuttle.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 63\nVIOLET: Wasn’t us — we were hoping a shuttle would turn up, we had an injured man.\nFALCAO: I don’t know anything about that, but I was heading for where Turlough said he hid the stolen cargo.\nNYSSA: But we didn’t steal your cargo. He was lying.\nFALCAO: Why?\nTEGAN: He does that.\nNYSSA: He’s led you on a wild goose chase. But your crew’s injuries —\nVIOLET: You think it’s the same someone — or something — that killed Manny?\nTEGAN: Manny talked about a complex. You think that’s what we’re not supposed to find?\nFALCAO: What?\nVIOLET: Then we’ve got to find it. For Manny.\nNYSSA: We’ve got to get this man back to the settlement first.\nTEGAN: We don’t all have to go.\nNYSSA: What, you two go on ahead?\nVIOLET: Why not? Get on the trail while it’s still hot.\nTEGAN: If this guy was heading for it, we can get the coordinates off him. We’ll know exactly where we’re going.\nFALCAO: This isn’t your business. We should do this properly.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 64\nVIOLET: What, like you just did?\nFALCAO: Hey!\nTEGAN: She’s right. They knew you were coming. We need to surprise them.\nFALCAO: (SIGHS) I’1l give you the coordinates.\nTEGAN: The real ones please. Don’t patronise us by sending us safely out of the way.\nFALCAO: Of course not.\nFALCAO: I haven’t heard back from the settlement yet.\nNYSSA: Should you have done?\nFALCAO: Yeah, they should ping back to acknowledge a distress signal. I’1ll re-send.\nVIOLET: Let’s go, Tegan.\nNYSSA: I’1ll make sure they pick up Manny’s body, too. Good luck.\nTEGAN: You too. Both of you.\nNYSSA: So.

This one is excellent.\nTURLOUGH: If you like it so much, why don’t you buy it?\nDOCTOR: Perhaps I will. Who’s the artist?\nST JUDE: Falcao.\nDOCTOR: Ah.\nTURLOUGH: Do you do all these paintings yourselves?\nST JUDE: We’ve got a lot of time on our hands. Lot of boring stretches on these trips. Until now.\nDOCTOR: Do you paint, at all?\nST JUDE: No, I’m a musician.\nDOCTOR: Really! I used [to —]\nDOCTOR: CORRIDOR.

The co-ordinates told us this way.\nVIOLET: (D) I know. But if we go that way, we’ll have the ridge as cover.\nTEGAN: (D) Cover from what, that’s what I’d like to know. We’ve no idea what we’re up against.\nVIOLET: (D) If they can’t see us, they can’t — [hurt us.]\nVIOLET: (D) Wait — what’s that?\nTEGAN: (D) Yeah... I can feel it in my feet. The whole ground’s shaking!\nVIOLET: (D) Over there. A door!\nTEGAN: (D) What?\nVIOLET: (D) Door, hatch, something. Set into the ice. (ALARM) It’s opening.\nTEGAN: (D) If it’s opening, something’s going to come out of it.\nVIOLET: (D) And it’s a pretty big hatch —\nTEGAN: (D) So it could be a pretty big thing.\nVIOLET: (D) Come on. Behind the ridge.\nVIOLET: ABATES.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL)\nVIOLET: (D) Can you see?\nTEGAN: (D) No, but —\nVIOLET: (D) What was that?\nTEGAN: (D) I don’t know.

CRASHED SHUTTLE\nNYSSA: How are you feeling, Mr Falcao?\nFALCAO: Anton. Please. My left leg’s gone numb.\nNYSSA: Do you feel cold?\nFALCAO: No. Temperature regulator still works.\nNYSSA: That’s a good sign.\nFALCAO: Still no confirmation from base. Maybe they’re having comms interference [again —]\nNYSSA: What’s that?\nFALCAO: Sounds like we’ve a hull fracture.\nNYSSA: 3: Helmets on.\nNYSSA: APART.\nNYSSA: (D) Are you all right?\nFALCAO: (D) Yeah.

Does it play cassettes, too?\nVIOLET: It’s just an old two-D I’m afraid, but it’1l do.\nTEGAN: Do for what? What do we need a camera for?\nVIOLET: Because if we don’t get pictures, nobody will believe there’s been a complex on the other side of the comet all this time.\nTEGAN: OK.\nTEGAN: Well, what do you know. A baby camera. Hey, where’s the thing that tells you how many pictures you’ve got left on the film?\nVIOLET: (ALOUD) This is the unstable zone. Nobody comes here, it isn’t safe. So what’s this place for..?\nTEGAN: (OFF) Search me. Doesn’t look like there’s anything much here.\nVIOLET: Except for all this machinery.\nTEGAN: (APPROACHING) What machinery-?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 75\nVIOLET: Through the viewing gallery here.\nTEGAN: Oh my — Is that a -? (BEAT) Actually, what is it?\nVIOLET: What do you think it is? .. A weapon. A very, very big weapon.\nTEGAN: Like a missile?\nVIOLET: More like a cannon.\nTEGAN: This size? We should get some pictures.\nVIOLET: Yes. We should —\nTEGAN: That noise — that’s the noise we heard when the door —\nJOVIAN: You are unknown.\nTEGAN: Cloud-creatures.

None of the shuttles have found anything.\nST JUDE: You think they moved it already?\nWALTON: I’m sure they have. They held out the hope of recovery to give themselves time to escape.

This is messy...\nNYSSA: What are you?\nJOVIAN: We are Jovians.\nNYSSA: From Jupiter?\nVIOLET: They live inside dust and vapour, consciousness.\nVIOLET: its atmosphere.

(TO JOVIAN) Do you want to explain it?\nJOVIAN: No.\nNYSSA: I’ve read about life in Earth’s solar system. I didn’t know anything lived on Jupiter.\nJOVIAN: That is how we want it.\nVIOLET: A handful of people on the Jupiter colonies know about them. It’s embargoed.\nJOVIAN: Earth knows nothing.\nVIOLET: As far as we know.\nNYSSA: (BEAT) You knew nothing about them earlier.\nNYSSA: TIRED) ENTERS. DOOR CLOSES.\nNASH: Ah.

They should have put us in separate cells. And then we can go and find the Doctor, and find your other troops, and —\nNASH: I don’t have any other troops.\nNASH: NYSSA3: Did the Jovians kill them?\nNASH: I didn’t bring any others.

TARDIS\nDOCTOR WHO: CLOSE THE DOOR AND REMOVE THEIR HELMETS.\nTURLOUGH: (SCATHINGLY) ‘Cloud men’?\nTEGAN: I didn’t stop to ask for name, rank and serial number!\nDOCTOR: A Jovian. But I thought they all died out long before the colonies were established.\nTEGAN: Unlucky for us they didn’t.\nDOCTOR: That’s no way to talk about sentient creatures.\nTEGAN: Try saying that after those sentient creatures just chased you down endless corridors bunging lightning bolts at your head.\nDOCTOR: Sentient creatures do that sort of thing to me all the time and yes, I admit it’s challenging, but.. if you’d seen their civilisation in its glory days...\nTURLOUGH: A civilisation, inside Jupiter?\nDOCTOR: Almost entirely in their minds. Constructed from shared theory. A virtual world without computers.\nTEGAN: You mean telepathy?\nDOCTOR: Not quite. It’s more like a sort of whalesong, rippling through the atmosphere. Astonishing to hear, if you can tune yourself into it — and then you sort of see the structures of their society, like architecture made out of ideas.\nTURLOUGH: But you thought they died out.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 88\nDOCTOR: I’m not aware of them having any impact on the solar system after human civilisation emerged. But then, they did always keep themselves to themselves...\nTEGAN: They’re getting themselves noticed now. They killed that guy who went missing, and the crew of that shuttle.\nDOCTOR: The Jovians? I suppose they are capable of inflicting those injuries.\nTEGAN: One of them sucked my friend in, it was like it was suffocating her —\nDOCTOR: That’s how they carry things from place to place, they totally envelop them. It was probably just apprehending her. The question is, what are they doing here?\nTEGAN: Building something. You want to take a look? I’ve got pictures.\nDOCTOR: (BEAT) Ah.\nTURLOUGH: It’s a bit blurry.\nTEGAN: Yeah, well — my hands were shaking. (BEAT) What is it, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: It’s a long-range particle cannon. There’s a fusion reactor under here, the current is directed here and accelerated.\nTEGAN: Like a laser?\nTURLOUGH: Similar, but rather more powerful.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Precision sacrificed for power — because when you’re aiming at a whole planet, who needs precision?\nTEGAN: So why are they building this? The Jovians, I mean?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 89\nDOCTOR: I’ve never heard of a Jovian building a weapon. Not a physical weapon. I’m sure there’s something else going on here.\nTURLOUGH: Then I suggest we find out what Walton knows about it.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 90\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 49. INT. WEAPON SITE (OFFICE)\nNASH: Did the Jovians tell you they were in charge?\nNYSSA: No.\nVIOLET: Finding them difficult to control, are you?\nNASH: No. Our alliance is strong. They just... They’re a proud people, you know. They don’t like admitting we’re in the driving seat.\nNYSSA: Why are you working with them? They’ve killed people, you know.\nNASH: Yes, all very regrettable, but casualties of war and all that.\nNASH: NYSSA3: What war?\nVIOLET: With Earth.\nNYSSA: Why?\nNASH: You must be from Earth. Only Earthers would be so complacent.\nVIOLET: She’s from Earth.\nVIOLET: NYSSA3: I’m not.\nVIOLET: Aren’t you?\nNYSSA: No. What have you got against Earth?\nNASH: There’s no freedom on Earth. So collectivised and regimented — you can barely breathe without being told you haven’t done it in the regulation way. It’s stifling.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 91\nNYSSA: Is that all?\nNASH: Ever since we had independence they’ve been scared, because we let our citizens live their own lives, free from interference. And now they want us back, well, it’s not going to happen. What we're building here, this beauty is what’ll guarantee freedom for them and for us. Earth will never see it coming. And we’re almost ready to reveal it... but not quite yet.\nNASH: NYSSA3: And the Jovians?\nNASH: They also have an interest. Not that I need them, necessarily — their stealth is useful, but I have completed six extended- distance missions with only mechanised support. I mention this so that you know with whom you are dealing. I may be one man but I have achieved more than entire regiments.\nVIOLET: Well done.\nNASH: Why did you come here?\nNYSSA: To find out who killed her friend.\nNASH: Some people find it so hard to accept that they don’t need to know everything. I’m afraid the nature of this project demands that I kill you too.\nVIOLET: Another ‘accident’ ?\nNASH: We cannot afford to arouse suspicion.\nVIOLET: That will bring the total of people who’ve died in three separate incidents in this area over the last 24 hours to six. And you expect this not to arouse suspicion.\nNASH: You do realise you are speaking to a ranking officer [of the —]\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 92\nVIOLET: Yes, I do, because I’m one too.\nVIOLET: My credentials, if you’d like to run them through.\nNASH: The audacity of this [overwhelms —]\nVIOLET: You may regret speaking to a Lieutenant Colonel like this, Major. Before you go on, perhaps you’d like to check whether you are speaking to one.\nNYSSA: Lieutenant Colonel?\nNYSSA: DISPLAY.\nNASH: (BEAT) Good grief.\nNASH: (TUTS) I wish they’d use the comms system instead of zipping through the air-vents...\nJOVIAN: Nash.\nNASH: What is it? I’m busy.\nJOVIAN: The other intruder has not been captured.\nNYSSA: You mean Tegan?\nNASH: What? How did you manage to lose her?\nJOVIAN: She must have known the layout. She used an emergency outlet.\nNASH: Rubbish. You [just —]\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 93\nVIOLET: Actually — she didn’t know the layout, but I may have given her a little help.\nNASH: (BEAT) What?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 94\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 50. INT. SETTLEMENT (CORRIDOR)\nDOCTOR WHO: OUT.\nTURLOUGH: What now?\nDOCTOR: I think we just wait.\nTEGAN: For what?\nGUARD: Don’t move.\nTURLOUGH: That.\nDOCTOR: (TO GUARDS) Hello. Can you take us to Ms St Jude please?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 95\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 51. INT. WEAPON SITE (OFFICE)\nNASH: You wanted her to escape?\nVIOLET: I brought Tegan here for a reason and I let her escape for a reason. It’s all part of the plan.\nNYSSA: Whose plan? Yours?\nVIOLET: It was a collaborative effort, but mostly my own idea, yes.\nNASH: It was your idea to blow our cover?\nVIOLET: Ma’am.\nNASH: Sorry?\nVIOLET: ‘It was your idea to blow our cover, ma’am.’\nNASH: (BEAT) Ma’am.\nVIOLET: That’s better. This will not blow our cover.\nNASH: But they’1l report this to Earth.\nVIOLET: They won’t, because there’s a communications blackout. They can’t contact Earth. This is about removing the settlement.\nNYSSA: Why?\nVIOLET: War is imminent and the settlement is a security risk.\nNASH: You mean this installation will soon be called into action?\nVIOLET: Provided it’s ready.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 96\nNASH: Almost — we’re running final checks now.\nVIOLET: You’ve been exemplary, Major. A commendation awaits.\nNYSSA: I still don’t understand. Why let Tegan go?\nVIOLET: You'll see. But she’s essential to our reveal strategy. That’s why I planned her escape route and shielded her from the Jovians. If she’d been killed... back to square one. Like when Manny died.\nNYSSA: He wasn’t really your boyfriend, was he? What was he then — your partner?\nVIOLET: Manny didn’t know anything about this. That was the whole point, that he was a complete innocent. I made some tweaks to his nav and sent him out here.\nNYSSA: Sent him to die.\nVIOLET: No. The plan was he’d see the complex and then come running back. That’s what the profile said he’d do, but he blundered inside and.. so I changed my plans. And you’re not going to like my plans, so — Major, handcuff her to the desk please.\nNASH: Good thinking.\nNYSSA: Ow!\nVIOLET: Major Nash, can you assess the readiness of the weapon?\nNASH: Of course, Ma’am. There are still several outstanding drill reports —\nVIOLET: Give me access and I’1l sign them off.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 97\nNASH: I’ve filed them all with my CO. Some of them are months old — I did wonder what had happened.\nVIOLET: Oh, they’ve just been busy. Thank you, Major.\nNASH: I’1ll be in the control room.\nVIOLET: Excellent.\nNYSSA: You’re going to destroy those people’s lives.\nVIOLET: Nobody will sympathise with the plight of a budget logistics\nVIOLET: company, if they even notice. This installation was set up to keep our people safe, and our people will understand that. As long as we present it to them in the right context.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 98\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 52. INT. FALCAO’S OFFICE\nDOCTOR: Ms St Jude, hello.\nST JUDE: Back so soon, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: We’re very efficient.\nTEGAN: (ASIDE) You know her?\nTURLOUGH: Ohh yes.\nDOCTOR: We were hoping for a private word, if that’s possible-?\nST JUDE: (TO GUARDS) Everyone out of here and let me talk to the prisoners.\nST JUDE: What have you got for me, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid Mr Falcao is dead. So are his crew. I’m sorry.\nST JUDE: Right.\nTURLOUGH: But we know what he wasn’t supposed to find.\nST JUDE: Oh?\nTEGAN: Here. Look at this.\nST JUDE: Where’d you take these pictures?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 99\nTEGAN: On the opposite side of the comet. I don’t know if you can get a sense of how big it is? It’s massive.\nST JUDE: Is it tagged?\nTEGAN: Is it what?\nDOCTOR: She means is it stamped with the time and location.\nST JUDE: It is. Good. Do we have any proof she’s involved?\nDOCTOR: Walton? No, no proof.\nST JUDE: She could still deny everything.\nTURLOUGH: But this is enough to warrant a full investigation, surely. You could demand one. If she’s got nothing to hide then she’s got nothing to fear.\nST JUDE: She might just go ‘Oh, how ridiculous’. I mean, from a certain point of view, it is. And I’ve only got you to back it up.\nTEGAN: Charming.\nST JUDE: I just mean, you’re outsiders.\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid that the important thing may not be who did or didn’t let this happen. That weapon exists, and your people deserve to know about it.\nST JUDE: (BEAT) Alright. One minute.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 100\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 53. INT. WALTON’S OFFICE\nWALTON: Chica, what is it? I am very busy.\nST JUDE: (D) I’ve just found something out. I’m going to give you one last chance to tell me what it is.\nWALTON: I don’t know what you’re talking [about].\nST JUDE: (D) — “what you’re talking about”. Look, you can either own up and tell us the whole story and why you did it, or we can tell everyone what we do know and start a panic.\nWALTON: Oh dear. I think somebody’s promotion came rather too soon.\nST JUDE: (D) Is that a threat?\nWALTON: No, it’s a verbal warning.\nST JUDE: (D) So is this. Last chance. Want to talk?\nWALTON: There’s nothing to talk about.\nST JUDE: (D) Right.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 101\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 54. INT. FALCAO’S OFFICE\nTEGAN: Well?\nST JUDE: Well, she’s left me no choice, hasn’t she?\nST JUDE: SCENE 55. EXT. COMMERCIAL ZONE\nST JUDE: SYSTEM.\nST JUDE: (D) Listen up, this is a security announcement. It’s come to my attention that somebody’s secretly built a huge long-range weapon on the other side of the comet, using the stuff that’s been stolen from the cargo over the past few months.\nST JUDE: (D) You’ll find the evidence on the shared drive in a public folder, do take a look. I’ve got reason to suspect Patricia Walton knew about it and didn’t tell us. She says she knew nothing. As per the company’s constitution, I’d like you to vote on whether to suspend her so I can investigate. Voting closes in ninety minutes.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL)\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 56. INT. FALCAO’S OFFICE\nTEGAN: Wow.\nDOCTOR: Well done.\nST JUDE: It’s out there now, so if she moves against me like Anton, she only digs herself in deeper. I’1ll go and her, see if we can get a confession.\nDOCTOR: You should also contact Earth.\nST JUDE: I will as soon as this comms blackout lifts.\nDOCTOR: Blackout?\nST JUDE: We’ve been getting them for weeks. This one started turned up.\nTURLOUGH: We had nothing to do with —\nST JUDE: It wasn’t an accusation.\nDOCTOR: I’ll see if I can get around it. Mind if I use your\nST JUDE: Be my guest.\nTEGAN: What about Nyssa?\nST JUDE: Who is Nyssa?\nTEGAN: Page 102\nTEGAN: she did talk to\nTEGAN: just as\nTEGAN: console?\nTEGAN: She stayed with your mate Falcao and called here for help.\nTURLOUGH: And then we found him dead. She was nowhere to be seen. She\nTURLOUGH: didn’t come back here?\nTURLOUGH: you\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 103\nST JUDE: No.\nTEGAN: Doctor, we’ve got to find her.\nDOCTOR: I think we should try to contact Earth first, there could be an imminent threat.\nST JUDE: I’1ll go and talk to Walton.\nTURLOUGH: I’1l come too. See if she knows where Nyssa is.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 104\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 57. INT. WALTON’S OFFICE\nSUPPLIED: SEPARATELY).\nWALTON: (CALLS) I’m sorry, but I can’t see you without an appointment.\nWALTON: (LOW) Come on, come on...\nNASH: (D) Nash here, I’m afraid I’m in the [middle of —]\nWALTON: I’m activating the Helicopter Clause in our deal.\nNASH: (D) What? Slow down, woman.\nWALTON: Everyone here knows about the weapon —\nNASH: (D) Yes, we know. We’ve modified our strategy.\nWALTON: And they know I was in on it.\nNASH: (D) How?\nWALTON: I don’t know but there’s a very, very angry mob outside my office and I’m barricaded in and I want my Helicopter Clause! We agreed this —\nNASH: (D) Yes, fine — I'll send one of my men to get you. Stay calm.\nWALTON: You stay calm.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 105\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 58. INT. WEAPON SITE (CONTROL ROOM)\nNASH: This is all we need.\nJOVIAN: Shall I fetch Walton?\nNASH: Yes, please. Discreet as you can. Don’t get distracted.\nJOVIAN: Understood.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 106\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 59. INT. FALCAO’S OFFICE\nDOCTOR: Any good?\nTEGAN: Still no signal.\nDOCTOR: Hmm. Well, this is no accident. We’re being blocked deliberately.\nTEGAN: By the Jovians?\nDOCTOR: I don’t think so. The source of the disruption — it’s well disguised, but it’s coming from the settlement.\nTEGAN: Can you pin it down?\nDOCTOR: I’m trying. I think I can —\nWALTON: (D) Attention everybody. I just want to say, I’m sure you’ll all have a lot of opinions about me when you find out what’s been happening, but what you should know is that I did it for you. Because whilst you were slacking off, doing all your pointless mediocre paintings and plays and songs and novels and your witless, navel-gazing poetry, I was working on the stuff that actually brings in money, which is all about to fall apart in case you hadn’t noticed. I made a deal with some people who were going to shift the course of this comet so we’ll have conjunction for the next fifteen years. Thanks to you, that’s not going to happen. Well, I hope you’re happy.\nTEGAN: (BEAT) That sounded like goodbye.\nDOCTOR: Yes. I think I’ve got a fix on the source — let’s go.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 107\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 60. INT. WEAPON SITE (OFFICE)\nNYSSA: I thought you were going to read those reports.\nVIOLET: I need to check the situation back home. So who are you really?\nNYSSA: I told you. We’re travellers. I’m a research biologist actually.\nVIOLET: I thought you were Earth agents.\nNYSSA: Why did you think that?\nVIOLET: Suddenly turning up on the settlement like that. I couldn’t think of any reason why anyone would do that, so I assumed you were here to investigate the weapon. How did you get here?\nNYSSA: In the Doctor’s ship.\nVIOLET: Describe it please.\nNYSSA: Why?\nVIOLET: Describe it or I’1ll1 kill you.\nNYSSA: (BEAT) A blue box. Rectangular, stands on its end. It doesn’t look large enough for more than two or three people. ‘POLICE BOX’ written in English on the top.\nVIOLET: Thank you.\nNASH: Ma’am? Walton just called. She’s been found out.\nVIOLET: Oh? I wonder how?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 108\nDOCTOR WHO: NYSSA3: The Doctor’s over there.\nNASH: There’s an uprising going on. Walton’s trapped inside her office.\nVIOLET: Excellent.\nNASH: Not for her it isn’t. I’ve sent a Jovian to get her.\nVIOLET: But this is precisely the situation we want, Major. Are they threatening this facility?\nNASH: I don’t know.\nVIOLET: But it’s plausible. Angry scenes, and we know they’re carrying volatile materials in the hold.\nVIOLET: Hack the intranet... post some messages about loading those materials into the shuttles and using them to blow this place sky high... voila. We’ve been provoked. So what choice do we have but to retaliate?\nNYSSA: You're a disgrace.\nVIOLET: Send in the Jovians, Major.\nNASH: The Jovians?\nVIOLET: We need to nip this in the bud. The situation is turning ugly.\nNASH: But the Jovians won’t want to be seen. They’1l leave no survivors.\nVIOLET: Do we want survivors?\nNASH: But they’re.. not Earthers.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 109\nVIOLET: This comet is an Earth protectorate. People who are opposed to our way of life. Deal with them — that’s an order, Major.\nNASH: Yes, ma’am.\nNYSSA: What difference does it make whether this attack was provoked or not?\nVIOLET: It matters to our people. We’re the good guys.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 110\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 61. INT. WEAPON SITE (CONTROL ROOM)\nNASH: Jovians! I need to talk to you.\nNASH: APPEAR.\nNASH: Good. Now —\nJOVIAN: We know what your... Lieutenant Colonel wants us to do.\nNASH: I assume you have no problem with it?\nJOVIAN: We will go.\nNASH: Good. Just... conduct yourselves honourably.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 111\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 62. INT. SETTLEMENT (CORRIDOR)\nJUDE: ARRIVE.\nST JUDE: (CALLS) Stand aside please, guys.\nST JUDE: APPLAUD.\nTURLOUGH: I assume that’s for you, not me.\nST JUDE: (TO CROWD) Everyone please disperse, I need to talk to the boss lady.\nST JUDE: Come on, back off.\nST JUDE: And close the fire doors behind you.\nST JUDE: Now.\nST JUDE: Patricia? (PAUSE) Patricia, come out.\nTURLOUGH: Let me talk to her. (TO COMM) Hello? Ms Walton? It’s Turlough. (BEAT) You know, the one who cut a deal and then ran away? I want to talk to you about a friend of mine. Nyssa. Do you know where she is? (BEAT; TO ST JUDE) Is she even in there?\nST JUDE: There’s no way out. But she’s disabled the cameras...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 112\nST JUDE: And she’s busted the mechanism of the door. My override code’s not working.\nTURLOUGH: Maybe she’s dead. Can we cut through?\nST JUDE: No need, I can fix it.\nTURLOUGH: How quickly, though?\nST JUDE: Just watch.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 113\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 63. EXT. COMMERCIAL ZONE\nDOCTOR WHO: ECHO. DOCTOR HOLDS A TRACKING SYSTEM, WHICH BLEEPS QUIETLY.\nDOCTOR: Yes... this way.\nTEGAN: But that’s the way to the backers’ camp.\nDOCTOR: The what camp?\nTEGAN: Hitch-hikers. They live here.\nDOCTOR: Ah, riding the rails.\nTEGAN: I don’t think it’s quite that romantic.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 114\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 64. EXT. BACKERS’ CAMP\nTEGAN: WALK DOWN THE STEPS.\nDOCTOR: Good grief. I had no idea this was here.\nTEGAN: So it’s one of this lot that’s doing the blocking?\nDOCTOR: Let’s not jump to conclusions, Tegan.\nDOCTOR: THE TARGET.\nDOCTOR: Here we are.\nTEGAN: But this is Violet’s tent.\nDOCTOR: Who’s Violet?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 115\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 65. INT. SETTLEMENT (CORRIDOR)\nTURLOUGH: How much longer?\nST JUDE: Almost there... Stand back.\nTURLOUGH: Why?\nST JUDE: Well, she might have booby-trapped the door.\nTURLOUGH: (SLIGHTLY OFF) How far should I stand back, exactly?\nST JUDE: Here goes —\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 116\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 66. EXT. BACKERS’ CAMP\nDOCTOR: So where’s this Violet now?\nTEGAN: Still on the far side of the comet, I guess.\nDOCTOR: There’s more to her than meets the eye. But let’s deal with this device of hers first.\nTEGAN: Would she really just leave it in an open tent?\nDOCTOR: Why not? She shielded it very well, only someone with my experience could have found it. Keeping it under lock and key would only attract suspicion. Aha!\nTEGAN: You’ve found it?\nDOCTOR: Inside the vase.\nTEGAN: Careful.\nDOCTOR: And here it is. Heavy. Now all we have to do is deactivate —\nTEGAN: Oh no.\nDOCTOR: The Jovians. They’re here. .. Come on.\nDOCTOR: FORM. PANIC AMONGST INHABITANTS OF CAMP.\nJOVIAN: We are here to clear this place. We make no apologies.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 117\nDOCTOR: (RUSHING FORWARD) That was unnecessary! Please,\nDOCTOR: to me —\nJOVIAN: Now for these others.\nTEGAN: Doctor, look out!\nTEGAN: stop and talk\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 118"

This is not like them.\nTURLOUGH: (D) Maybe they’re dying out, maybe they need a new planet, maybe their pet dog died and they’re in a bad mood.\nDOCTOR: We must find out what they want.\nST JUDE: (D, OFF) Is he mad?\nTURLOUGH: (D, ASIDE) No, this is how he usually operates.\nDOCTOR: I’1ll find one and ask it. Speak soon.\nST JUDE: (D) What?\nDOCTOR: Now... Violet’s blackout generator.\nTEGAN: How do you get into it? It looks totally sealed.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 124\nDOCTOR: Yes. I could get inside it, but I’d need time and equipment... (BEAT) Help me pull up these floor panels.\nDOCTOR: We need high-insulation cable. These things which look like black hosepipe.\nTEGAN: What for?\nDOCTOR: I’m going to make a shield.\nTEGAN: Out of cable?\nDOCTOR: No, out of the back of one of those chairs. But I need the cable to earth it.\nTEGAN: To absorb the lightning bolts?\nDOCTOR: Exactly.\nTEGAN: But that’s nuts!\nDOCTOR: Thank you for the vote of confidence. Now, strip this end of the cable and wrap it around the blackout generator.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 125\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 73. INT.

You guard the prisoner.\nNASH: Yes, ma’am.\nNYSSA: I can’t believe this is necessary.\nNASH: Look at the strategy. They’re forcing the stragglers higher and higher up the building, so they only have to hold one floor at a time. Of course I helped them plan this.\nNYSSA: Of course you did.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 126\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 74. INT. BREAK ROOM\nDOCTOR: Right. Turn that monitor on so we’1ll know if we’ve managed to deal with the blackout generator.\nTEGAN: Right.\nDOCTOR: Time to let one of our Jovian friends in, I think.\nTEGAN: Will that thing hold together?\nDOCTOR: Yes, but I’m not sure how long for. Whilst the Jovian is recharging I’1ll get somewhere between forty seconds and a minute to talk to it.\nTEGAN: Talk fast.\nDOCTOR: I intend to.\nDOCTOR: Ah, they’ve noticed we’re open. (TO JOVIAN) Hello.\nDOCTOR: Now. Let’s talk.\nJOVIAN: Open the vents. Let me out.\nDOCTOR: Not before —\nAWAY: DOWN CABLE.\nTEGAN: It worked. Your shield actually worked!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 127\nDOCTOR: Of course. (TO JOVIAN) Why are you attacking the settlement?\nJOVIAN: To protect ourselves.\nDOCTOR: From what?\nJOVIAN: We know what Earth wants to do. its energy crisis. Our world is\nTEGAN: What? Is that true?\nDOCTOR: It wouldn’t work. I’ve heard it solar engineering is beyond all\nJOVIAN: The Jupiter Axis.\nDOCTOR: It has found the solution to to become the new sun.\nDOCTOR: suggested, but that kind of but — Who told you this?\nDOCTOR: Aha! I knew you’d never have built a weapon like that off your\nDOCTOR: own bat. I’1l bet the Axis have oversee things, yes?\nJOVIAN: their own man over there to\nJOVIAN: Major Nash is... technically in charge.\nDOCTOR: You’re just here to do his dirty work. Now... I recall there was some tension between Earth and the Jupiter colonies in this period, but I didn’t think it ever came to anything.\nJOVIAN: You are wrong. Negotiations have broken down. War is imminent.\nDOCTOR: Are you sure?\nJOVIAN: We are united against Earth’s plans. We will stop you.\nTEGAN: I don’t think it’s going to take too many more hits like that!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 128\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 75. INT.

Good.\nWALTON: Who are you?\nVIOLET: One moment, please. (TO JOVIAN) Jovian — could you go and fetch something else for me?\nJOVIAN: From the settlement?\nVIOLET: Yes. Here’s the description.\nJOVIAN: Yes. I shall go now.\nWALTON: Don’t I know you?\nVIOLET: You’ve probably seen me around.\nWALTON: Well, I hope you’ve got a plan, because I [can’t go back —]\nVIOLET: Don’t worry, we have a plan.\nWALTON: Good. The gun really isn’t necessary, you [know. ]\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 129\nVIOLET: First — we tidy up a few loose ends.\nVIOLET: Nothing personal. Just the plan.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 130\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 76. INT. BREAK ROOM\nDOCTOR: Listen to me, Jovian. The Axis are trying to set you at odds with Earth. Right now, Earth doesn’t even know you exist — is this really how you want to present yourselves?\nJOVIAN: In a show of strength. They will not dare cross us.\nDOCTOR: But if they knew there were sentient creatures on Jupiter —\nJOVIAN: It would change nothing.\nTEGAN: Doctor, that thing’s not going to [hold. —]\nTEGAN: The blackout generator!\nNEWSREADER: (D) — were not involved in the incident, which occurred in the early hours of the morning.\nDOCTOR: Done it!\nNEWSREADER: (D) More now on today’s dominant story, the new deal between Earth and the Jupiter Axis. Eurasian President Zhang Cheung has just spoken to us about the treaty, which she hails as ‘historic’ and says it offers confidence of peace and prosperity in the years to come.\nDOCTOR: These are the negotiations which you say broke down?\nJOVIAN: This... is not part of the plan.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 131\nST JUDE: (D) Good work, Doctor — we’re sending a distress call to Earth.\nDOCTOR: No — wait. Give me a moment to think.\nDOCTOR: I said let me think!\nJOVIAN: I must talk to my fellows.\nDOCTOR: The timing of this can’t be a coincidence. The Axis have clearly kept this weapon a secret for years, and within hours of a new peace agreement an incident occurs which will expose it to Earth.\nTEGAN: It could threaten the whole deal if Earth found out the Jupiter lot had been building that kind of weapon.\nDOCTOR: Quite — the Axis haven’t owned up to it, so Earth could easily use it as a pretext to invalidate the deal or demand a renegotiation. So let’s say they let someone discover the weapon — they let you in, Tegan. You said you were lucky to get out of there alive.\nTEGAN: So I was meant to come back and tell everyone... and then they sent the Jovians to attack the settlement.\nDOCTOR: Earth will find out that one of their protectorates has been attacked by a previously unknown alien race. The Axis will deny any involvement with you or the weapon.\nJOVIAN: What you say —\nTEGAN: — makes perfect sense. They’re setting you up as the fall guys for that whacking great gun they’ve built. They didn’t set up\nTEGAN: the communications blackout to stop us getting a message out,\nTEGAN: it was to stop you finding out about the peace deal.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 132\nDOCTOR: You've outlived your usefulness, now the Axis will set Earth on you. Earth and the Axis will unite against a common enemy, cementing their new alliance.\nJOVIAN: This is supposition.\nDOCTOR: Convincing, though, isn’t it? And if I’m right, the consequences for you are catastrophic.\nJOVIAN: (BEAT) We have gone too far now. We have [killed —]\nDOCTOR: No. Stop now and we’1ll fight to convince Earth you were misled. It’s never too late to stop killing.\nJOVIAN: (BEAT) Open the door.\nDOCTOR: Thank you.\nTEGAN: I hope you know what you’re doing.\nDOCTOR: The Jovians have been fed misinformation, a concerted campaign to terrify them. They’ve responded by becoming more brutal. Hopefully the truth will make them more reasonable again.\nTEGAN: Do you really think you can convince Earth not to attack them?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know.\nST JUDE: (D) Doctor? Can I send the distress call now?\nDOCTOR: No. Tell them nothing. If Earth calls, don’t pick up the phone.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 133\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 77. INT. WEAPON SITE (OFFICE)\nNYSSA: Don’t you think it’s gone very quiet over at the settlement, Major?\nNASH: Yes.\nNASH: First? (PAUSE) Come in, First.\nNYSSA: Perhaps he’s dead.\nNASH: Nonsense. That place is the worst-defended target I’ve ever tackled. What have they got?\nNYSSA: The Doctor.\nJOVIAN: (D) Nash.\nNASH: There you are, First.\nJOVIAN: (D) Why has a peace accord been announced?\nNASH: A what?\nJOVIAN: (D) You pretend not to know?\nNASH: I don’t! Between who and who?\nJOVIAN: (D) The Axis and Earth. The Doctor broke through your communications blackout.\nNYSSA: I told you.\nNASH: I think I would be the first to know if there was a deal.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 134\nJOVIAN: (D) The Doctor says you are setting us up to take the blame for building this weapon. You wanted Earth to see us this way. But the Doctor will tell them what really happened.\nNASH: This is nonsense. Why do you believe —\nJOVIAN: (D) Goodbye.\nNASH: I don’t understand.\nVIOLET: What don’t you understand?\nNYSSA: Ah, the Lieutenant-Colonel. The Jovians have found out there’s a peace deal between Earth and the Jupiter Axis.\nVIOLET: (SIGHS) So close.\nNASH: What? It’s true?\nVIOLET: Yes, there’s a deal.\nNASH: With Earth?\nVIOLET: Yes. And obviously we don’t want them to know we were building this, [so —]\nNASH: But — this weapon was my life, for four years!\nVIOLET: Sorry. That’s showbiz. (TO NYSSA) Does your Doctor know what he’s doing? This could start a war...\nNYSSA: You brought it on yourselves.\nNASH: When were you going to tell me about this deal?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 135\nVIOLET: The mission was all the more effective for you not knowing about the peace accord. But now I’1l have to go with plan B. Sorry, Major.\nNYSSA: Why are you sorry?\nVIOLET: Because plan B is the old rogue-officer routine.\nNASH: (BEAT) Me?\nVIOLET: You put this operation together in concert with Walton and the Jovians. The Jovians didn’t know you’d gone AWOL years ago. You had a grudge against Earth... we’ll work out the full story on the way home.\nNASH: Home ?\nVIOLET: Yes, we’ll hold the trial when we get back. Don’t worry, it’1l be the cushiest prison you could imagine. We should destabilise the unstable zone too, let this place fall to pieces. Remove Nyssa’s handcuffs, would you? We’1ll need her [for —]\nNASH: No!\nVIOLET: Oh, and if you’re thinking of shooting me, I disabled your gun hours ago. Sorry.\nNASH: (BEAT) It seems I have little option —\nVIOLET: This way is best for everyone, Major — (GRABBED BY THROAT) Aah!\nNASH: . but to see to you with my bare hands!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 136\nNYSSA: (STRUGGLING AGAINST HER HANDCUFFS) No! Please, Major, you mustn’t —\nTAKES: HER GUN.\nNASH: Violet ends in violence. Ha! Now, I’m sure her gun works fine, so I'll kill you too if you try to follow me.\nHUM: AS WEAPON STARTS TO POWER UP.\nNYSSA: Oh no.

But we need evidence that the Jupiter Axis tricked the Jovians. If I’m going to save them, I need to —\nST JUDE: Hello?\nNYSSA: (D) Who’s there?\nTEGAN: Nyssa!\nDOCTOR: It’s good to hear your voice, Nyssa. Are you at the weapon site?\nNYSSA: (D) Yes, and I’m handcuffed to the commanding officer’s desk. I’ve just about managed to reach his communications console.\nTURLOUGH: Where’s the commanding officer?\nNYSSA: (D) In the central control room. He’s locked the whole base down. And he’s preparing to fire the particle cannon at Earth. The countdown says twenty-six minutes.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 138\nDOCTOR: Ah. That’s.. unfortunate.\nST JUDE: We’ve got to warn Earth.\nDOCTOR: Why? There’s no way to defend against a weapon like this, and it’s too late for a preventative strike.\nST JUDE: We’ve got to do something, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Agreed, but even if we avert the strike, there’ll still bea war.\nTEGAN: You said the tension in this time period never comes to anything.\nNYSSA: (D) Maybe that’s because we’re supposed to intervene and make sure it doesn’t. So if we fail...\nTEGAN: No pressure, then.\nDOCTOR: And right now, I can only imagine the peace deal holding if Earth never finds out that the Axis was trying to fire a particle cannon at one of its major cities.\nTURLOUGH: You want to keep this a secret? How?\nDOCTOR: Simple. We use the TARDIS. Nyssa — stay on the line.\nTURLOUGH: (CALLING AFTER) Where are you going? Doctor? Doctor!\nTEGAN: (FOLLOWING DOCTOR) Come on, Turlough!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 139\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 79. INT.

I remember, we were opposite that terrible painting of the girl playing tennis.\nDOCTOR: No, no, no.. we don’t have time to look for it now.\nTURLOUGH: You wanted to use it to get inside the weapon’s control room?\nDOCTOR: Yes. (BEAT) Of course. (CALLS) Jovians!\nTEGAN: You think they took it?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Probably under instructions.\nDOCTOR: Where’s the TARDIS?\nJOVIAN: We do not know.\nDOCTOR: Are you sure? I need it — your former ally is about to fire the cannon at Earth. Tens of millions will die — I can only stop it with the TARDIS.\nJOVIAN: We will search the settlement.\nST JUDE: Do you trust them?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 140\nDOCTOR: We don’t have time not to trust them. In the meantime, we need a back-up plan.\nTURLOUGH: Like what?\nDOCTOR: I’m thinking.\nTEGAN: Well, if we can’t stop it firing, can’t we at least throw its aim off?\nTURLOUGH: How?\nTEGAN: Well, by — (INSPIRED) — changing the course of the comet!\nTURLOUGH: Again... how?\nST JUDE: (HELPFULLY) By blowing a chunk out of it?\nDOCTOR: Unless you’ve got a steering wheel that I wasn’t aware of, that would seem to be the obvious course. Well done, Tegan.\nST JUDE: What?\nDOCTOR: Falcao said you could make bombs with what’s down there. How many bombs?\nST JUDE: Doctor, this place is our livelihoods.\nDOCTOR: How many?\nST JUDE: Enough, all right? We’ve got canisters of cyanogen, if they go up they’1ll detonate the heavy batteries, and then... But it’s not just our jobs, it’s our home.\nDOCTOR: I do realise that.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 141\nST JUDE: (BEAT) How do we do it?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 142\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 80.

(TUTS) Could do with them being less spread out.\nST JUDE: Funnily enough, we planned the storage layout to avoid a major explosion, rather than to cause one.\nTURLOUGH: You were hoping to start a chain reaction?\nDOCTOR: Yes. We don’t have an explosive device capable of triggering this. I can build one, but I don’t have time to make sixteen, which is more like the number we need. One or two explosions won’t cut it — we need something bigger.\nTEGAN: Don’t you have an auto-destruct system?\nST JUDE: Why would we have an auto-destruct system?\nTURLOUGH: How about moving the consignments closer together?\nST JUDE: It’ll take too long. This place isn’t designed for shifting stuff around — we load everything on at the start of the trip, we load everything off at the end.\nDOCTOR: We need a simultaneous timed explosion in multiple locations but we have no explosives and not enough time to... (TAILS OFF)\nTEGAN: What?\nJOVIAN: Doctor. The TARDIS is not inside the settlement.\nDOCTOR: Right. Thank you for trying. (BEAT) There is another way, but I can’t —\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 143\nJOVIAN: We know what you want to ask.\nST JUDE: You want them to trigger the explosion, don’t you.\nTURLOUGH: Five minutes ago Earth were their sworn enemies.\nJOVIAN: We do not know what to believe. But we have no allies now. This strike will be a disaster for us.\nDOCTOR: You see? It’s as much in their interest as ours. (TO JOVIAN) But it will kill you. There’1l be no time to escape.\nJOVIAN: We are not proud of our actions here. We let fear and paranoia overtake us.\nDOCTOR: (BEAT) We can’t predict the effect the explosion will have on the comet’s course. It’s possible that the cannon will still be in position to make a shot, so what we have to do is make sure they don’t have time to correct.\nTEGAN: So we have to leave it to the last minute.\nJOVIAN: I will gather the others.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 144\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 81.

You must have thought I was —\nTEGAN: Never. Not for a second.\nNYSSA: (BEAT) Can you two let go of me now?\nDOCTOR: Yes, of course. Sorry.\nTURLOUGH: But what happened? How did you get out of the handcuffs?\nNYSSA: I had help.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 159\nJOVIAN: I apologise. I was the one who stole your ship. With it, you might have resolved this matter more cleanly.\nDOCTOR: Well, you’ve more than made up for it now.\nTURLOUGH: (TO NYSSA) So you can fly the TARDIS now, can you?\nTEGAN: Yeah, and with rather more precision than its owner.\nDOCTOR: No, you see, when the Unstable Zone collapsed, the Hostile Action Displacement System will have kicked in, and transported the TARDIS to the nearest secure environment. The shuttle. Here.\nNYSSA: Still, had it collapsed a moment sooner, we wouldn’t have been aboard.\nDOCTOR: Yes, well, best not to dwell on that. Time we were leaving.\nJOVIAN: Goodbye, Nyssa.\nNYSSA: Goodbye. And thank you.\nTURLOUGH: That goes for all of us.\nTEGAN: Definitely. You were OK, you guys. In the end.\nDOCTOR: Do you need a lift?\nJOVIAN: I will stay here and travel to Earth.\nDOCTOR: You’re going to reveal yourselves, to humankind?\nJOVIAN: It is time to stop hiding. Our secrecy allowed us to be manipulated — it should not happen again.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE JUPITER CONJUNCTION by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 160\nDOCTOR: But if the colonists tell anyone about your attack on the settlement...\nST JUDE: They won’t.\nDOCTOR: Ah, Chica. Are you quite sure about that?\nST JUDE: Look, if we tell the truth about what happened back there, there’s basically going to be a war. None of us want that. And we all know what your mates did for us. So we’1ll work out the ‘official version’ on the way to Earth.\nJOVIAN: Thank you.\nST JUDE: S’alright. So, you got your ship back.\nDOCTOR: And my friend.\nST JUDE: Brilliant. Well thanks for what you’ve done — I mean, that sounds a bit weak after what you have done, but really... cheers.\nDOCTOR: I’m just sorry about the comet.\nST JUDE: I think our insurance will cover it.\nDOCTOR: Just don’t mention me on the claim.
