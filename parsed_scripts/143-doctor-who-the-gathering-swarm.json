You, er, don’t suppose we’re the reason it’s here, do you?\nDOCTOR: I do. The question is, why?\nEVELYN: What, why is it trying to kill us? Does it really matter?\nDOCTOR: Of course it matters! (BEAT) We can’t risk innocent lives being lost in the crossfire.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 4\nEVELYN: Then what do you suggest?\nDOCTOR: We draw it off! Are you with me, or are you staying here?\nEVELYN: Someone has to keep you out of trouble, don’t they?\nDOCTOR: [SHOUTING] Hoi! Yes, you up there, with the wings! Well, what are you waiting for? Come and get me!\nDOCTOR: BLASTS. EXPLOSIONS. BYSTANDERS CONTINUE TO SCREAM.\nEVELYN: It’s spotted us!\nDOCTOR: Yes... getting ready to strike! Come on, run!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 5\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 2: EXT.

You can’t go through here, mate, we’re closed for the night, you’ve missed the last ferry!\nDOCTOR: You see that giant flying insect back there, the one that’s chasing us?\nDOCTOR: PAUSE.\nGUARD: Alright, I’m letting you through, but just this once.\nDOCTOR: Very kind. Evelyn, this way! No time to lose!\nDOCTOR: INDISCRIMINATELY IN B/G.\nEVELYN: The Thames! What do you suggest we do now? Swim for it?\nDOCTOR: Have you ever known me not to have a plan?

Cast us off, could you?\nEVELYN: Yes, Captain!\nEVELYN: LIFE.\nDOCTOR: Hold on tight, Miss Smythe — here we go!\nEVELYN: You know how to drive a speedboat?\nDOCTOR: Of course!

Woah!\nEVELYN: [NOT INTERESTED] Really? How interesting!\nDOCTOR: Yes.. and to the left here, you’ll see the banks where, in Victorian times, you’d find mudlarks, young children, scavenging for jetsam. And on your right, (the) —\nEVELYN: This isn’t really the time to play at being a tour guide, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Hold on! Duuuck!\nEVELYN: I don’t think it’s going to give up.\nDOCTOR: No. Unless... [HAS IDEA] Yes, it has to be worth a try! Evelyn, take the wheel for a moment, could you?\nEVELYN: Why are you taking off your coat? Are you planning on challenging it to a fist-fight?\nDOCTOR: If I’m right, that thing only has a limited capacity to process visual data, or it would have ‘zapped’ us by now. So, give it too much visual stimulation, and with any luck -\nEVELYN: - it’ll have a brain-storm?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 9\nDOCTOR: Precisely. It can only cope with so many colours and patterns at once!\nEVELYN: But how do you intend to give it too much ‘visual stimulation’ - [REALISES] Your coat!\nDOCTOR: Can you think of anything better?\nEVELYN: No. I knew there had to be a reason for you wearing it!\nDOCTOR: Other than fashion, you mean? Get ready to slow down, it’s circling for another dive —\nEVELYN: What if this doesn’t work?\nDOCTOR: We’ll soon find out! Here it comes!\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR FLAPS HIS COAT URGENTLY. DURING THIS, THE BOAT’S ENGINE SPUTTERS AND DIES AND IT COMES TO A HALT.\nDOCTOR: That’s it, a little closer, my muscid friend, and — olé!\nDOCTOR: BUZZ, BUT NOW IT’S WHIRRING AND CLANKING AND CHITTERING, AS IF BROKEN. IT’S SAYING THE WORD ‘DOCTOR’, BUT UNINTELLIGIBLY.\nEVELYN: Is it dead?\nDOCTOR: Stunned. The visual over-stimulation has rendered it temporarily unconscious.\nEVELYN: Not the first time your coat’s had that effect.\nDOCTOR: I shall pretend I didn’t hear that. [EXAMINING ROBOT] Let’s have a look at you, shall we? See what makes you tick! [REACTS] Oh, beautiful. Absolutely beautiful!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 10\nEVELYN: Do you recognise it?\nDOCTOR: No. [EXAMINES IT] Extremely advanced technology, non- terrestrial obviously... a gravity inversion drive...\nDOCTOR: Ah. Oh dear.\nEVELYN: What does that flashing red light mean?\nDOCTOR: It means it’s been designed to prevent people like me from poking around. It’s going to self-destruct!\nEVELYN: Can you stop it?

[]\nBRADSHAW: Yes, we’re getting ready to pick them up.\nBRADSHAW: SCENE 6: INT. POLICE INCIDENT ROOM\nMENZIES: Delighted to hear it, Sergeant. What about this remote- controlled device?\nBRADSHAW: (VIA RADIO) Gone, there’s no sign of it, must’ve been caught in the explosion.\nMENZIES: Well, keep an eye out for any more, you never know.\nBRADSHAW: (VIA RADIO)\nBRADSHAW: Coming into land... now. Got a visual on the offenders. Sending a photo over to you. One male, mid-forties, one female, fifties.\nMENZIES: Got it. [BEAT, THEN ANNOYED] Well, nice to see it was worth me\nMENZIES: coming down here.\nBRADSHAW: (VIA RADIO) What do you mean, sir?\nMENZIES: Unfortunately for all of us Sergeant, you’ve found the feller we've been looking for. That’s the Doctor!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 12\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 7: INT. POLICE CELL\nMENZIES: Before we start, can I get you anything? Coffee? Tea?\nDOCTOR: No, I’m fine, thank you. Though I’m not sure about these clothes you’ve given me —\nMENZIES: Well we can stick the jumper and jeans back in Lost Property if you like, but if we do you’1ll have to sit here starkers.\nDOCTOR: Put like that... I’m very grateful.\nMENZIES: Now, let’s not waste time, Doctor, it’s two o’clock in the morning, I’ve had a long night. What’s going on?\nDOCTOR: Doctor? I don’t recall telling you my name. In fact, I don’t recall you telling me your name?\nMENZIES: You don’t know who I am?\nDOCTOR: No, I’m sorry, you have me at a disadvantage.\nMENZIES: Detective Inspector Patricia Menzies. And as for how I happen to know your name —\nDOCTOR: Yes?\nMENZIES: (THINKING ON HER FEET) Your, um, lady friend told me, she said you were called -\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 13\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 8: INT. POLICE CELL (FLASHBACK)\nEVELYN: Smith. Doctor John Smith.\nMENZIES: Really? Doctor John Smith? Don’t make me laugh.\nEVELYN: I wouldn’t dream of attempting such a feat, my dear.\nMENZIES: I know the Doctor. And I know that’s not his real name.\nEVELYN: You do?\nMENZIES: I’ve had the pleasure of his company before.\nEVELYN: He’s never mentioned you.\nMENZIES: He never mentioned you either, Miss ‘Evelyn Smythe’. So what happened to Charlotte Pollard?\nEVELYN: I’m sorry, who?\nMENZIES: Forget it, not important. So, you travel with the Doctor?\nEVELYN: Yes.\nMENZIES: And what are you doing here?\nEVELYN: We were visiting the Tower of London — the Doctor’s idea. This giant mosquito just turned up out of nowhere and started blasting away -\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 14\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 9: INT. POLICE CELL\nDOCTOR: — with little regard for the safety of passers-by! It was clearly targeting Evelyn and I, so we had no choice but to lure it away.\nMENZIES: Which is why you stole a high-speed patrol boat.\nDOCTOR: Borrowed.\nMENZIES: You didn’t exactly leave it in the condition you found it.\nDOCTOR: Not my fault. The mechanical assassin was booby-trapped. I’m sure you find it all rather difficult to believe -\nMENZIES: Not really.\nDOCTOR: Oh.\nMENZIES: I’m a trusting sort, Doctor. Not a cynical bone in my body. Plus, your story tallies with eyewitness reports, including that of our own officer.\nDOCTOR: Good! (FX: STANDS UP, PUSHES CHAIR) So I can go, then?\nMENZIES: No.\nDOCTOR: Well, why not? (FX: SITS DOWN AGAIN)\nMENZIES: Because, Doctor, that’s not what I meant when I asked what you were doing here. You’re really saying you don’t know?\nDOCTOR: (THINKING) Menzies... are you sure we haven’t met?\nMENZIES: (THINKING ON HER FEET) No. I’ve never seen you before in my life.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 15\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 10: INT. POLICE INCIDENT ROOM\nBRADSHAW: I thought you said you knew him.\nMENZIES: I do. (FX: CABINET DRAWER OPENED, FILES BEING LEAFED THROUGH. ) But either he’s pretending not to know me for some reason, or he’s lost his memory — or... (FX: PICKING OUT FILE.) Yeah, here we are. Bradshaw, look at this photo of the Doctor, from the Ackley House business.\nBRADSHAW: You're right, it’s the same guy, so what?\nMENZIES: Is it just me or does he look younger now than he did then?\nBRADSHAW: Er.. maybe. There’s not a lot in it — five years or so. Do you think he’s had a facelift or something?\nMENZIES: Yeah, or Botox, that’s probably it.\nBRADSHAW: Probably? What other answer is there?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 16\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 11: INT. POLICE CELL\nMENZIES: You and the Doctor, you both travel in a time machine. Please don’t bother trying to deny it.\nEVELYN: I wasn’t intending to.\nMENZIES: So although I’ve already met the Doctor, as far as he’s concerned, he hasn’t met me yet. Do you follow?\nEVELYN: Not really, no.\nMENZIES: I mean, at some point in the Doctor’s future, he’s going to run into me, which for me was a couple of years ago.\nEVELYN: When he was travelling with this Pollard girl?\nMENZIES: Yeah, but that’s just it, you see. Forget I told you that. Don’t mention any of this to the Doctor.\nEVELYN: Because if he knew about his own future... oh, I see.\nMENZIES: Charlotte Pollard had the same problem. She met him out of order too, and she told me it could’ve caused a hell of a mess if she’d have let on. (THINKING IT THROUGH) It means, though, that when I met the Doctor for the first time in Manchester, he must’ve been pretending not to know me. Oh, very clever, Doctor!\nEVELYN: To avoid letting on that he would meet you again - now?\nMENZIES: Exactly. Which means I have to repay the favour.\nEVELYN: You mean... pretend not to know him?\nMENZIES: And you have to play along. He can’t know.\nEVELYN: If you say so. You seem to have this all worked out.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 17\nMENZIES: After the last time I met the Doctor, I thought I should do some research. Well, I read The Time Traveler’s Wife, alright? Well, I got out the DVD - Well, I watched the first ten minutes. But the point is, if the Doctor asks... I’ve never met him before.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 18\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 12: INT. POLICE CELL\nDOCTOR: Can you please explain what it is you think I’ve done?\nMENZIES: Okay. It’s like this. The Met have been getting reports of some new gang that’s been set up in East London. Led by a fella calling himself ‘the Doctor’.\nDOCTOR: Interesting.\nMENZIES: Nobody’s sure what they’re up to. So far it’s just been odd bits of theft here and there, but his gang seems to be getting bigger and bigger. This ‘Doctor’ seems to be building up to something more ambitious.\nDOCTOR: Well, I’m sorry — Patricia, wasn’t it? But whoever this ‘Doctor’ is, it’s not me. I’ve only recently arrived in London — and so have you, I gather.\nMENZIES: Why do you say that?\nDOCTOR: Your ID card says you’re with the Greater Manchester Police. So, you have a special interest in this case?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 19\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 13: INT. CORRIDOR\nBRADSHAW: So did you tell him why you’d been seconded down here?\nMENZIES: (FX: COLLECTING COFFEE) Because of my ‘experience’ and ‘history’ of dealing with mysterious figures who call themselves ‘the Doctor’? No, I just told him there’d been some related activity in Manchester. (SIPS COFFEE) Oh my God, this coffee tastes of Bovril.\nBRADSHAW: Yeah, if you want coffee you have to press for tea. (FX: THEY WALK) So you don’t think it’s the same guy running the East End mob?\nMENZIES: (WALKING) No. He denies all knowledge, and for what it’s worth, I believe him.\nBRADSHAW: Sounds like you had a wasted journey down the M6.\nMENZIES: No, he’s definitely ‘my’ Doctor — and after what happened last night, he’s definitely mixed up in something... even if he doesn’t know what it is yet.\nBRADSHAW: (STOPPING) So, what next?\nMENZIES: Hold them in custody — if someone’s out to kill them, a night in the cells would seem to be the safest thing.\nBRADSHAW: I’1ll see to it.\nMENZIES: Now, if you’1l excuse me, it’s been a hell of night, and I have to go home, eat a microwave curry, and do my best to forget about the insanity that is my life.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 20\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 14: INT. POLICE CELL/CORRIDOR\nBRADSHAW: Alright, up!\nDOCTOR: (WAKING) What time is it? It must be.. five in the morning?\nBRADSHAW: Yeah, sorry to disturb your beauty sleep, but we’ve just had word, you’re to be moved.\nDOCTOR: Moved?\nBRADSHAW: The call came in a couple of minutes ago. It seems someone in the security services wants a chat with you.\nDOCTOR: You mean, MI5?\nBRADSHAW: (SARCASTIC) No, the boy scouts, who do you think?\nEVELYN: Doctor! Thank goodness!\nDOCTOR: Evelyn, are you alright?\nEVELYN: Fine, apart from a couple of hours spent failing to get to sleep in a police cell — and then, the moment I drop off, being woken up by this oaf.\nBRADSHAW: (DISMISSIVE) I’m afraid I didn’t catch that, miss.\nEVELYN: Would you like me to repeat it, louder and more clearly?\nBRADSHAW: Just keep moving, the sooner you’re off my hands, the happier for all of us.\nDOCTOR: affair.\nDOCTOR: identical\nEVELYN: you say?\nCUT TO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 21\nCUT TO: (JOKING) I like your new outfit, Doctor.\nCUT TO: Hmmm, yes - one of more distressing parts of this\nCUT TO: Your coat, it was destroyed in the explosion?\nCUT TO: Yes. But never fear, Evelyn. I have another dozen coats, back in the TARDIS!\nCUT TO: [SARCASTIC] Oh, that is good news. Another dozen,\nCUT TO: What, did you think I always wore the same one?\nCUT TO: (TO HERSELF) One down, twelve to go...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 22\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 15. EXT. POLICE STATION YARD/INT. CAR\nDOCTOR WHO: BIRDSONG, DISTANT BIN LORRIES, BUSES.\nBRADSHAW: Right then, you two. Your chauffeur awaits.\nEVELYN: (WALKING) Our own police car? I’m honoured.\nBRADSHAW: Yeah, yeah. In.\nEVELYN: (CLIMBING IN) Where are we going, again?\nDOCTOR: (CLIMBING IN) We’re expected at Thames house, I believe.\nBRADSHAW: (TO DRIVER) Okay, mate, from now on, they’re your problem. Have fun!\nDOCTOR: Now, officer, I wonder if I could ask a favour? I have this vehicle, you see, parked at Monument...\nDOCTOR: THE DRIVER IS A ROUGH-HEWN COCKNEY CALLED MICK.\nMICK: Naah. Mister Gallagher doesn’t like to be kept waiting.\nEVELYN: Gallagher? Is he something to do with MI5?\nMICK: (DRY LAUGH) You’re not going to MI5, miss.\nMICK: Now, sit back and shut up. Try anything... and I guarantee that at least one of you’ll get hurt.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 23\nEVELYN: (SOTTO) Doctor, we’re being kidnapped!\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) Yes. Exciting, isn’t it? But if this Mister Gallagher is so keen to meet us, I’m rather keen to meet him! (LOUDER) Drive on, driver! (BEAT) Evelyn, seatbelt!\nDOCTOR: FADE/MUSIC TO:\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 24\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 16: EXT. STREET IN BERMONDSEY/INT. LOCK-UP GARAGE\nEVELYN: Where are we?\nDOCTOR: Bermondsey, I think. Of course, I remember when it was all [fields —]\nMICK: (FX: OPENING REAR DOOR) Alright, enough sightseeing - out!\nDOCTOR: And would you like me to put my hands up, making no sudden movements?\nMICK: No, what I’d like is for you to try and escape, giving me a\nMICK: reason to shoot you.\nEVELYN: Charming.\nMICK: Mister Gallagher? I’ve got ‘em for you.\nGALLAGHER: (SEES THEM) Who the hell are these two?\nMICK: This one’s the Doctor. The guy you were after.\nGALLAGHER: I don’t know who this man is, but he isn’t the Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Actually, I am [known as —]\nMICK: Shut it! This is the guy the police were holding. I got him, like you said.\nGALLAGHER: You sure about that? Think carefully before you answer.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 25\nMICK: Yeah. Yeah, I am sure.\nDOCTOR: If I may be of assistance, your employee didn’t make a mistake - I am the Doctor.\nGALLAGHER: Really? Well, you’re not the Doctor I’m after. The one I’m after has been running a little outfit that’s been muscling in on my business.\nEVELYN: Your ‘business’?\nGALLAGHER: Let me put it this way. Lots of good, honest citizens pay me their hard-earned money to make sure they’re protected from the more... uncivilised element. And it doesn’t look too good if they then find themselves having to hand over their valuables to a guy with a sawn-off shotgun. Am I making myself clear?\nEVELYN: Abundantly.\nGALLAGHER: I’m so glad. But if you’re not the Doctor I’m looking for, who are you?\nDOCTOR: Just a humble civilian. So, if you’d care to release us?\nGALLAGHER: Well, now, that’s the thing, you see. If you were the Doctor I was after, I’d let Mick take you outside and let him indulge his homicidal tendencies.\nDOCTOR: But, as I’m clearly the innocent victim of a case of mistaken identity —\nGALLAGHER: You give me something of a problem. A problem with one very obvious solution...\nDOCTOR: A solution that involves Mick taking me outside, and —\nGALLAGHER: Well done, you’ve read my mind.\nEVELYN: You could just let us go.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 26\nGALLAGHER: I could, but then you’d go running back to the police, and that wouldn’t be very good for my piece of mind. I get these terrible attacks of angina, you see, so it’s very important I lead a stress-free life. No, either I let Mick use you for target practice, or...\nDOCTOR: Or?\nGALLAGHER: Or your lady friend agrees to do me a little favour.\nGALLAGHER: FADE/MUSIC TO:\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 27\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 17: INT. POLICE INCIDENT ROOM\nMENZIES: What do you mean they’re not here, Bradshaw?\nBRADSHAW: We got a call about five A.M., from Thames House. Transfer request, top priority, under the P.O.T.A.\nMENZIES: Let me see. (BEAT) Well, where’s the request form?\nBRADSHAW: Um, it hasn’t actually come through yet, Ma’am -\nMENZIES: I don’t believe it. Someone phones up, no codeword, and you just do as they say!\nBRADSHAW: They sent a squad car, I put them in it myself. It all seemed perfectly routine -\nMENZIES: Brilliant. A squad car like the one that was stolen from Surrey Quays early this morning?\nBRADSHAW: What?\nMENZIES: The officer was lucky to escape with his life. They took his uniform and dumped him by the side of the road.\nBRADSHAW: But how could they know, that we [were holding —?]\nMENZIES: They must’ve been listening in on our radios. Oh, this is my perfect morning! Do you have any idea how much paper-work has to be filled in to have somebody formally reprimanded?\nBRADSHAW: No.\nMENZIES: Fortunately for you, I do, which is why I’m not going to bother. Our first priority is the location of that stolen car, assuming it’s not already at the bottom of the Thames...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 28\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 18: EXT. THAMES RIVERSIDE\nMICK: One... two... and push!\nGALLAGHER: Now: Doctor, and your lady friend — into the other car.\nMICK: You heard the boss.\nDOCTOR: (SHOVED) Alright, there’s no need to poke a gun in my ribs -\nEVELYN: Where are you taking us?\nGALLAGHER: Nowhere, just yet. (FX: STOPPING BESIDE CAR.) I want you to do a little job for me, Miss —\nEVELYN: Smythe.\nGALLAGER: Miss Smythe. You see, the reason why I know your chum isn’t the man I’m after is because I’ve recently made contact with the real Doctor. Turns out, he’s in the market for firepower.\nDOCTOR: Firepower?\nGALLAGHER: Heavy-grade stuff, too, machine guns, semi-automatics. He’s planning something major. So I’ve let it be known that I have the, ah, necessary items.\nEVELYN: You’re intending to give him what he wants?\nGALLAGHER: First I want to find out what he wants them for. Nobody knows what he’s planning, see. This ‘Doctor’ guy popped up out of nowhere, nobody knows a thing about him.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 29\nDOCTOR WHO: Almost as if he just arrived from another planet?\nGALLAGHER: Yeah, if you like. We don’t even know what he looks like. So I thought I’d try to get someone on the inside.\nEVELYN: Me?\nGALLAGHER: Yep. I was going to send one of my boys, but you can take the risk on their behalf.\nEVELYN: Won't he be slightly suspicious? I hardly resemble a gangster!\nGALLAGHER: So much the better. One of the funny things about the Doctor’s mob is that they don’t fit the usual profile. He’s been sending out primary school teachers to wave shotguns in poker dens, all very odd.\nEVELYN: (JUSTIFIABLY OFFENDED) And how do I report back to you?\nGALLAGHER: You wear this.\nEVELYN: A hidden microphone?\nGALLAGHER: Wired for sound. So you’d better be careful because, as the saying goes, careless talk costs lives.\nEVELYN: You mean if I don’t co-operate, or contact the police —\nDOCTOR: - I'll be joining that car at the bottom of the Thames.\nGALLAGHER: Nail on the head. Well, what do you say, Miss Smythe?\nEVELYN: I think, Mister Gallagher, you’ve made me an offer I can’t\nEVELYN: refuse.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 30\nGALLAGHER: Very wise. Get in, Miss Smythe. Mick here will fit you with the microphone, it’s the same kind the police use.\nEVELYN: So how did you get hold of it?\nGALLAGHER: I think that’s one question you probably don’t want to hear the answer to. Now, if you’ll excuse me a minute, I have to let the Doctor’s people know you’re on your way.\nEVELYN: (SOTTO, THROUGH WINDOW) Doctor, what have we got ourselves mixed up in?\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO, THROUGH WINDOW) I don’t know. A robot mosquito tries to kill us, and it turns out there’s another ‘doctor’ on the scene...\nEVELYN: (SOTTO, THROUGH WINDOW) You don’t think, this other ‘doctor’ — it might be you?\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO, THROUGH WINDOW) Buying up heavy artillery certainly doesn’t sound like my style - and I don’t remember ever being involved in these sort of shenanigans...\nEVELYN: (SOTTO, THROUGH WINDOW) So it’s not you? It’s definitely somebody else?\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO, THROUGH WINDOW) I didn’t say that. It could be one of my future selves. I wouldn’t put it past them! But if it is me — then what am I up to? Why would I be running an East-End\nDOCTOR: gang?\nEVELYN: (SOTTO, THROUGH WINDOW) Well, it’s up to me to find out...\nMICK: (FX: OPENING DRIVERS’ DOOR, GETTING IN) Enough rabbit, you two. Time to go, Miss.\nDOCTOR: Take care, Evelyn.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 31\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 19: INT. GALLAGHER’S OFFICE\nGALLAGHER: Alright, Miss Smythe. Where are you now?\nGALLAGHER: RUSTLE AND BUSTLE AS SHE WALKS.\nEVELYN: (VIA RADIO)\nEVELYN: (WALKING) I’m crossing the waste ground, heading towards the old factory. It’s overgrown with weeds and nettles. Thank goodness I’m wearing trousers, that’s all I can say!\nGALLAGHER: Good grief, this is like listening to the Archers. Any sign of the Doctor?\nEVELYN: (VIA RADIO) No, it seems to be deserted. The whole place is a ruin, half the floors are missing. It doesn’t look very safe.\nGALLAGHER: Your girlfriend’s sharp as a tack, isn’t she?\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) She’s not my girlfriend.\nGALLAGHER: Alright then, your mum. Like it matters.\nDOCTOR: I’m warning you, if anything happens to her -\nGALLAGHER: What? What are you gonna do? The only reason you’re alive is to ensure Miss Smythe’s co-operation. If she dies then you’re surplus to requirements. (BEAT) Where are you now, Miss Smthe?\nEVELYN: (VIA RADIO) I’m heading up the stairs, following the directions, out onto the first floor...\nGALLAGHER: Any sign of the Doctor?\nEVELYN: (VIA RADIO) No... it’s too dark, can barely see where I’m treading. I think I can see rats. But apart from that...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 32\nDOCTOR WHO: ROBOT MOSQUITOS OUTSIDE GALLAGHER’S BUILDING.\nDOCTOR: Maybe there’s no-one there?\nGALLAGHER: Or they’re watching her, waiting to make their move.\nDOCTOR: Yes, or — shhhh. Can you hear that?\nGALLAGHER: Hear what?\nDOCTOR: Buzzing.\nGALLAGHER: Must be the radio.\nEVELYN: (VIA RADIO) I think... yes, I can see someone! They’re here, waiting for me.\nGALLAGHER: Who is it? Describe them.\nEVELYN: (VIA RADIO) It’s hard to see, but it seems to be a young man, about twenty years old I think. Fair hair. He’s wearing — now that’s odd —\nDOCTOR: What’s odd?\nEVELYN: (VIA RADIO) It’s an Edwardian outfit - like he’s just walked out of the pages of an Evelyn Waugh novel...\nDOCTOR: What? But that... that’s impossible.\nGALLAGHER: What’s [impossible-? ]\nGALLAGHER: BY THE SOUND OF THE ROBOT MOSQUITOS ATTACKING — SEVERAL OF THEM FIRING LASER BOLTS WITH GUNSHOTS RETURNING FIRE.\nGALLAGHER: What the hell’s going on?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 33\nMICK: There’s half a dozen of them, attacking the top of the building, firing these laser beam things!\nGALLAGHER: Them? What are they, toy helicopters?\nMICK: More like — giant insects. [BEAT] Oh, my life! Get down!\nDOCTOR: The same creatures as the one that came after me yesterday!\nGALLAGHER: What? You know about these things?\nDOCTOR: No. But I think I know what it is they’re after!\nGALLGHER: What?\nDOCTOR: Me!\nDOCTOR: FADE/MUSIC TO:\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 34\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 20: INT. DESERTED FACTORY\nDOCTOR WHO: DISUSED STOREROOM, FOOTSTEPS ON CONCRETE. DRIPPING WATER.\nEVELYN: (WHISPERING INTO MICROPHONE) Hello! Are you there? Mister Gallagher? Doctor? Can you hear me? Hello?\nBREWSTER: (FROM THE FAR END OF THE STOREROOM) Okay, lady, that’s far enough.\nEVELYN: Oh my goodness, you made me jump. Who are you?\nBREWSTER: Me? I’m the Doctor.\nBREWSTER: END OF PART ONE\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 35"

So, he’s going to do your friend in if you don’t come up with the goods?\nEVELYN: If he hasn’t done so already.\nBREWSTER: Look, I might as well come clean. I’m not some sort of gangster either.\nEVELYN: No?\nBREWSTER: No, I mean — look at me!

SQUAD CAR\nMENZIES: So who do you think this ‘Doctor’ guy is?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know, but based on what Evelyn said... there’s a strong possibility that he might be me!\nMENZIES: Okay...\nDOCTOR: You see, the truth is... I’m a time-traveller.\nMENZIES: Yeah. [BEAT; REALISES A BIGGER REACTION NEEDED] Oh my God, really?\nDOCTOR: Yes. And I might have crossed my own footsteps. I try not to, but when you travel as much as I do, well, you’re bound to bump into yourself now and then.\nMENZIES: But the guy Evelyn described, he was nothing like you.\nDOCTOR: The thing is, sometimes I don’t look like me either.\nMENZIES: That has to be the clearest and simplest explanation of anything I’ve ever heard in my life.\nDOCTOR: I have this ability, to change my appearance.\nMENZIES: What, like plastic surgery, making you look younger?\nDOCTOR: More than that. You’d swear that I was an entirely new man.\nMENZIES: Okay, this is obviously insane, but what the hell.. This other Doctor is you, but with a new face?\nDOCTOR: Going by the description it’s either my previous incarnation - or some future persona.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 46\nMENZIES: I’m glad we’ve got it narrowed down. But if this other ‘Doctor’ is a former you, shouldn’t you remember all this?\nDOCTOR: I should - unless I’m suffering from temporal amnesia!\nMENZIES: Oh right. Inconvenient.\nDOCTOR: Yes..

What is it, a revenge thing?\nTERRAVORE: That information is restricted.\nGALLAGHER: Okay, your prerogative mate, just expressing an interest!\nTERRAVORE: You will co-operate in eliminating Doctor.\nGALLAGHER: You’re proposing we join forces? What’s in it for me?\nTERRAVORE: These organic remains are of no utility?\nGALLAGHER: You mean — Mick? No. Why, what — [are you going to do?]\nGALLAGHER: Oh my sweet Lord.\nTERRAVORE: Carbon molecular content reconstituted.\nGALLAGHER: That’s a diamond.

SQUAD CAR\nDOCTOR: Gallagher told us this Doctor’s mob aren’t your usual gangsters.\nMENZIES: Yep. Housewives, students, mostly unemployed or retired, even a community support officer! It makes no sense. None of them has any sort of criminal past, they were all law-abiding citizens, and then pretty much overnight they walked out on their families and jobs and joined up with the Doctor...\nDOCTOR: You think he’s brainwashing them?\nMENZIES: Maybe, but more to the point, why recruit the lady who sorts the stock down at Oxfam for an underworld gang?\nDOCTOR: Do you have details of all the people who have gone missing? I’d like to take a look, see if there might be a pattern.\nMENZIES: You're welcome, we’re heading back to the station now.\nDOCTOR: Could I ask one more favour? If we’re crossing at London Bridge, my vehicle is parked nearby...\nMENZIES: Sergeant, make a detour - the Doctor seems to think we’re\nMENZIES: running a taxi service...\nMENZIES: FADE/MUSIC TO:\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 50\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 32: INT.

You drop that stuff, you’1ll be walking around with no legs!\nEVELYN: So where are you taking all these weapons?\nBREWSTER: You’re full of questions, aren’t you, Miss?\nEVELYN: I have an inquiring mind, ‘Doctor’. If that is your name.\nBREWSTER: What are you on about? (SHOUT) Okay, get the doors!\nEVELYN: I was only wondering if you intended to use them against the Daleks.\nBREWSTER: Daleks? Who are the Daleks?\nEVELYN: That settles it! You’re not the Doctor.\nBREWSTER: No no, I remember now — Billy and Terry Dalek, the notorious Dalek brothers. Of course.\nEVELYN: I knew it. The Doctor would never countenance the use of guns. Nor would he run a criminal mob. You’re clearly an imposter!\nBREWSTER: Well, ain’t that interesting? Cos the only way you could know that would be if you knew the real Doctor. (TO GANG) Okay, if we've got everything, into the van!\nEVELYN: You admit it then?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 51\nBREWSTER: Is he around somewhere? Where is he? Where’s the Doctor?\nEVELYN: As if I would tell you that. Who are you, really?\nBREWSTER: An old friend of the Doctor’s. We got back a long way, him and me. You could say we have history.\nEVELYN: Really?\nBREWSTER: Enough chatter, Miss. Into the van.\nEVELYN: What?\nBREWSTER: Get into the van!

I like it.\nDOCTOR: I’m gratified it meets with your approval.\nMENZIES: Why aren’t there any chairs?\nDOCTOR: What?\nMENZIES: There’s no chairs, where do you sit?\nDOCTOR: This is the ship’s bridge, the control room, the nerve centre. Not a place for rest and relaxation!\nMENZIES: I’m just saying, on Captain Kirk’s ship they have chairs.\nDOCTOR: Detective Inspector, may I tell you something, and I can’t stress this too strongly... I am not Captain Kirk.\nMENZIES: So what are you doing?\nDOCTOR: If another of my selves is active in the vicinity, I should be able to detect traces of their TARDIS.\nMENZIES: You mean their Police Box?\nDOCTOR: Precisely.\nDOCTOR: FADE/MUSIC TO:\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 54\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 35: INT.

Which incarnation?\nBREWSTER: Which what?\nEVELYN: You do know the Doctor can change his appearance?\nBREWSTER: [COVERING] Course I do, yeah. Everyone knows that.\nEVELYN: I suppose that’s why you’re dressed in those ridiculous clothes. Very ‘Brideshead Revisited’!\nBREWSTER: Yeah, well, it’s what’s expected, isn’t it?\nEVELYN: By whom? Who exactly are you trying to impress?\nBREWSTER: Okay, we’re here. Everybody out!\nEVELYN: Whoever they are, I’m surprised they haven’t smelled a rat. I mean, where’s your TARDIS?\nBREWSTER: My what?\nEVELYN: Your time machine? Don’t tell me - you’ve bought a garden shed and painted it blue!\nBREWSTER: You’d be surprised. (SHOUTS) Okay, Trish, Nigel, start unloading.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 55\nBREWSTER: C’mon. Out.\nEVELYN: (CLIMBING OUT OF VAN) Where are we, anyway? This is Marylebone, isn’t it?\nBREWSTER: What’s it to you?\nEVELYN: The entrance to an underground car park. Not very picturesque.\nBREWSTER: If you’re hoping your ‘Doctor’s gonna come to your rescue, you can forget it.\nEVELYN: Really?\nBREWSTER: (MUFFLED, IN VAN) What’re you playing at, you daft old bat-?\nEVELYN: (RUNNING OFF) Stop! Help! There’s a man after me, he tried to mug me, call the police!\nBREWSTER: Oh, nice try. (TO COLLEAGUE) Trish. Keep loading the stuff into the ventilation tunnel. You know what to do.

But.. hello - that’s odd!\nMENZIES: What’s odd?\nDOCTOR: It’s not a TARDIS... but someone does seem to have activated a time machine!\nMENZIES: Oh, a time machine. I thought it might have been something bad.\nDOCTOR: Oh, it is bad, Patricia.

Hold the doors!\nEVELYN: BEEPING NOISE.\nJARED: You alright, miss?\nEVELYN: Thank you, young man — and no, I’m not alright, there’s someone chasing me...\nJARED: It’s okay, love, we’re moving. [BEAT] Here, you can take my seat if you want.\nFLIP: Jared, what’s going on?\nJARED: This old dear thinks some bloke’s after her.\nFLIP: No way! Are you okay?\nEVELYN: I’ll be fine, once I get my breath back. Thank you. And I’11 have you know that I’m not an ‘old dear’ quite yet!\nEVELYN: TRAIN P/A ANNOUNCEMENT: The next station is Great Portland Street. The next station is Great Portland Street.\nEVELYN: GROWS LOUDER, SHAKING AND RATTLING OMINOUSLY.\nJARED: Hey, Flip, check out the guy in the next carriage.\nFLIP: What guy?\nJARED: The one in fancy dress...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 59\nEVELYN: Oh no. He must’ve followed me.\nJARED: That’s the guy who was chasing you? Caractacus Potts?\nEVELYN: He mustn’t see me.\nFLIP: He’s heading down the carriage, I’d get off at the next stop if I was you.\nJARED: Now you mention it, shouldn’t we be slowing down for the next stop? I’d swear we were getting faster!\nJARED: ROAR. PASSENGERS BEGIN TO SCREAM IN TERROR.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 60\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 39: INT. TARDIS CONTROL ROOM\nMENZIES: I’m guessing that noise isn’t good news either.\nDOCTOR: It means someone’s just smashed a hole in the fabric of the universe. A temporal breach!\nMENZIES: And one of those is?\nDOCTOR: A wormhole, Detective Menzies, a space-time wormhole!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 61\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 40: INT. TUBE CARRIAGE\nDOCTOR WHO: MUTTERING, CHATTERING AND SCREAMING IN ALARM.\nFLIP: Jared, what’s happening?\nJARED: Don’t ask me! The rate this thing’s going, I’m surprised it hasn’t fallen to pieces!\nJARED: CRASH OF LIGHTING.\nEVELYN: We’re slowing down, thank goodness.\nFLIP: But that’s... daylight! It’s daylight outside! Where are we?\nJARED: Looks like... a tropical jungle. (WHISTLE IN AWE)\nFLIP: But this is meant to be Great Portland Street tube! Not the middle of the Amazonian Rainforest!\nFLIP: BUT NO ORDINARY JUNGLE — IT GURGLES AND BELCHES LIKE MUD, WITH STRANGE ALIEN GROANS AND SHRIEKS.\nEVELYN: I think we’ve gone further than that... look at the sky!\nJARED: What? Two moons.. two moons! And stars, loads of stars!\nFLIP: I don’t get it, Jared, what is it?\nEVELYN: Isn’t it obvious? We’re on an alien planet.\nEVELYN: JUNGLE, WITH STRANGE WHOOPS, CHITTERS, RUSTLING LEAVES.\nBREWSTER: (ENTERING CARRIAGE) Miss Smythe. Glad I caught up with you.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 62\nEVELYN: Where are we?\nBREWSTER: End of the line. Welcome - to the planet Symbios!

The temporal breach appears to be located in Great Portland Street!\nMENZIES: You’re joking, right?\nDOCTOR: Right next to the Underground Station! Unfortunately, trying to investigate in the TARDIS would be like flying into a hurricane.\nMENZIES: Is this your way of asking for another lift?\nDOCTOR: It would save me having to take the bus.\nMENZIES: Okay, open the doors. Let’s go.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 64\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 42: EXT. MONUMENT\nDOCTOR: I do apologise, Detective-Inspector, if I appear to be using you as some kind of taxi service.\nMENZIES: Yeah, just call me a [cab] —\nGALLAGHER: (CLEARING THROAT) Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Oh no.\nGALLAGHER: What’s this? Assisting the police with their enquiries?\nMENZIES: Mister Gallagher. What are you doing here?\nGALLAGHER: I’d been hoping to run into your again, my associates had a great deal of trouble tracking you down.\nDOCTOR: What associates?\nDOCTOR: BEFORE BEING JOINED BY SEVERAL MORE.\nGALLAGHER: You know the saying, ‘my enemy’s enemy’? Turns out I’m not alone in wanting you deceased.\nMENZIES: (SOTTO) Doctor, we’ll have to leg it to the car —\nDOCTOR: Patricia, you wouldn’t stand a chance!\nGALLAGHER: No, go ahead. Give it your best shot!\nGALLAGHER: PASSERS-BY.\nMENZIES: What the... Sergeant Patterson, he was in there!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 65\nGALLAGHER: (SARCASTIC) Oh no, the death of a police officer on my conscience.\nTERRAVORE: (BUZZING CLOSER) This is Doctor. Doctor must be eliminated.\nGALLAGHER: Be my guest.\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) Patricia, back into the TARDIS. Now!\nMENZIES: (SOTTO) What about you?\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) I’11 be right behind you! (TO TERRAVORE) Eliminated, you say? Hadn’t you better come a little closer? Just to make sure? (FX: TERRAVORE BUZZES CLOSER STILL) That’s it. Closer. Closer. Aaand — (GRABBING TERRAVORE’S WINGS) — gotcha!\nTERRAVORE: Doctor must — release — wingzzz!\nDOCTOR: (STRUGGLING WITH TERRAVORE) Ohhh no. Goodbye, Mr Gallagher-!\nGALLAGHER: What d’you think you’re playing at-? Doctor-?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 66\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 43: INT. TARDIS CONTROL ROOM\nDOCTOR WHO: TERRAVORE.\nTERRAVORE: Release — wingzzz!\nDOCTOR: Quiet, you-!\nMENZIES: Doctor? What’ve you brought that thing in for-?\nDOCTOR: Just close the doors, Patricia, I can’t hold this thing much longer —\nMENZIES: Yeah, what now-?\nDOCTOR: Now — I need you to press the yellow button third from left on the next panel!\nMENZIES: Yellow button, third from left —\nDOCTOR: Hurry, Patricia!\nMENZIES: Can’t find a yellow button. There’s one that’s sort of ochre —\nDOCTOR: That’s the one!\nDOCTOR: SOOTHING, THROBBING, LIKE A FORCEFIELD. TERRAVORE CALMS.\nMENZIES: It’s not moving. What have you done?\nDOCTOR: Caught it in a sensory disorientation force-field.\nMENZIES: A what?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 67\nDOCTOR: A fly, trapped in amber!

Come on, we haven’t got all day!\nJARED: (STEPPING OUT) What’s going on?\nFLIP: Where are we?\nBREWSTER: Just shut up and do as I say!\nJARED: Oh right, you’re the big man here, are you?\nBREWSTER: Hey, I just shifted an underground train half-way across the galaxy, if that doesn’t deserve some respect I don’t know what does!\nEVELYN: This is your doing, then?\nBREWSTER: Enough questions. Everybody out of the carriage? Good. Now, you see them crates over there? — Pick them up.\nJARED: Why? What’s in them?\nBREWSTER: Machine guns.\nFLIP: Machine guns?\nBREWSTER: Yeah, but don’t get any clever ideas, they’re not loaded. [BEAT] Look, will you lot just get on with it?\nFLIP: Hey, Jared, look at the people in the other carriage — they’re\nFLIP: not moving!\nJARED: Yeah, like they’re frozen.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 69\nEVELYN: Or ina trance.\nBREWSTER: It’s only temporary. I’d take a step back, if I were you!\nBREWSTER: RUSHING, BREAKING-THE-SOUND-BARRIER SOUND. THE SOUND OF THE TRAIN VANISHING. THE PASSENGERS WHO HAVE GOT OFF THE TRAIN MUTTER IN AWE.\nJARED: It’s gone. Vanished!\nFLIP: Into, like, nothing!\nBREWSTER: Yeah, it’s important the interface isn’t left open.\nEVELYN: So I take it we can’t get back?\nBREWSTER: That’s right. And as I’m the only one who knows their way around here, you’d better start doing as you’re told! (ALOUD) Crates! This way! Move!\nBREWSTER: FADE/MUSIC TO:\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 70\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 45: INT. TARDIS CONTROL ROOM\nDOCTOR: Listen to me, my bug-eyed friend. If I were the sort of person to stoop to threats, I’d remind you I can increase the intensity of this force-field. So, for the last time, what are you?\nTERRAVORE: I am Terravore.\nDOCTOR: Terravore?\nMENZIES: You know these things?\nDOCTOR: No. I’ve never met them before, in all my travels.\nTERRAVORE: You are Doctor. Doctor must be eliminated.\nMENZIES: They seem to know you. Are you sure you haven’t forgotten?\nDOCTOR: If I had, I’d hardly know about it, would I? (BEAT) Tell me, how do you know who I am?\nTERRAVORE: Doctor constitutes threat to Terravore objectives.\nDOCTOR: Do you mean I’ve defeated you? Thwarted your plans?\nTERRAVORE: Correct.\nDOCTOR: Well, no wonder you don’t like me!\nMENZIES: I thought you said you’d never — (CATCHING ON) Oh, but this could all be in your future, couldn’t it?\nDOCTOR: You catch on fast. But the problem is, I mustn’t know too much about my own fate -\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 71\nMENZIES: - because it could create some sort of paradox.\nDOCTOR: Well, yes, but mainly because it would spoil all the fun of finding out!\nDOCTOR: FADE/MUSIC TO:\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 72\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 46: EXT. JUNGLE ON THE PLANET SYMBIOS\nDOCTOR WHO: NOISES, APPROACHING A RUSHING RIVER/WATERFALL.\nBREWSTER: Keep moving!\nJARED: What’s the big rush?\nBREWSTER: Because if you don’t, you'll die.\nJARED: Are you threatening us?\nBREWSTER: Not me. We’re not the only ones on this planet, it’s not safe out in the open. Now hurry up!\nFLIP: You alright, Miss?\nEVELYN: Oh, yes. I’ve just had rather a long day, that’s all. And it’s very hot and clammy...\nFLIP: You know this guy, this ‘Doctor’?\nEVELYN: That’s not his name. I don’t know who he is. I’m sorry, I haven’t introduced myself. I’m Evelyn.\nFLIP: Flip. Short for Philippa. This is my boyfriend, Jared.\nJARED: Hi.\nFLIP: We were just heading out to a friend’s party. Didn’t expect to end up.. wherever the hell we are.\nEVELYN: It’s very strange, isn’t it? It seems to be a jungle - but where are all the birds, the insects, the animals?\nJARED: Yeah, well, I’m not exactly desperate to meet the wildlife.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 73\nEVELYN: And the trees — if that’s what they are — don’t they remind you of something?\nFLIP: Now you say, they do look a bit... I don’t know, like bones, or Spare ribs. Kind of fleshy... and wet!\nJARED: And all these roots... they’re more like twisted cables!\nEVELYN: Or veins! The ground too... I’m not entirely sure this is earth we’re treading on - it appears to be pulsating. And that smell. It’s...\nFLIP: Like someone’s been sick?\nEVELYN: I wasn’t going to say it, but yes. Bile! This whole place, it’s like wandering through an anatomy class.\nJARED: So that’s, what, bubbling mud? Or lava, like in Iceland?\nFLIP: It’s blood, isn’t it? Rivers of blood!\nEVELYN: Yes.. I don’t think this is an ordinary alien planet.\nJARED: Oh, visit a lot of alien planets, do you?\nEVELYN: I do, as it happens. But this place... it’s more like one vast living organism!\nEVELYN: FADE/MUSIC TO:\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 74\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 47: INT. TARDIS CONTROL ROOM\nDOCTOR: But why? Why come to Earth to kill me now?\nTERRAVORE: Doctor constitutes threat to Terravore objectives.\nDOCTOR: You mean, your current objectives?\nTERRAVORE: Correct.\nDOCTOR: Which are?\nTERRAVORE: Assimilation of planet. Extraction and exploitation of all chemical resources.\nMENZIES: Yeah, well, think you’1ll find we’ve extracted and exploited most of those ourselves.\nTERRAVORE: We do not assimilate planet Earth. We assimilate planet Symbios. (PRONOUNCED ‘SIM-BEE-OSS’.)\nTERRAVORE: FADE/MUSIC TO:\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 75\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 48: EXT. JUNGLE ON THE PLANET SYMBIOS\nBREWSTER: Come on, nearly there!\nJARED: Uurgh, what is this stuff we’re walking in?\nFLIP: I don’t care, I just want to know whether I’1l ever be able to get it off my shoes.\nJARED: Listen, Doctor whatever-you’re-called, it’s time you gave us some answers. Why’ve you brought us here?\nFLIP: Yeah. And what are all these guns for? My arms are knackered, lugging these crates!\nBREWSTER: If you must ask, the reason you're here, and reason we need\nBREWSTER: all these weapons, is because I’m trying to save this planet!\nEVELYN: Save it? Save it from what?\nBREWSTER: Oh no. I didn’t think they’d made it this far...\nJARED: What are they?\nBREWSTER: Terravore.\nEVELYN: And they’re not friendly.\nBREWSTER: Drop the crates! Use them for cover!\nJARED: Why are they trying to kill us? We haven’t done nothing!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 76\nEVELYN: I suspect it’s guilt by association, isn’t that right?\nBREWSTER: Just stay together, all of you — stay with me!\nJARED: You’ve got to be joking. Run! Everyone! Run!!!\nJARED: GROUND, IT GROANS AND RUMBLES AND JUDDERS.\nEVELYN: The ground... it’s moving.\nJARED: It’s an earthquake!\nBREWSTER: (QUIETLY, TO HIMSELF) At last!\nJARED: C’mon, Flip! What’s stopping you?!? We’ve got to run!\nFLIP: I — I can’t move. My legs. (EFFORT) The mud — it’s sucking, like quicksand.\nJARED: It’s alright, let me [help] — hold on, I’m sinking too!\nFLIP: We're being sucked into the mud!\nEVELYN: Yes. And with those things shooting at us - we’re sitting ducks!\nEVELYN: END OF PART TWO\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 77"

But I get it. ‘Past you’ can’t know about ‘future you’, it’s not that difficult.\nDOCTOR: Well, just in case. If we do meet a young man dressed in Edwardian garb, I’m not the Doctor.

(MOVING OFF)\nMENZIES: Sorry, are you saying that you think you met me before... and\nMENZIES: then forgot about me?\nDOCTOR: (OFF) Do come along, Patricia!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 93\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 59: INT. UNDERGROUND TUNNEL\nDOCTOR: (APPROACHING) This way... yes.. this is all very familiar. I think... I was down here just after the line opened... with —\nMENZIES: With who?\nDOCTOR: With a young chap called [Thomas Brewster —]\nBREWSTER: (SLIGHTLY OFF) What are you doing here?\nDOCTOR: (QUIET) Oh my word. It’s him!\nMENZIES: Who?\nDOCTOR: (QUIET) But what’s he doing here... and why is he dressed in that ridiculous get-up?\nBREWSTER: (MOVING OVER) You shouldn’t be down here, it’s dangerous. Now, I’ll ask you again. What are you doing here?\nDOCTOR: (LOUDER) I’m sorry, we... um... got lost.\nBREWSTER: You don’t expect me to believe that, do you?\nMENZIES: Well, you don’t look like you should be down here either.\nBREWSTER: Lady, that’s none of your business.\nDOCTOR: You’re up to something - something in that tunnel?\nBREWSTER: Okay, that’s it, you’ve seen too much.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 94\nDOCTOR: You’re going to shoot us? How marvellously imaginative!\nBREWSTER: I can’t have you blabbing. You’re going to have to come with me.\nMENZIES: Come with you? Where?\nBREWSTER: My base of operations. Move!\nDOCTOR: (WALKING) Do as the lad says, Patricia...\nBREWSTER: (WALKING) Why are you here, anyhow? You the police?\nMENZIES: (WALKING) Excuse me, do I even look like a policeman?\nBREWSTER: (WALKING) Well then, you must be working for Gallagher. Or another outfit?\nDOCTOR: (WALKING) I don’t have the faintest idea what you’re talking about.\nBREWSTER: Then who are you then? (STOPPING) Answer!\nMENZIES: (STOPPED) Patricia Menzies. And this is my friend...\nDOCTOR: Norman.\nBREWSTER: Norman?\nDOCTOR: Norman Da Plume. But my friends call me Norm. And who are you, might I ask?\nBREWSTER: Me? Well, I suppose I might as well tell you the truth. I’m usually referred to as... the Doctor!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 95\nDOCTOR WHO: Doctor, um...?\nBREWSTER: Just ‘Doctor’. Alright, you two — (FX: HEAVY METAL DOOR CREAKS OPEN.) In here.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 96\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 60: INT. STOREROOM\nMENZIES: (ENTERING, COUGHS AT DUST) What’s in here, besides all the dust?\nBREWSTER: It’s just a store room. Now, I’ve got some business to attend to, so if you’ll excuse me a minute —\nDOCTOR: He’s locked us in. Ha! As if that’s the sort of thing I would do! (BEAT) Should have us out of here ina jiffy!\nMENZIES: So that was the guy who’s been calling himself the Doctor?\nDOCTOR: (CONCENTRATING) Evidently.\nMENZIES: But he’s not the Doctor. He’s not you, I mean.\nDOCTOR: No, he’s the young man I was telling you about. Thomas Brewster.\nMENZIES: So why didn’t he recognise you — (REALISES) Oh, because you’ve got a different face?\nDOCTOR: Precisely. He doesn’t know who I am. And he doesn’t know that I know who he is!\nMENZIES: So who is he then, this Thomas Brewster?\nDOCTOR: I met him about a hundred and fifty years ago. He was running a gang of thieves. He travelled with me for a time. I thought he'd changed his ways, but it seems old habits die hard.\nMENZIES: So he’s some sort of Artful Dodger type?\nDOCTOR: More of an artless dodger, shall we say!\nMENZIES: Well, he seems to have gone up in the world.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 97\nDOCTOR: Yes. I wonder what he’s up to.. and why he’s besmirching my good name into the bargain!\nMENZIES: (DRY) Yes, that was the main thing that was worrying me too.\nDOCTOR: Remind me never to take you on a trip to Literalis Two, Detective-Inspector. On that planet, sarcasm is considered a capital offence!\nMENZIES: But if you already know this ‘Brewster’, why not tell him who you are?\nDOCTOR: Because, my dear Patricia, while he remains unaware of my real identity, we have him at a disadvantage!\nMENZIES: Keep the devastating truth in reserve, you mean.\nDOCTOR: If he had the slightest idea who I was, he’d know that it takes more than a locked door to hold me captive!\nDOCTOR: Please, no need to look impressed.\nMENZIES: I’m not. I’m a police officer. We spend years in training learning that people who can pick locks are the bad guys.\nDOCTOR: Have it your way. (EXITING ROOM) Come on... let’s see what he’s up to.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 98\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 61: INT. BREWSTER’S TIME MACHINE CHAMBER\nDOCTOR WHO: MACHINE FX AS PER ‘THE HAUNTING OF THOMAS BREWSTER’.\nMENZIES: (SOTTO, APPROACHING FROM OFF) What’s that sound? Doctor?\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO, APPROACHING FROM OFF) I strongly suspect, the cause of the temporal breach... (SEEING MACHINE) A-ha!\nMENZIES: (SOTTO) Yeah, it’s a big pile of junk-?\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) Junk?!? Junk?!? It’s something of a botched job, I admit, but that makes it all the more impressive!\nMENZIES: (SOTTO) Aw, c’mon. You’re not seriously telling me that’s —\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) - a time machine, yes. Brewster built it, back when I first met him. I thought it had been destroyed.\nMENZIES: (SOTTO) Doesn’t look very destroyed to me.\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) Come along, I want to take a closer look — (MAKING TO MOVE)\nMENZIES: (URGENT) Hold up, Doctor-!\nDOCTOR: (HISSED) What is it now-?\nMENZIES: (SOTTO) We’re not alone.\nBREWSTER: (OFF) .. Alright, first job is to align the light beams. Mind you don’t burn yourselves, yeah?\nBREWSTER: FIZZES AND CHANGES IN PITCH.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 99\nMENZIES: (SOTTO) What’s up with the other two? They look all — zombified.\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) They’re operating the machine. But to what end, I wonder-?\nMENZIES: (SOTTO) Wait a minute — I know that face. That’s Tricia Welsh.\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) Who?\nMENZIES: (SOTTO) One of the people reported missing. And the other one, that’s Danny Coles, I think... [But what’s he want with them? What’s he —]\nBREWSTER: (OFF) Yeah, nicely done. (ALOUD) Alright — you can come out now.\nMENZIES: (SOTTO) .. up... to?\nBREWSTER: Oh, you heard. Stand up, will you?\nDOCTOR: (STANDING) Ah. Rumbled.\nBREWSTER: (STEPPING FORWARD TO MEET THEM) I see you’ve discovered my little science project.\nDOCTOR: What is it? No wait, let me guess — you’re trying to perfect a microwave chip that really does taste as good as the fried variety?\nBREWSTER: Don’t play games. I know who you are.\nDOCTOR: You do?\nBREWSTER: I’ve been expecting you, ever since I ran into your ‘companion’, Evelyn.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 100\nDOCTOR: Evelyn? Doesn’t ring any bells, I’m afraid.\nBREWSTER: That’s why I locked you up. A test. I knew that if you were who I thought you are, you’d escape. And here you are!\nDOCTOR: No, I just gave the door a nudge and it swung open, I think you may have forgotten to lock it —\nBREWSTER: ‘Norman Da Plume’. What kind of idiot do you take me for, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Doctor? ‘Doctor’?\nBREWSTER: Don’t deny it. I know you can change what you look like.\nDOCTOR: I believe you may be mistaken —\nBREWSTER: No mistake. Your ‘TARDIS’ is in the tunnel upstairs.\nDOCTOR: Alright, I suppose I should come clean. [I’m —]\nMENZIES: (STEPPING FORWARD) Yeah, you’re right kid. I’m the Doctor.\nBREWSTER: What?\nMENZIES: I’m the Doctor. The traveller in Time and Space. It’s me.\nBREWSTER: You?\nMENZIES: And Norman — Norm — here. Is my assistant.\nDOCTOR: (INCREDULOUS) I am?\nMENZIES: He, uh, hates it when I call him that. (TO DOCTOR) Alright, then — ‘companion’.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 101\nBREWSTER: But you’re.. you're...\nMENZIES: What?\nBREWSTER: A woman!\nMENZIES: I thought you said you knew I could change my appearance.\nBREWSTER: Yeah, but.. only up to a point!\nMENZIES: You're surprised? You should have been there when it happened! Poor old Norm didn’t know where to look!\nBREWSTER: You mean, you used to be a male Doctor, and now you’re —\nMENZIES: - wearing court shoes, yes. Must admit, it took some time getting used to —\nDOCTOR: You can say that again!\nBREWSTER: You’re really the Doctor?\nMENZIES: Oh, yes.\nBREWSTER: Well, in that case — I need your help.\nBREWSTER: FADE/MUSIC TO:\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 102\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 62: INT. TUBE PLATFORM\nANNOUNCER: The next train is for all stations to Aldgate. All stations to Aldgate.\nANNOUNCER: BREWSTER, MENZIES AND THE DOCTOR ARE WALKING ALONG THE PLATFORM, SPEAKING LOUDLY TO BE HEARD OVER THE NOISE OF INCOMING TRAIN.\nBREWSTER: It started about six months ago, when the Locus first made contact. They were asking after you. Said the Doctor had sorted them out before, and they needed his help.\nMENZIES: So you decided to assist this ‘Locus’ by providing weapons and human bodies?\nBREWSTER: Hey, it was the best I could come up with.\nDOCTOR: And how have you been delivering your ‘volunteers’? To pass through a temporal breach would need some form of transport...\nDOCTOR: BLIND.\nBREWSTER: How do you think?\nMENZIES: Sorry, you sent them to an alien planet... by tube?\nBREWSTER: Get in.\nBREWSTER: FADE/MUSIC TO:\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 103\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 63: EXT. JUNGLE ON THE PLANET SYMBIOS\nDOCTOR WHO: ARRIVAL OF TUBE TRAIN, AS BEFORE. BEAT. DOORS WHOOSH OPEN.\nBREWSTER: (GETTING OUT) And here we are. The planet Symbios.\nDOCTOR: Extraordinary.. An entire tube train shifted through a space- time wormhole!\nBREWSTER: (TO MENZIES) Had a lot of experience of this sort of thing, your ‘companion’?\nMENZIES: I’m, uh, training him up. He’s doing alright, most of the time.\nDOCTOR: Can’t say I’m overwhelmed by Symbios - except by the smell.\nBREWSTER: (TO MENZIES) If you could tell ‘Norman’ to step this way, Doctor — the interface is only open for about a minute —\nMENZIES: I get it. You don’t want the, uhhhhh —\nDOCTOR: (VERY SOTTO) — Terravore —\nMENZIES: . Terravore to discover your short-cut?\nBREWSTER: Exactly. If they ever found the interface and used it to travel to Earth... it doesn’t bear thinking about.\nDOCTOR: I can understand you wanting to help this ‘Locus’, Thomas — your intentions are admirable, even if your methods are not... but why pretend to be the Doctor-?\nMENZIES: Yeah, why pretend to be me?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 104\nBREWSTER: Because the Doctor was who the Locus wanted. If they knew who I really was they wouldn’t have trusted me, would they — (TRAILS OFF) Norm, mate? Why are you looking at me like that?\nDOCTOR: Me? I’m not looking at you like anything. —\nBREWSTER: Good. —\nDOCTOR: I’m looking at the people behind you.\nBREWSTER: (TURNING) Oh, what-?\nBREWSTER: ALL HAVE BEEN POSSESSED BY THE LOCUS. MAYBE VOICE EFFECT.\nFLIP: (STEPPING FORWARD) We know the truth.\nJARED: (STEPPING FORWARD) We know you are not the Doctor.\nEVELYN: (STEPPING FORWARD) The woman Smythe told us everything, before we occupied her form.\nDOCTOR: You did what?\nEVELYN: We are Locus. The voice of this planet.\nMENZIES: Sorry, repeat?\nEVELYN: We are the Locus. And we have been betrayed. Take him!\nBREWSTER: What? What, no? You have to listen to me! Alright, so I’m not\nBREWSTER: the Doctor, but I brought you bodies, didn’t I?\nDOCTOR: Let him go!\nFLIP: What?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 105\nDOCTOR: You asked for the Doctor. Well, now you have the genuine article.\nJARED: The genuine article?\nMENZIES: Me. It’s me. I’m the Doctor.\nEVELYN: Then... prove it.\nEVELYN: FADE/MUSIC TO:\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 106\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 64: EXT. JUNGLE ON THE PLANET SYMBIOS\nDOCTOR WHO: MUD.\nMENZIES: (SOTTO) What was I supposed to say? I can’t prove I’m the Doctor!\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) Don’t worry. If this ‘Locus’ isn’t prepared to believe you.. then that’s their problem.\nBREWSTER: (SOTTO) Really? That’s it, that’s the best you can do?\nMENZIES: (SOTTO) Oh, because your plan was working so well, you mean?\nBREWSTER: (SOTTO) Hey, I make a more convincing Doctor than you!\nMENZIES: (SOTTO) Yeah, you can take the boy out of the Victorian age, but...\nDOCTOR: (STRIDING FORWARD) Er — Locus. Tell me about yourself, I’ve never addressed a living planet before.\nEVELYN: Who are you to ask?\nDOCTOR: Oh, no-one, just the Doctor’s companion, it’s kind of my job to ask stupid questions.\nEVELYN: We are the Locus. We are all around you.\nFLIP: In every organism, in every cell.\nJARED: The ground beneath your feet, the air you breathe.\nDOCTOR: Interesting, but that doesn’t really explain much. Wait... Symbios. A planet of symbiosis! Different organisms acting together as one...\nEVELYN: All life on Symbios exists in harmony.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 107\nDOCTOR: Yes. One organism. But that should be an evolutionary dead- end... except one part of you kept on developing, didn’t it? The\nDOCTOR: genetic inheritance!\nFLIP: You comprehend our true nature?\nDOCTOR: I’m beginning to. The genes themselves evolved their own independent intelligence! Like.. oh, I don’t know, computer viruses! Ghosts in the biological machine!\nMENZIES: Norman — look!\nDOCTOR: Who? Oh, you mean me — Oh no, it seems our presence has been noted.\nBREWSTER: The Terravore.\nEVELYN: Remain where you are. You will be absorbed by Symbios.\nMENZIES: What?\nFLIP: You shall be conveyed beneath the surface.\nBREWSTER: It’s alright, I’ve done it a hundred times. Just - hold still.\nDOCTOR: Well, if you’re sure —\nTERRAVORE: Detect trace of Doctor! Detect trace of Doctor!\nTERRAVORE: UNDER THE SURFACE. LEAVING THE SOUND OF BUBBLING MUD.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 108\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 65: INT. UNDERGROUND TUNNEL ON SYMBIOS.\nDOCTOR WHO: ALL EMERGE FROM MUD.\nMENZIES: That... was disgusting.\nBREWSTER: Don’t worry, it’ll slide off in a minute. It’s bile, mostly.\nMENZIES: Bile?!?\nEVELYN: The Terravore.. they identified you as the Doctor.\nMENZIES: What? Oh, yes, I suppose they did.\nDOCTOR: So now you know you can trust us. Your enemy’s enemy!\nFLIP: The Doctor visited Symbios many years ago —\nJARED: - and saved us from the [Drahvin menace —]\nDOCTOR: (LOUD) Lalalalala! Lalalalala!\nMENZIES: What are you doing, ‘Norman’?\nDOCTOR: Locus, I’m afraid as far as the Doctor here is concerned, that particular encounter has yet to take place.. So if you could keep the details to yourself, it would be much appreciated!\nEVELYN: We understand. (TO MENZIES) So, will you assist us?\nMENZIES: L<—\nDOCTOR: The Doctor has three conditions.\nJARED: Doesn’t the Doctor speak for herself?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 109\nMENZIES: No, it’s okay, I’m training him. Work experience. Go on, Norm.\nDOCTOR: Condition one. You return the minds of all the people you have kidnapped. I’1l talk to them, I’m sure they’1ll agree to help of their own accord.\nEVELYN: We shall do this. Save for this form.\nDOCTOR: What? No, no exceptions.\nEVELYN: For communication purposes only. When the Terravore are defeated, her mind shall also be returned.\nDOCTOR: (CONSIDERS) Very well.\nFLIP: Your second condition?\nDOCTOR: All the humans must be returned safely to Earth.\nJARED: Agreed. And your third?\nDOCTOR: My third condition is that you listen carefully, and do exactly as I say...\nDOCTOR: FADE/MUSIC TO:\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 110\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 66: EXT. JUNGLE ON THE PLANET SYMBIOS\nMENZIES: I still don’t see why Symbios couldn’t have brought us here.\nDOCTOR: Have you ever travelled intravenously? It’s not pleasant.\nBREWSTER: (JOINING THEM) Right. The Terravore hive-ship’s about half a mile away.\nMENZIES: Only half a mile? What a pity, this was turning into a nice ramble. The country air, the sound of birdsong...\nDOCTOR: And the Terravore?\nBREWSTER: They’re swarming all around the ship. There’s no way we can get inside with them seeing us.\nDOCTOR: Then let’s hope the others are ready with the diversion!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 111\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 67: EXT. JUNGLE ON THE PLANET SYMBIOS\nDOCTOR WHO: OF A CLUMN OF ARMED HUMANOIDS — CLANKING MACHINE GUNS.\nJARED: This is so mad, Flip - a few hours ago we were on our way to Marty’s twenty-first, now we’re on an alien planet getting ready to zap alien invaders with machine guns!\nFLIP: Not as mad as you volunteering for it!\nJARED: Come on, this is brilliant. This is better than Call Of Duty or Avatar. This is seriously hardcore!\nFLIP: (STOPPING) And when we get killed?\nEVELYN: You shall not come to any harm.\nFLIP: Forgive me for not having total faith in a living planet that talks through the body of an OA P!\nJARED: All we have to do is get their attention. Ready, Flip?\nFLIP: No, not remotely, but don’t wait on my behalf.\nJARED: (ALOUD) And the rest of you, Clarkey, Sunetra, Ellie, Mrs Lewis?\nJARED: Okay, let’s go. Lock and load!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 112\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 68: EXT. JUNGLE ON THE PLANET SYMBIOS\nDOCTOR WHO: TERRAVORE. MASSED TERRAVORE BUZZING.\nTERRAVORE: (DISTANT) Terravore under attack! Terravore under attack!\nBREWSTER: It’s working, those things are going after my gang.\nDOCTOR: They’re not your gang any more, Thomas.\nBREWSTER: Hey, this is exactly how things would’ve worked out if I was still in charge!\nMENZIES: Could you two stop bickering for one moment? They’re leaving the hive-ship... come on!\nMENZIES: TERRAVORE BUZZING AND BLASTING.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 113\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 69: DELETED SCENE 70: INT. TERRAVORE HIVE-SHIP\nMENZIES: Okay, we’re inside the ship, now what?\nBREWSTER: Er, you’re the Doctor, aren’t you the one with the plan?\nDOCTOR: What the Doctor meant to say was that we need to find the source of the control transmission.\nMENZIES: That was what I meant to say. Sorry, my mind was on higher things.\nDOCTOR: The transmission must be coming from somewhere in this ship.\nMENZIES: Like, er, radio control.\nBREWSTER: Oh, right.\nDOCTOR: This way, I think, towards the centre?\nMENZIES: If you say so, Norm, but I don’t want you getting into [trouble -]\nBREWSTER: Oh my life! Doctor!!!\nDOCTOR: Stay back, Brewster! There’s nothing you can do!\nDOCTOR: TERRAVORE GLIDES INTO THE CHAMBER.\nBREWSTER: What the hell is that?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 114\nDOCTOR: I’m guessing — the Terravore Queen!\nBREWSTER: She’s massive!\nBREWSTER: ELECTRONIC VOICE LIKE THE OTHER TERRAVORE BUT DEEPER, MORE IMPOSING.\nTERRAVORE QUEEN: Do not approach the female organic.\nBREWSTER: (WHISPER) Norman, the control signal!\nDOCTOR: We’ve found it, Thomas. Don’t you see? The Terravore Queen is the control signal.\nBREWSTER: What? But then, then — the Doctor’s plan has failed. These things have won. Everyone on this planet, they’re all gonna die!\nBREWSTER: END OF PART THREE\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 115"

Think about it! Symbios is unique in the universe. Peaceful. Intelligent. Whereas Earth is a polluted world, its natural resources almost exhausted, presided over by a race that has nothing better to do than wage war on its own species!\nMENZIES: But the Earth... six billion people will die!\nDOCTOR: The Locus was right.

Put your weapon down now.\nBREWSTER: Well, where have you been hiding?!?\nEVELYN: We anticipated this situation.

Is Symbios safe?\nEVELYN: Only the Queen and her personal drones remain.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 137\nDOCTOR: Good. Then I think it’s time we left. I’ve locked off the controls to the time machine so that only I can close the wormhole.

These things are going to over-run the planet.

It’s still open, remember?\nMENZIES: Well, you’re welcome to try. But cheesy as it may sound, if I’m going to die, I’d like it to be on the planet Earth.\nJARED: Thomas, what about you?\nBREWSTER: No, you go.

(THEY EXIT)\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 140\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 88: EXT. JUNGLE ON THE PLANET SYMBIOS\nDOCTOR WHO: HEAR TERRAVORES BUZZING BY AND THE TEMPORAL PORTAL.\nEVELYN: Why have you brought us back to the wormhole?\nDOCTOR: Seemed as good a place as any. Give us a chance to watch the last of the Terravore depart! Only a couple more and the Terravore Queen to go. Typical royalty, can’t go anywhere until they’ve rolled out the red carpet! (BEAT) Excuse me, would you mind if I made a quick phone call?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 141\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 89: INT. BREWSTER’S TIME MACHINE CHAMBER\nBREWSTER: I think that’s you, isn’t it?\nMENZIES: Caller ID with-held. (ANSWERING PHONE) Menzies.\nDOCTOR: (VIA PHONE) Hello. It’s me!\nMENZIES: (INCREDULOUS) You have a mobile?\nDOCTOR: (VIA PHONE)\nDOCTOR: I do. Or rather, our young friend Jared doesn’t. I’m sure he won’t mind. I realised your mobile signal was being carried through the wormhole along with the Terravore Queen’s control Signal. That’s how she’s been contacting the Terravore on Earth.\nMENZIES: And you called to tell me that?\nDOCTOR: No, I called to ask you to do something vitally important for\nDOCTOR: the safety of the human race.\nMENZIES: All right, what?\nDOCTOR: (VIA PHONE) Could you hand me over to Thomas, please?\nMENZIES: It’s for you.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 142\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 90: EXT. JUNGLE ON THE PLANET SYMBIOS\nBREWSTER: (VIA PHONE) Hello?\nDOCTOR: Thomas! I do hope you haven’t been attempting to unlock the controls of your time-machine!\nBREWSTER: (VIA PHONE) Why? What’s it to you?\nDOCTOR: Well, even if you have, it doesn’t matter. I need you to do something for me.\nBREWSTER: (VIA PHONE) Why should I?\nDOCTOR: Because it will save your life, and the lives of everyone on Earth. Do you trust me?\nBREWSTER: (VIA PHONE) No.\nDOCTOR: Good, because I’ve been lying to you.\nBREWSTER: (VIA PHONE) What?\nDOCTOR: If you do as I say, you’1ll be able to shut down the time machine and close the temporal breach.\nBREWSTER: (VIA PHONE) I don’t believe you.\nDOCTOR: I’m not asking you to believe me, I’m just asking you to do as I say. Think about it — what do you have to lose?\nBREWSTER: (VIA PHONE) Okay, what do I have to do —\nEVELYN: That’s enough. End the call, Norman. Or you will die.\nDOCTOR: Oh, Locus, Locus! You’ve making a massive mistake...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 143\nEVELYN: No mistake.\nDOCTOR: The body you are currently inhabiting belongs to my good friend Evelyn. And while you may be able to control her words, you will never make her pull that trigger.\nEVELYN: And why not?\nDOCTOR: Because I am the Doctor.\nEVELYN: You are the Doctor?\nDOCTOR: The real thing! Accept no substitutes!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 144\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 91: INT. BREWSTER’S TIME MACHINE CHAMBER\nBREWSTER: (INTO PHONE) Doctor? Are you there? Doctor!!!\nDOCTOR: (VIA PHONE)\nDOCTOR: . Sorry about that, a little local difficulty. Now, Brewster, we have to time this very carefully. On my word, and not before, raise the third lever to its highest setting.\nBREWSTER: Now?\nDOCTOR: (VIA PHONE) Not yet, we have to wait for the last of the Terravore drones to enter the interface... now, Brewster! Now!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 145\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 92: INT. UNDERGROUND TUNNEL\nJARED: We can do it, Flip. We’re nearly at the wormhole —\nFLIP: . and there’s a Terravore coming out of it!\nTERRAVORE: Organics detected. Organics detected!\nTERRAVORE: VANISHING SOUND WE HEARD BACK IN PART TWO.\nJARED: Oh no. Oh no, no! The wormhole is closing!\nTERRAVORE: Organics must be eliminated!\nFLIP: Run, Jared! (TO TERRAVORE) Take me, not him!\nJARED: Flip, you can’t-!\nFLIP: (WEEPY) Please, Jared! Run!!!\nFLIP: BEGINS TO DROP IN PITCH.\nTERRAVORE: Connection broken! Restore contact! Connection broken!\nJARED: It’s dead. It’s dead!\nFLIP: Luckily for us. I thought we’d had it!\nJARED: Yeah... but if this fella’s out of action... then maybe all the other ones are too?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 146\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 93: EXT. JUNGLE ON THE PLANET SYMBIOS\nDOCTOR: Well done, Brewster. Well done!\nEVELYN: What’s happened?\nDOCTOR: My friend has sealed off the temporal breach.\nEVELYN: But the Terravore Queen... she is still here.\nDOCTOR: And she alone.\nTERRAVORE QUEEN: (BUZZING UP, IN MUCH DISCOMFORT, WHIRRING AND CLANKING AND VOICE WOBBLING IN PITCH.) I have lost contact with the swarm. Connection broken! Restore contact! Connection broken!\nDOCTOR: You might as well stop trying, Your Majesty. You’re out of range.\nEVELYN: Doctor, why is she affected?\nDOCTOR: Because, Locus, the Terravore are a hive mind, a gestalt. Rather like your good self, they have no independent existence. I guessed as much from the fact that the Terravore Queen would be the last to travel to Earth. She could not risk losing contact with the swarm.\nEVELYN: Because without them —\nDOCTOR: Because without them, she can’t survive. Just as they can’t survive without her. The fewer of them there are, the weaker she gets — and with none of them left...\nTERRAVORE QUEEN: (POWER IS AUDIBLY FADING) You will be eliminated for this, Doctor. Eliminated!\nDOCTOR: You don’t have enough power, Your Majesty. But before you go into standby mode, I have one question. Why?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 147\nTERRAVORE QUEEN: Why?\nDOCTOR: Why roam the galaxy, accumulating the resources of every planet that gets in your way? What’s it all for?\nTERRAVORE QUEEN: Terravore directive. We are to extract and assimilate all mineral wealth. On behalf of those who constructed us.\nDOCTOR: Terraforming robots running amok! No doubt the product of a civilisation destroyed by their own creations when they forgot to include an off switch! All that death, all that destruction... and all for nothing!\nTERRAVORE QUEEN: (ALMOST INCOHERENT) This is not our first encounter...\nDOCTOR: I know. And I’m rather looking forward to it.\nEVELYN: Doctor. We always knew you would come to our assistance.\nDOCTOR: Well, let me warn you, ‘Locus’. Don’t ever come asking for my help again, because I won’t be there for you a third time. Now, give me Evelyn back!\nDOCTOR: EVELYN RETURNS TO HER OLD SELF, A LITTLE SHAKEN.\nEVELYN: Doctor-?!?\nDOCTOR: Evelyn. You’re safe, don’t worry.\nEVELYN: What happened? There was this young man pretending to be you... and I was in this cave -\nDOCTOR: It’s a long story. I’1ll explain later.\nEVELYN: Oh, must you? I think I’d rather remain in blissful ignorance, just this once...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 148\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 94: EXT. LONDON STREET\nNEWSPAPER VENDOR: (IN B/G) Latest news on the Japanese toy robot terror! (REPEATS)\nMENZIES: (WALKING UP) Here we go, Doctor, Miss Smythe. One Police Box.\nEVELYN: (FX: PATTING TARDIS) Good old TARDIS. (TO MENZIES) We’re free to go, then, Detective-Inspector?\nMENZIES: The sooner the better, if you don’t mind.\nDOCTOR: Of course. This is goodbye, then, Patricia —\nMENZIES: Doctor. There’s one thing I don’t understand.\nEVELYN: One thing? Only one thing? You understand everything else?\nMENZIES: What was the point of the whole ‘pretending to sacrifice Earth’ routine?\nDOCTOR: Ah. You see, I knew my words were being overhead by the Locus — and I had to convince them that I wasn’t up to something. The best way to that — was to seem to betray my friends!\nMENZIES: Remind me never to trust you.\nDOCTOR: Very wise. Because if there is one thing you can be sure of, it’s that there’s more to me than meets the eye!\nEVELYN: Patricia, you wouldn’t know what happened to Jared, and Philippa —\nMENZIES: Currently at the station for debriefing, and then, well, the non-stop excitement of adjusting back to normal life. I imagine I'll see them in my group therapy sessions.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 149\nDOCTOR: And the members of Brewster’s gang?\nMENZIES: We've had reports of people turning up after days, suffering from amnesia. Seems they found their way home in the end. Brewster himself, no sign.\nDOCTOR: Yes. If I know Thomas Brewster, he’s not going to let himself get caught that easily.\nMENZIES: You may be right. Anyway, I’ve got more than enough on my plate, tidying up after his mess. But thank you, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: No, thank you, Detective Inspector.\nMENZIES: Thank me? For what?\nDOCTOR: For not letting on that we had already met. Most considerate of you.\nMENZIES: You knew? All along?\nDOCTOR: An educated guess. And when we meet again — I’1l do my best to return the favour!\nMENZIES: Goodbye, Doctor. See you later. (SHE WALKS)\nDOCTOR: (CALLING AFTER) Goodbye, Patricia. See you earlier! (BEAT) So, where to now, Evelyn? I think, after all this, we deserve a well-earned —\nEVELYN: Please, don’t say ‘rest’.\nDOCTOR: What?\nEVELYN: Whenever you say you’re going to land us somewhere nice, it always ends badly.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 150\nDOCTOR: It does not. Oh ye of little faith! (FX: PATTING POCKETS) Hello, I seem to have misplaced the TARDIS key.\nEVELYN: (FX: PUSHING TARDIS DOOR OPEN) Then it’s just as well you left the door open, isn’t it?\nDOCTOR: Left the door open-? Me?!?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE GATHERING SWARM by Jonathan Morris (005) Page 151\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 95: INT. TARDIS CONTROL ROOM\nEVELYN: (WALKING IN) Take it from me, Doctor, that’s how it starts. Leaving the door open, leaving the gas on —\nDOCTOR: Are you saying, I’m getting old?!?\nBREWSTER: (OFF) Naah, you didn’t leave the door open. But I did nab the key.\nDOCTOR: Brewster! I might have known! Once a cutpurse, always a\nDOCTOR: cutpurse!\nEVELYN: What are you doing here? Thomas?\nBREWSTER: Guess.\nDOCTOR: Oh, please. Put the gun down, Brewster.\nBREWSTER: You don’t get it, do you? This is a hi-jack.\nEVELYN: A hi-jack?\nBREWSTER: You’re gonna take me back to my own time. Now!\nDOCTOR: Excuse me, but I do not take orders from any common thief!\nBREWSTER: No more talk, Doctor. Drive!\nBREWSTER: THE END"
