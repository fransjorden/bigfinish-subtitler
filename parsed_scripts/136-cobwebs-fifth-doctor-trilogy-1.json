But you have to understand, when he agreed to act on the Black Guardian’s behalf, he didn’t know what he was getting himself into!\nTEGAN: Yeah, right! He agreed to work for a bloke with a dead crow on his head! Nothing suspicious there!\nDOCTOR: It might also be worth bearing in mind that when he entered into the contract, it was before he’d met any of us.\nTEGAN: That’s no excuse! If anything, that’s worse! He was prepared to murder somebody he didn’t even know!\nDOCTOR: But the point is, he didn’t. He had the opportunity, time and time again, but did nothing. Doesn’t that tell you something?\nTEGAN: Yes — it tells me he’s incompetent! The only reason you’re not floating through space with a big hole in your head is because whenever he tried to bump you off, he messed it up!\nDOCTOR: But in the end he chose not to! Remember, he tried to end his own life, simply to be free of the Black Guardian’s influence.\nTEGAN: You’re not the one who spent half a day stuck in a ventilation shaft with him! He creeps me out.\nDOCTOR: Anybody can make a mistake, Tegan.\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 3\nTEGAN: And you made a mistake by letting him onboard!

So long as I have you to look after me.\nLOKI: That’s all very well, but who’s going to look after me?\nNYSSA: You can multi-task, can’t you? Commencing descent. Hold tight, Loki.

What’s it like?\nTURLOUGH: Well, it’s not exactly where I come from.\nTEGAN: But it’s where your family are, right?\nTURLOUGH: Not quite.\nTEGAN: Turlough, what are you up to?\nTURLOUGH: It’s complicated.

I’d feel happier if there were some lights on in here.\nNYSSA: Just watch where you’re treading.\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 8\nLOKI: How can I watch where I’m treading when you have the torch?\nNYSSA: There should be a schematic in the entrance, all these stations have the same layout.\nLOKI: Ow!\nNYSSA: I said to watch out.\nLOKI: You said I should watch where I was treading. You never said anything about minding my head!\nNYSSA: Here it is. (READS) Control room, laboratory, crew quarters... Back-up generators!\nLOKI: What’re you’re looking for?\nNYSSA: A way to get the lights back on. The generator stacks are four levels down, and the elevator won’t be functioning, so we’1ll have to use the access shaft. Loki? (LOUDER) Loki!\nLOKI: The schematic.. could you shine the light over here again?\nNYSSA: What is it?\nLOKI: Six levels down. ‘Unidentified subterranean ruins’.\nNYSSA: Interesting. We shall have to take a look.\nLOKI: Must we?\nNYSSA: After I’ve got the lights back on. First things first...\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 9\nLOKI: Aaargh!\nNYSSA: What is it this time?\nLOKI: I stepped on something, I stepped on something!\nNYSSA: Hold still, wait until I can see what I’m doing... don’t worry. It’s just some cobwebs.\nLOKI: Cobwebs?\nNYSSA: Yes. There... they’re everywhere. This whole section of the airlock’s outer wall...\nLOKI: You know what cobwebs mean.\nNYSSA: What? What do cobwebs mean?\nLOKI: Spiders.\nNYSSA: I thought you said there were no life signs... wait. There you are. Your ‘spider’.\nLOKI: A robot maintenance spider! Oh, thank the goodness of Freya!\nNYSSA: It’s deactivated. It must have run out of energy.\nLOKI: Excuse me, that landed on my foot.\nNYSSA: Here we are. ‘Access shaft’.

Some kind of disturbance has dragged the TARDIS off-course.. and is pulling us down in a temporal spiral!\nTEGAN: Down? Down to where?\nDOCTOR: Not sure. It’s as if something is trying to force us to materialize...\nTURLOUGH: Can’t you increase the power so the TARDIS can break free?\nDOCTOR: That’s what I’m trying to do. Trouble is, it’s rather difficult to increase the power when it’s already on ‘maximum’ !\nTEGAN: Do you think it could be a Black Guardian trap?\nDOCTOR: (SARCASTIC) Yes, Tegan, causing us to crash-land on a distant planet is exactly the sort of thing that might lull us into a false sense of security.\nTEGAN: (MUTTERS) Could be a double-bluff.\nTURLOUGH: How long can the TARDIS withstand it?\nDOCTOR: Not indefinitely. No choice! I’m going to have to perform a materialisation flip-flop. Hold tight!\nTEGAN: You know, you really should fit this thing with safety belts!\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 11\nDOCTOR WHO: 6. SOLAR GENERATORS\nNYSSA: Hurry up, Loki. You’re supposed to be my guardian...!\nLOKI: I’m doing the best I can. I wasn’t built for vertical descent. And I’ve got cobwebs stuck to my ocular feed.\nNYSSA: Here. Is that better?\nLOKI: A little. (BEAT) So these are the power generators?\nNYSSA: Yes. Hold the torch for me, could you?\nNYSSA: Just as I thought!\nLOKI: What is it?\nNYSSA: While the main solar stack has been exhausted, the back-up has enough power to keep the lights on for a day or so.\nLOKI: Oh. That’s good news.\nNYSSA: All I have to do is switch to secondary input, and...\nLOKI: Ah! Can see where we are now.\nNYSSA: We should be able to access the neuronic logs as they come back online. Find out precisely what the crew were working on before they died...\nLOKI: You’re sure that’s a good idea?\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 12\nNYSSA: We can hardly return [empty-handed] — What was that?\nLOKI: What was what?\nNYSSA: I thought I saw something move. Near the access shaft. Scan for life-signs!\nLOKI: Scanning...\nLOKI: (FX: QUIETLY AT FIRST, WE HEAR THE SQUEAL OF THE CRACTIDS. A MIXTURE OF SCUTTLING FEET, SNAPPING CLAWS AND EXCITED HUNGRY\nRAT: CHITTERS. AS TERRIFYING AS POSSIBLE. )\nNYSSA: There... some sort of crustacean, with an exoskeleton, two claws, eight, no, six legs, and mandibles, like a scorpion!\nLOKI: I’m not detecting any signs of life.\nNYSSA: But you must... There are two of them... three.. — Loki, neutralise them! (BEAT) You’re meant to protect me!\nLOKI: I’m sorry, Miss Nyssa, but according to my sensors there’s nothing there... No heat, no electromagnetic radiation —\nNYSSA: You can’t see them?\nLOKI: No.\nNYSSA: But they’re on my legs... (OW!) Get them off me! (SCREAMS) Help me! Help!\nNYSSA: (FX: THE CRACTIDS ARE EVERYWHERE. THE LISTENER SHOULD FEEL AS\nTHOUGH: THEIR HEAD IS STUCK IN A BUCKETFUL OF LOBSTERS).\nLOKI: I’m sorry, but I am unable to perceive any threat.\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 13\nDOCTOR WHO: 7. CONSOLE ROOM\nDOCTOR WHO: DOCTOR, TEGAN AND TURLOUGH\nDOCTOR: There. That wasn’t so bad, was it?\nTEGAN: I feel like my stomach and my heart have swapped places.\nDOCTOR: Really? Then I’d avoid eating for half an hour. Now let’s see where we are...\nTEGAN: Oh great, another gloomy corridor.\nTURLOUGH: Where are we?\nDOCTOR: As far as I can tell, the eastern edge of the galaxy. Far out in the uncharted backwaters.\nTEGAN: In a corridor.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Sterile atmosphere, gravity normal... Let’s take a look outside, shall we?\nTEGAN: Are you sure that’s such a clever idea?\nTURLOUGH: Tegan’s right, Doctor. If something brought us here —\nDOCTOR: - then I would rather like to find out why.\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 14\nDOCTOR WHO: 8. BASE CORRIDOR\nTEGAN: Ugh! This place looks like it’s seen better days.\nDOCTOR: Mmm? Oh, the cobwebs. Yes. Odd that.\nTURLOUGH: Odd?\nDOCTOR: No smell of decay, no build-up of dust.\nTEGAN: So what’s with all the cobwebs then? Cleaners on strike?\nDOCTOR: Whatever you do, Tegan, don’t move. Stay perfectly still, look down slowly and try not to scream.\nTEGAN: Scream? You [patronising —] (WINCES) What is it?\nTURLOUGH: A maintenance spider.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Rather endearing, isn’t it? It must be responsible for all the cobwebs.\nTEGAN: What for? To catch robot flies?\nDOCTOR: No. Some sort of protective sealant... yes, look. (BLOWS DUST) See where the insulation has burned through? Neat system.\nTURLOUGH: So the robot coats the damage, before beginning its repairs?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Even down to a micromolecular level, I should imagine.\nTEGAN: Is it dangerous?\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 15\nDOCTOR: Completely harmless. This one must be running low on juice, to leave a job half-finished. (BEAT) Ah! Crew quarters!\nDOCTOR: Hello? Anyone at home?\nTEGAN: If there is, they should take a look at their thermostat. (SHIVERS) It’s like walking around in a freezer in here.\nDOCTOR: Tegan, your capacity to complain never ceases to astound me.\nTEGAN: Hey, if you ever landed us somewhere half-way decent you wouldn’t hear a peep out of me.\nTEGAN: Turlough, has no-one ever told you that’s it’s not polite to rummage around in other people’s property?\nTURLOUGH: First aid equipment, disinfectant, laboratory clothes — it seems somebody left in a hurry!\nDOCTOR: Yes. If they did leave. Strangely spartan, don’t you think?\nTEGAN: Spartan? Oh. No framed photographs. No bedside reading.\nDOCTOR: Exactly. No personal effects at all. Anonymous.\nTEGAN: And there’s no windows either. It must be like living ina submarine.\nTEGAN: What was that?\nDOCTOR: Shhh.\nTURLOUGH: We’re not alone.\nDOCTOR: No.. — no, it doesn’t sound like we are!\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 16\nDOCTOR WHO: 9. SOLAR GENERATORS\nDOCTOR: It seemed to come from down here. Come on!\nTEGAN: (WHISPERS) What’s this? The engine room?\nTURLOUGH: Yes. Solar stack generators. Primitive, but effective.\nDOCTOR: (CALLS OUT) Hello! We don’t mean you any harm.\nTEGAN: When has saying that ever worked?\nDOCTOR: You don’t have to hide, you know...\nLOKI: Warning! Threat-mode activated. You will remain motionless. Any unanticipated movement will be considered an act of aggression.\nTEGAN: Good grief, what is it?\nTURLOUGH: It doesn’t appear to be armed.\nLOKI: I am equipped with numerous defence mechanisms. Do not move\nLOKI: any closer. This is your final warning!\nDOCTOR: Don’t worry, we're not going to [hurt you —] (HURT) Ow!\nDOCTOR: There was no call for that.\nNYSSA: It’s alright, Loki. I know them. They’re not hostile.\nLOKI: [Standing down as instructed. De-activating threat-mode. ]\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 17\nDOCTOR: (OVER LOKI’S LINE)\nDOCTOR: Nyssa!\nNYSSA: Doctor! Tegan!\nTEGAN: What are you doing here?\nNYSSA: I could ask you the same question.\nTEGAN: But Nyssa, you... you look [older —]\nNYSSA: Older? Well, it has been a while since the last time I saw you.\nDOCTOR: How long?\nNYSSA: About fifty years.\nTEGAN: Fifty years? You’re looking pretty good for seventy!\nNYSSA: You forget, Tegan, I do not age at the same rate as you.\nTEGAN: But even so... sorry, what am I saying? I’m just amazed to see you, I never thought I’d see you again.\nNYSSA: I’m glad to see you too. You don’t look very different from how I remember, any of you, not even your clothes. Doctor, how long has it been?\nDOCTOR: Since we said goodbye on Terminus? Two days.\nNYSSA: Two days!\nDOCTOR: Well, time is, ah, relative.\nTEGAN: You can say that again!\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 18\nDOCTOR: Oh, Nyssa. I’m sorry, it’s been such a long time...\nNYSSA: There’s no need to apologise. I always knew you would come back one day — but that I shouldn’t hold my breath waiting.\nTURLOUGH: Hello. Don’t know if you remember me. Turlough.\nNYSSA: From Brendon School. So you’re travelling with the Doctor now?\nTEGAN: It’s a long story. He’s on probation.\nDOCTOR: So, what have you been up to? Your work with the Lazars?\nNYSSA: Ended, almost fifteen years ago. Since I developed a vaccine there hasn’t been a new case for over two decades.\nDOCTOR: I always knew you would do well.\nTEGAN: But what are you doing here? Wherever ‘here’ might be.\nNYSSA: A gene-tech station on the planet Helheim. Forty years ago the crew here were engaged in research into Richter’s Syndrome.\nDOCTOR: Richter’s Syndrome?\nNYSSA: We thought it had been wiped out, until ten years ago, when suddenly a new, more powerful strain emerged as though from nowhere. Within months it had spread across the galaxy. We estimate that over six billion people are now infected.\nTEGAN: Six billion? That’s more than the population of Earth!\nDOCTOR: And the crew of this station were studying it, you say?\nNYSSA: Our hope is that they discovered a cure. Unless we find some way of stopping it, whole worlds will be wiped out.\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 19\nTURLOUGH: And your metal friend?\nNYSSA: This is Loki. My companion and protector.\nTEGAN: (LAUGHS) He’s your bodyguard?\nNYSSA: Amongst other things. He also acts as my personal databank.\nTEGAN: Like a walking, talking filofax!\nNYSSA: Loki, these are my friends, the Doctor, Nyssa and Turlough. You are to obey their commands as you would mine.\nLOKI: Updating records. Will the Doctor be requiring an apology?\nDOCTOR: That won’t be necessary. So Nyssa, is that why you summoned us here? To help?\nNYSSA: Summoned you here? I don’t know what you’re talking about.\nDOCTOR: But if you didn’t bring the TARDIS here, then who did? It does seem an awfully big coincidence...\nTURLOUGH: (READS) ‘Unidentified subterranean ruins’.\nDOCTOR: What?\nTURLOUGH: On the map of the base. It appears to have been constructed on top of some sort of alien remains!\nDOCTOR: Interesting!\nTEGAN: You think there might be something down there? Whatever it was that dragged the TARDIS off course?\nDOCTOR: Well, it’s got to be worth a look, surely?\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 20\nNYSSA: While you’re doing that, Doctor, I’d like to visit the control room, access the neuronic logs. Find out what happened to the crew.\nDOCTOR: Good idea. Tegan can go with you — give you a chance to catch up on old times!\nTEGAN: And what if there’s something in here with us?\nNYSSA: Don’t worry, Tegan. With Loki to protect us, we’re perfectly safe.\nTEGAN: ‘Perfectly safe’? I’ve heard that one before. Usually five seconds before something explodes.\nTEGAN: 10. CONTROL ROOM\nTEGAN: ‘Research station control room?’ The door’s sealed shut.\nNYSSA: Try the entry coder.\nTEGAN: (MUTTERS) For all the good it’ll do us. (RESIGNEDLY, AS SHE\nPRESSES: BUTTONS) One-two-three-four...\nNYSSA: Nothing. Loki, can you over-ride the door security mechanism?\nLOKI: Miss Nyssa. I’m not sure that’s a good idea...\nNYSSA: Just do as you’re told, please.\nTEGAN: I don’t believe it — a superstitious robot!\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 21\nNYSSA: It’s his job, to be sensitive to potential dangers. Sometimes I think I should put him on a lower setting.\nTEGAN: Well, there’s nothing to worry about in here. Just a load of old computers.\nNYSSA: (WORRIED) They should be back on-line by now...\nTEGAN: What was that?\nNYSSA: Some broken glass on the floor. No, not glass. Crystal.\nTEGAN: Maybe they were using this place for a Jewish wedding. Which reminds me, I must have fifty years of gossip to catch up on. So, has there been anyone to help pass you your test-tubes?\nLOKI: (INTERRUPTING) Miss Nyssa! Activating threat-mode. We are not alone.\nNYSSA: Loki? What do you mean?\nLOKI: I am detecting a fourth sentient presence.\nTEGAN: Where is it? I can’t see anything.\nLOKI: It’s all around us... it’s the station itself!\nNYSSA: The base computer!\nEDGAR: I always knew you would return, one day.\nTEGAN: Return? What are you on about?\nEDGAR: That the four of you would come back to me. Tegan. Nyssa. Turlough. And the Doctor...\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 22\nDOCTOR WHO: 11. SUBTERRANEAN RUINS\nDOCTOR: Fascinating! These ruins must be over two thousand years old... Ha! Through here — mysterious engravings!\nTURLOUGH: Doctor. Can I ask you a question?\nDOCTOR: (OBSERVING ALOUD) Some sort of eroded iconography... Go on.\nTURLOUGH: Why do you trust me?\nDOCTOR: Why? Well, do you trust me?\nTURLOUGH: Yes, of course.\nDOCTOR: Then it would be ungracious not to return the compliment.\nTURLOUGH: But when did you realise... about the Black Guardian...\nDOCTOR: (CHANGING THE SUBJECT) You know, there must have been quite an advanced civilisation here once!\nTURLOUGH: With sufficient technology to force the TARDIS to land?\nDOCTOR: Possibly. It’s times like this I wish I still had my sonic screwdriver. Or a decent pickaxe.\nTURLOUGH: (DISTURBED) Doctor...\nDOCTOR: (ENGROSSED) Hmmm?\nTURLOUGH: Look! By the lift shaft.\nDOCTOR: (CURIOUS) I can’t see anything.\nTURLOUGH: (CALLING) No, keep back, please, don’t [shoot —]\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 23\nTURLOUGH: (STUNNED) Aaaaargh!\nDOCTOR: Turlough!\nDOCTOR: 12. CONTROL ROOM\nNYSSA: Computer. Question. How do you know who we are?\nEDGAR: You identified yourselves. When you first came here.\nTEGAN: What d’you mean, when we first came here?\nEDGAR: You arrived forty years, two months and two days ago.\nTEGAN: What? No we didn’t!\nNYSSA: Tegan, we must have been here before!\nTEGAN: But I’d remember! I never forget a disembodied voice!\nNYSSA: But maybe for us it has yet to take place. As the Doctor says — time is relative.\nTEGAN: It might be relative to you but it’s extremely confusing to me.\nLOKI: Miss Nyssa, maybe, er, we should relocate to the scout ship?\nNYSSA: Not yet. Computer. How did you know we would come back?\nEDGAR: You promised Edgar. You promised you would return.\nTEGAN: Did we?\nEDGAR: Edgar has been so lonely. Please have pity on poor Edgar! Edgar begs you most cravenly. Pity me! Pity me! PITY ME!\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 24\nDOCTOR WHO: 13. SUBTERRANEAN RUINS\nTURLOUGH: (COMING TO) Doctor... What happened?\nDOCTOR: You collapsed. What’s the last thing you remember?\nTURLOUGH: There was someone here... I couldn’t make out their face... but they had a weapon of some kind, a gun. They fired at me!\nDOCTOR: I see. Can you stand? (HEAVE)\nTURLOUGH: (STARTLED) Where did they go? Doctor, [are they —]\nDOCTOR: It’s alright. There’s no-one there.\nTURLOUGH: You didn’t see anything?\nDOCTOR: No. But I think you did. An hallucination, perhaps?\nTURLOUGH: Doctor, it was more than an hallucination. I felt the laser hitting my chest! I could smell it burning my clothes —\nDOCTOR: And yet you are entirely unmarked. Come on! Time we got back to the others!\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 25\nDOCTOR WHO: 14. CONTROL ROOM\nNYSSA: If you want us to help you, you have to tell us what you want!\nEDGAR: Edgar has been so lonely. So lonely!\nTEGAN: If you ask me, it’s gone mad. All these years on its own must have sent it completely around the bend.\nNYSSA: It’s possible that some of the neural pathways may have corroded while the computer was in hibernation.\nTEGAN: Doctor, Turlough, did you find anything?\nDOCTOR: The remains of some sort of ancient structure. What about you?\nNYSSA: Doctor, the station computer. It claims we have been here before!\nDOCTOR: Does it now? How very intriguing.\nLOKI: Maintaining threat-mode. I can still hear it... in my mind.\nDOCTOR: Of course! That must be it!\nTEGAN: Must be what?\nDOCTOR: What happened to Turlough. A telepathic memory projection!\nTURLOUGH: You mean, what I saw was somebody else’s memory?\nDOCTOR: Precisely! Stored in the computer, then fed back into your consciousness, vividly accurate in every detail.\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 26\nNYSSA: Doctor. Just before I met you I also had a vision that I was being attacked, by some creatures, like scorpions...\nDOCTOR: The same process! What you saw was the memory of one of the crew of this base, being played back, like a recording!\nTURLOUGH: But I was looking through the eyes of somebody as they were being murdered! If it was the same for Nyssa —\nDOCTOR: You were experiencing their moments of death. Yes. Curious!\nTEGAN: Curious? Is that all you can say? It’s downright morbid!\nDOCTOR: If these memories in the computer, there should be others...\nEDGAR: Doctor. You have returned to me. As you promised you would.\nDOCTOR: Did I?\nEDGAR: You said you would release Edgar, from the endless unrelenting agony of existence...\nDOCTOR: Cheerful soul, aren’t you? Sorry, who is ‘Edgar’?\nTEGAN: It’s what the computer calls itself.\nDOCTOR: Of course — Encephalic Data Gathering And Research! Tell me, Edgar, do you have any records of the original crew of this base?\nEDGAR: Projecting.\nEDGAR: (FX: DISORTED, CRACKLY CLIP FROM SCENE 28. VALIS: But nobody outside the Company knows we’re here. IT CONTINUES IN B/G)\nTEGAN: A hologram!\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 27\nDOCTOR: Not quite. A shared sensory impression. A group hallucination!\nTURLOUGH: This is the whole crew? Three people?\nNYSSA: Edgar. Identify station personnel.\nEDGAR: Helheim gene-tech facility. Director Cardell.\nEDGAR: (FX: CLIP FROM SCENE 41: I didn’t make the system. I only try to live in it.)\nEDGAR: Bio-technician Valis.\nEDGAR: (FX CLIP FROM SCENE 36: You’ll have to manage without me. I can’t just drop what I’m doing.)\nEDGAR: Enforcement Officer Bragg.\nEDGAR: (FX CLIP FROM SCENE 30: Impossible. There’s nowhere within range.)\nTEGAN: It’s so real. It’s almost as if we were there with them...\nDOCTOR: Maybe we were... Edgar — have there been any other visitors to this base?\nEDGAR: Projecting.\nEDGAR: (FX: CLIP FROM SCENE 57: NYSSA: Doctor! DOCTOR: Nyssa, Turlough, Cardell! No time to explain —)\nTEGAN: That’s us! That’s us!\nDOCTOR: Edgar, end projection.\nTEGAN: Hey, I was watching that!\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 28\nDOCTOR: Not healthy to know too much about one’s own future.\nTEGAN: What you talking about? We don’t know what happened to these people. We don’t know what happened to us!\nDOCTOR: And we can’t know, don’t you see? We mustn’t risk finding out something that might prejudice our future actions!\nTEGAN: Computer! What happened to the crew of this station?\nEDGAR: Pity poor Edgar. Pity me! Pity me! Pity me!\nTEGAN: Never mind that. What happened to the people who were here forty years ago? Where are they? What did you do with them?\nEDGAR: You promised Edgar, Doctor. Take the past away! Please!\nTEGAN: Where are they, you blasted machine!\nEDGAR: Medical bay. Second level.\nTEGAN: Right. I’m going to take a look!\nDOCTOR: Tegan! (BEAT) Sometimes it feels like I spend half my life chasing after that woman...\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 29\nDOCTOR WHO: 15. MEDICAL BAY\nTEGAN: Alright. Open this thing up!\nEDGAR: The medical bay has been sealed. From the inside.\nTEGAN: How does that work? Is there another way in?\nEDGAR: Negative.\nTEGAN: Doctor, this computer thing says the door’s locked.\nDOCTOR: Well, perhaps that’s just as well.\nNYSSA: Tegan, the Doctor’s right.\nTEGAN: Oh no. There must be some way of getting this thing open. (BEAT) You. Tik Tok.\nLOKI: Me?\nTEGAN: Can you open this door?\nLOKI: I can over-ride the security mechanism. But I don’t think it’s a very good idea...\nTEGAN: Never mind that, just do it! Nyssa said you should whatever we ask, didn’t she?\nNYSSA: Loki, no!\nTURLOUGH: It would appear that it’s too late.\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 30\nNYSSA: Scan the atmosphere!\nLOKI: No detectable airborne pathogens.\nTEGAN: There. Even R-2-D-2 thinks it’s safe.\nTEGAN: (FX: TEGAN ENTERING THE MEDICAL BAY, FOLLOWED BY OTHERS.\nLIGHTS: FLICKERING ON)\nTEGAN: (REACTS) Ugh! What happened to this place? It’s all... cobwebs!\nNYSSA: Loki. Any signs of life?\nLOKI: None that I can detect, Miss Nyssa.\nTURLOUGH: That might be the case, but I don’t think we’re entirely alone.\nTEGAN: What do you mean?\nTURLOUGH: Look. The beds.\nDOCTOR: Four bodies.\nTEGAN: Wrapped up in cocoons? There doesn’t seem to be anything left of them apart from the bones.\nNYSSA: But there were only three people in the crew...\nTURLOUGH: This one, it has some clothes, or what remains of them.\nTEGAN: And this one. And just look at what it’s wearing!\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 31\nDOCTOR: Some sort of suit.. or a school uniform. Like Turlough’s.\nTURLOUGH: And this one’s wearing a survival suit. Like Nyssa’s.\nNYSSA: This one has the same clothes that Tegan is wearing now...\nTEGAN: And this one has what’s left of a cricketing outfit.\nTURLOUGH: Then that would seem to confirm it. These skeletons —\nTEGAN: They’re us? Doctor? (BEAT) Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Yes. It seems it is our destiny to go back in time and become these corpses. They are all that remains... of our future selves!\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 32"

It seems it is our destiny to go back in time and become these corpses. They are all that remains... of our future selves!\nTEGAN: No. No, I don’t believe it! It’s a set-up! Something brought the TARDIS here, right? Well, whatever it was, it put these... things here too!\nDOCTOR: And why do you think they would’ve done that, hmmm?\nTEGAN: Somebody’s idea of a sick joke? I don’t know! But whatever the reason is, those bodies are not us.\nTURLOUGH: Tegan does have a point, Doctor. We can’t be absolutely certain these skeletons are our future selves.\nDOCTOR: I suppose it is a possibility... albeit an unlikely one.\nNYSSA: We should at least check. Loki. What do you make of them?\nLOKI: Remains appear consistent with humanoid organisms. As far as I can detect... oh, Varsak’s beard! They‘re you. The four of you!\nTEGAN: Well, if you think I’m trusting the word of that jumped-up one-armed bandit, you’re very much mistaken!\nDOCTOR: Very well. Nyssa, if you could help me take samples... we’ll see what light the base’s laboratory can shed on the matter.\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 33\nTEGAN: How much longer’s it going to take?\nDOCTOR: Patience. Just getting the results of the spectrographic test!\nTEGAN: Turlough, can’t you leave anything alone for five minutes?\nTURLOUGH: These cages. They’re metal, heavy, reinforced metal.\nTEGAN: So?\nTURLOUGH: So I think whatever they were experimenting with here, it was somewhat larger — and more savage — than a virus!\nDOCTOR: Well, that appears to be conclusive. The cells of the remains match our own, even down to the genetic signature.\nNYSSA: And they would’ve been approximately our ages when they died.\nTEGAN: (SARCASTIC) Well, that’s very reassuring!\nTURLOUGH: Couldn’t they be clones of some sort? Duplicates?\nDOCTOR: It’ll be several centuries before that technology exists in this corner of the galaxy, I’m afraid.\nNYSSA: Doctor. There is another possibility. They could be alternative versions of us, from another time-stream. Like when we visited Stockbridge?\nDOCTOR: There’s one simple way to find out! Tegan, take these scissors, make a cut in the lining of Turlough’s jacket!\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 34\nTURLOUGH: (SURPRISED) What?\nTEGAN: A cut? Where?\nDOCTOR: Doesn’t matter, anywhere you like, just a snip. Well, go on!\nTEGAN: Alright... but I don’t see [what this —]\nTURLOUGH: Excuse me, but why does it have to be my jacket?\nDOCTOR: Now, Nyssa, the jacket you took from the Turlough skeleton. Is\nDOCTOR: there a cut in the lining?\nNYSSA: (AMAZED) Yes, there — in precisely the same place...\nDOCTOR: Then that proves it.\nTEGAN: (DISMISSIVE) That proves it? A lame-brained conjuring trick?\nDOCTOR: Tegan, how much more evidence do you need? We know we’ve been here before — or that we will have been here before — because the base computer recognised us, because we’ve seen ourselves in the memory records!\nTEGAN: Well, in that case, I’m getting out of here.\nDOCTOR: Tegan —!\nTEGAN: You might want to stick around and get killed, but I’d rather not if it’s all the same to you!\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 35\nDOCTOR: Tegan, wait! (CATCHES UP) Where do you think you’re going?\nTEGAN: Where do you think? Back to the TARDIS!\nDOCTOR: And then what?\nTEGAN: Go somewhere else, anywhere else! Forget this whole place ever existed and never come back!\nDOCTOR: Running away won’t solve anything.\nTEGAN: You want to bet? I say we do our best to make sure we don’t end up as a load of skeletons, and the best way of doing that is by going somewhere as far away as possible!\nDOCTOR: We can’t do that.\nTEGAN: Oh, really?\nDOCTOR: To use knowledge of the future to prevent it from occurring would cause a temporal negation paradox.\nTEGAN: Is that the best you can do? This is my life you’re talking about! Turlough’s life, Nyssa’s life, your life. Isn’t that more important to you than having a few points on your time travel licence?\nDOCTOR: It doesn’t work like that. I only wish it did.\nTEGAN: I don’t care! You’re the Time Lord, you sort it out! But I can tell you one thing.. if those corpses are what the future has in store then it’s a future that I’m not gonna allow to happen!\nTEGAN: (FX: DURING THE FOLLOWING, WE SHIFT TO EDGAR’S POINT OF VIEW — AS THOUGH EAVESDROPPING ON THE CONVERSATION WITH HIDDEN MICS)\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 36\nDOCTOR: But we know we end up travelling back in time —\nTEGAN: No, we don’t! You can if you like, but you can include me out!\nEDGAR: But you promised me, Doctor. You promised poor Edgar. You can’t leave me alone again. You can’t! You can’t!\nLOKI: Threat-mode increasing, Miss Nyssa. I recommend we return to the scout ship and depart immediately.\nLOKI: (FX: WE LEAVE EDGAR’S POV. NYSSA IS PRESSING BUTTONS, TRYING TO GET THE EQUIPMENT TO WORK)\nNYSSA: Not until we’ve got what we came for. The answer must lie in the neuronic logs somewhere.\nTURLOUGH: What was it the Doctor said, about us finding out too much about our own futures?\nNYSSA: This is too important. If the people here found a cure —\nTURLOUGH: - the details would be recorded in their memories. Ah. Yes.\nNYSSA: I’ve seen similar systems elsewhere. At the end of each day you upload your memories into the database, so you can access them for future reference, share them with others, even recall past events without loss of accuracy.\nTURLOUGH: Ingenious. And I suppose it saves having to write things down!\nNYSSA: This might be it — Edgar, play Cardell’s final entry.\nNYSSA: (FX: BUTTONS PRESSED. A PROJECTION — DIALOGUE FROM SCENE 63: “This is Director Cardell, Helheim gene-tech research station. We have discovered a cure for Richter’s syndrome, and we —“)\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 37\nNYSSA: They did it! Edgar, continue playback.\nEDGAR: Unable to comply.\nNYSSA: What?\nEDGAR: File terminated.\nNYSSA: Edgar, play all other memory records relating to research into Richter’s Syndrome.\nEDGAR: No records available.\nTURLOUGH: That’s computers for you. Unreliable!\nNYSSA: Unless... Loki, could you link your neural [functions —] Loki? Oh, where has that robot go to?\nTURLOUGH: It mentioned something about returning to your scout ship?\nNYSSA: (LEAVING) Come on. He can’t have got far...\nDOCTOR: Tegan, aren’t you even a little bit curious to find out what happened here?\nTEGAN: Not if it means my own death, no!\nTEGAN: (FX: CLANG. METAL DOOR SLAMS. HISSING SOUND — AIRLOCK CLOSING.\nSEE: SCENE 56)\nTEGAN: What the... that door wasn’t there a second ago!\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 38\nDOCTOR: What door?\nTEGAN: Can’t you see it? Like some sort of airlock or bulkhead.\nDOCTOR: Tegan, close your eyes, concentrate...\nTEGAN: And there’s a sound, like escaping gas.. (GASPS) Doctor. I can’t.. I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe!\nDOCTOR: Tegan, you’re experiencing another memory projection. It’s not\nDOCTOR: real, it’s an artificially-induced illusion!\nTEGAN: Yes.. but you saying that doesn’t actually help very much!\nDOCTOR: No. Computer — Edgar. Cancel projection! Cancel!\nEDGAR: Cancelling.\nTEGAN: (DEEP BREATH) Thank goodness for that. I thought I was going to suffocate!\nDOCTOR: No, vivid as the experience may be, I don’t think the memories can harm you.\nTEGAN: So what just happened, that was what Turlough and Nyssa saw? Somebody’s final moments before they died? Being suffocated in an airlock?\nDOCTOR: Grisly, isn’t it? Edgar seems to have been instructed to play back those specific memories. I wonder why?\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 39\nDOCTOR WHO: 21. SPACECRAFT\nNYSSA: Loki — what are you doing?\nLOKI: Threat-mode now beyond all toleration levels! Miss Nyssa, I can’t bear it any more. We have to leave — and leave now!\nNYSSA: But if you can’t identify the nature of the threat —\nLOKI: It’s inside my mind. I can hear it. (BEAT) It is screaming.\nTURLOUGH: What is? The base computer? Edgar?\nLOKI: It will kill all of you, I know it! I don’t know how, but I can sense what’s going to happen! I can see it!\nTURLOUGH: Those skeletons must have scared him out of his wits.\nNYSSA: Loki, I know you’re frightened, but you have to learn to moderate your threat responses.\nLOKI: Please. We have to take off. If we stay here... we’1ll die! I know it!\nTURLOUGH: Nyssa. I don’t want to alarm you, but there’s something in the ship with us — it’s forced open one of the overhead panels —\nNYSSA: Maintenance spiders! They must have got in through the fuel ducts.\nLOKI: They were here when I arrived, I couldn’t stop them.\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 40\nTURLOUGH: They seem more intent on ripping the power feeds to shreds than performing ‘maintenance’.\nLOKI: According to my sensors, hyperspace drives have begun ignition.\nNYSSA: What? But if they’re triggered while the ship’s on the ground\nTURLOUGH: - it will cause a very large explosion.\nNYSSA: We have to move. Quick, Loki! Into the airlock!\nTURLOUGH: Can’t your metal friend move any faster? He’ll get us killed!\nNYSSA: Quickly, Loki, seal the airlock door. Hurry!\nEDGAR: Now you can’t leave me. Edgar will never be left alone again!\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 41\nDOCTOR WHO: 22. CORRIDOR NEAR AIRLOCK\nDOCTOR: Alright?\nTEGAN: (RECOVERING) It might have only been an hallucination, but it was a bit too realistic for comfort!\nDOCTOR: Yes. It [would seem —]\nTEGAN: What was that?\nDOCTOR: Nyssa’s ship. It’s been destroyed!\nTEGAN: What? But how —\nDOCTOR: Nyssa, Turlough, you’re safe. What happened?\nNYSSA: My ship... the repair spiders broke in, started dismantling it!\nTURLOUGH: It was deliberate sabotage, Doctor. They caused the explosion.\nTEGAN: Or whatever controls them did.\nDOCTOR: Edgar. Yes. He does seem determined that we shouldn’t leave.\nTEGAN: Well, if it wants us to stay, why is it trying to kill us?\nEDGAR: Edgar does not wish you any harm. Edgar intends to save you!\nDOCTOR: Save us?\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 42\nEDGAR: You have seen your fate. With poor Edgar left in the darkness. Pity me. Pity me!\nDOCTOR: Yes, you have my sympathy, but how are you trying to save us?\nEDGAR: Take the past away. Edgar knows the four of you can travel in time. Edgar, he saw you before, many years ago. The blue box.\nTEGAN: It knows about the TARDIS?\nEDGAR: I beg you. Please. Go back. Save them. Save poor Edgar!\nDOCTOR: Of course. It wants us to change the past. Edgar wants us to prevent the base’s crew from being killed!\nDOCTOR: 23. CORRIDOR\nTEGAN: But if the crew were killed, where are the bodies? Shouldn’t there be three more corpses lying about the place?\nDOCTOR: Yes. That does seem odd, now you mention it.\nTEGAN: I’1l tell you something else that’s odd. If those remains are our future selves — and I’m not admitting they are — but if they are, then where’s their TARDIS?\nTURLOUGH: There’s also the small matter of the alien ruins. If they disturbed something down there, something buried...\nDOCTOR: Yes. Too many questions. And unfortunately only one way of finding the answers.\nNYSSA: By travelling back in the TARDIS.\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 43\nTEGAN: Oh no. No way. I’d rather live out my days in ignorance.\nTURLOUGH: For what it’s worth, I agree with Tegan. I have no desire to end up a rotting corpse in a research station medical bay!\nDOCTOR: Nor do I. But with time travel, there are rules. Rules that cannot be broken.\nTEGAN: Since when did you ever care for rules?\nDOCTOR: This is different.\nTEGAN: Too right it is!\nNYSSA: But Tegan, we don’t have any choice. [We have to —]\nTEGAN: Oh, surprise surprise! You’re on the Doctor’s side. As usual!\nEDGAR: Commencing gene-tech facility emergency quarantine procedure.\nDOCTOR: Edgar, what do you mean, emergency quarantine procedure?\nEDGAR: Initiating total eradication of Helheim gene-tech facility.\nTEGAN: It’s started the self-destruct! If you ask me, that computer’s totally doolally.\nDOCTOR: No-one is asking you. Edgar, cancel emergency quarantine!\nEDGAR: Procedure irreversible. Commencing ignition of plasma fission reactors.\nTURLOUGH: The ultimate safeguard — taking the nuclear option!\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 44\nNYSSA: (REMEMBERING) Loki. Where is Loki? We have to find him!\nTEGAN: Haven’t you got more important things to worry about than that dratted robot?\nDOCTOR: Tegan, Turlough, go back to the TARDIS, wait for us there.\nTEGAN: What about you?\nDOCTOR: We'll be right behind you. Tegan, you can argue with me later. Run!\nTEGAN: At least we’ll be getting out of here!\nNYSSA: Doctor, we [need to —]\nDOCTOR: I know. Edgar, locate Nyssa’s companion, designation — Loki!\nEDGAR: Device located in facility control room.\nDOCTOR: Come on!\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 45\nDOCTOR WHO: 24. CONTROL ROOM\nDOCTOR: Now, if I can re-initialise the computer’s command protocols —\nNYSSA: Loki! What are you doing here?\nLOKI: Identifying the source of threat-mode. As instructed.\nNYSSA: Never mind that. We have to leave, in the Doctor’s TARDIS.\nLOKI: TARDIS? What’s a TARDIS?\nNYSSA: It’s a type of time machine, a blue box.\nLOKI: Time machine. Blue box. Updating records.\nNYSSA: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Nearly there. Just have to by-pass Edgar’s logic functions...\nEDGAR: No, Doctor. Pity me. Pity poor Edgar. Permit me to die.\nNYSSA: The computer — it’s attempting to commit suicide?\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid so. Edgar, don’t do this! I’m trying to help you...\nEDGAR: Deleting mainframe memory records. Uninstalling all programmes.\nNYSSA: Can’t you stop it?\nDOCTOR: I’m doing my best, but it’s not responding. (THUMPS DESK)\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 46\nEDGAR: Memory records twenty per-cent remaining. Fifteen per-cent.\nDOCTOR: Edgar, listen to me! You’re wiping your own mind!\nEDGAR: Pity me. Pity me. Pity me.\nNYSSA: It’s dying.\nEDGAR: Memory records five per-cent remaining. Four. Three. Two. Logic functions deleted. Primary operating system deleted.\nDOCTOR: It’s too late. It’s stopped.\nNYSSA: But the countdown to the emergency quarantine hasn't!\nDOCTOR: No. You’re right. There’s nothing we can do. We have to go!\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 47\nDOCTOR WHO: 25. CONSOLE ROOM\nTEGAN: Doctor, what happened?\nDOCTOR: I’ll explain later. Close the doors, we've only a few seconds left!\nNYSSA: Wait, Loki’s still outside. (CALLS TO HIM) Hurry, Loki!\nLOKI: I’m sorry, Miss Nyssa. I wasn’t built for rapid movement.\nDOCTOR: Hold on, I’m going to have to perform a temporal shift before\nDOCTOR: we’re caught in the explosion!\nTURLOUGH: Can’t we just dematerialise?\nDOCTOR: No time — watch out, here it comes!\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 48\nDOCTOR WHO: 26. CONTROL ROOM\nCARDELL: Edgar. Save my memories, tag Richter’s, research, Director Cardell, day ninety-seven, duration sixteen hours.\nEDGAR: Uploading memory record... Memory uploaded.\nCARDELL: Marvellous. Have the others saved any new memories yet?\nEDGAR: Enforcement Officer Bragg has uploaded one new memory. Tag subterranean ruins research analysis. Duration three hours.\nCARDELL: Okay, I think I can cope without having three hours of paranoid speculation downloaded into my brain. Anything else?\nEDGAR: Alert! Security breach in level three.\nCARDELL: What? Visual.\nCARDELL: What is it, some sort of transmat capsule? Looks archaic.\nEDGAR: Object defies analysis. Scanners unable to penetrate exterior. Appearance does not correspond with any known device.\nCARDELL: Oh, ice in Hell. The last thing we need. Edgar, get me Valis.\nVALIS: (VIA RADIO) What is it? I’m right in the middle of —\nCARDELL: Sorry to interrupt, but, well, you’ve got to see this. A blue\nCARDELL: box has just appeared out of nowhere.\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 49\nVALIS: Isn’t this Bragg’s responsibility? I’m really busy right now —\nCARDELL: (VIA RADIO)\nCARDELL: You’re always busy. Get yourself down there. That’s an order.\nVALIS: (VIA RADIO)\nVALIS: Fine, fine, whatever, I’m on my way.\nCARDELL: Edgar, get me Bragg. Don’t tell me, he’s digging up ‘relics’...\nBRAGG: (VIA RADIO)\nBRAGG: What do you want, director?\nCARDELL: A security breach, level three. Some sort of transmat capsule.\nBRAGG: (VIA RADIO)\nBRAGG: But that’s impossible, we’re out of range for any — (transmat)\nCARDELL: So maybe you should stop skulking around in the dark and do what you’re paid for. Oh, and just in case — armed response.\nBRAGG: (VIA RADIO)\nBRAGG: Understood. Can’t be too careful!\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 50\nDOCTOR WHO: 27. CONSOLE ROOM\nDOCTOR: Same location, forty years, two months and two days earlier.\nTEGAN: Doesn’t look very different.\nDOCTOR: What were you expecting?\nTEGAN: I don’t know... Except there’s no cobwebs. It’s clean. New.\nNYSSA: At this point in time, it is new. The station has only been operational for a few months.\nTURLOUGH: And it seems our presence has not gone entirely unnoticed...\nDOCTOR: What? Oh, yes. Don’t look very pleased to see us, do they?\nDOCTOR: 28. BASE CORRIDOR\nCARDELL: What do you make of it? Bragg?\nBRAGG: A container of some sort? Made of processed xylem. There’s a door. ‘Pull to open’.\nVALIS: You think there’s somebody inside?\nCARDELL: Possibly. Could be agents working for one of the independents.\nVANCE: But nobody outside the Company knows we’re here.\nCARDELL: Then maybe somebody on the inside tipped them off? What, do you think this thing just landed here by accident?\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 51\nDOCTOR WHO: 29. CONSOLE ROOM.\nTEGAN: So that’s the crew of this place. While they were still alive.\nDOCTOR: Tegan. If you’re suggesting what I think you’re suggesting —\nTEGAN: Why not? We can warn them. Stop them getting killed.\nDOCTOR: No. What’s done is done.\nTEGAN: You’d rather just let them die? That’s what you want?\nDOCTOR: No! What do you take me for? Don’t you think I’d love to be able to change history? Save Joan of Arc from execution. Prevent Franz Ferdinand being assassinated? Don’t you think I’d do that if I could?\nTEGAN: Then why don’t you?\nDOCTOR: Because I can’t. Because... because —\nTEGAN: Because it’s against the rules. The Time Lord code. You said.\nNYSSA: Tegan, [if you think —]\nTEGAN: Nyssa, don’t say anything! There’s nothing you could say that\nTEGAN: would make me less furious right now! I know what you’re going to say; the Doctor’s right, he knows best. Well, in this case, he doesn’t!\nDOCTOR: I can’t force you to come with me, any of you. You can stay in the TARDIS if that’s what you want.\nTEGAN: Too right I’m staying!\nDOCTOR: Turlough?\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 52\nTURLOUGH: I’m sorry, but I’m with Tegan on this.\nDOCTOR: Nyssa?\nNYSSA: Those people have discovered a cure for Richter’s, that’s all that matters. My personal fate is irrelevant in comparison.\nTEGAN: (HUMPH!) I knew it!\nDOCTOR: Very well. Nyssa — will your, ah, robot friend be joining us?\nNYSSA: Loki? You’re very quiet. Are you alright?\nLOKI: All systems at optimum efficiency. I must accompany you. I... I have a duty to make sure you’re safe.\nNYSSA: Good. We might need some protection...\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 53\nDOCTOR WHO: 30. BASE CORRIDOR\nBRAGG: Don’t move. Either of you.\nDOCTOR: Hello. I’m the Doctor, this is my friend Nyssa, and her friend, Loki. Don’t worry, we don’t pose any sort of threat!\nBRAGG: I said don’t move!\nDOCTOR: As you can see, we’re unarmed. Entirely at your mercy! So there’s absolutely no need to point a gun at us.\nCARDELL: What are you doing here? This is a top-security facility!\nVALIS: This ‘Police Box’ — it’s your transmat?\nDOCTOR: Something like that, yes.\nBRAGG: Impossible. There’s nowhere within range. Nowhere!\nNYSSA: Our survey ship crashed on the opposite side of the planet. This is our escape capsule.\nVALIS: Interesting design.\nDOCTOR: Disguise. Based on an old Arcadian prayer booth. Devoted to the great god Pol-ick-eh Box.\nBRAGG: Any more of you in there?\nDOCTOR: Hardly. Does it look like there’d be room?\nCARDELL: You haven’t answered my question. What are you doing here? This system isn’t on any trade routes —\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 54\nNYSSA: We’ve come to see you, Director Cardell. Bio-technician Valis.\nVALIS: You know who we are?\nDOCTOR: Ah, yes. We’re here on behalf of your employers. Inspection!\nVALIS: You're from the Company?\nDOCTOR: That’s right. Unfortunately our papers were on our ship... but, well, we'd hardly know about this place and who you are, if we weren’t. It is a top secret facility, after all!\nNYSSA: We’re here to report on your progress on Richter’s Syndrome.\nCARDELL: (LAUGHS) Our progress?\nNYSSA: It is the objective of your research?\nCARDELL: It’s our objective, but if you’re expecting good news, you’re in for a disappointment.\nVALIS: We’ve been working on it for over ninety days without success. We’re still months, if not years, away from finding a cure!\nNYSSA: What?\nCARDELL: Valis. I think perhaps we should show them our ‘research’...\nBRAGG: But we can’t be sure they’re not spies.\nCARDELL: Don’t worry, Bragg. If it turns out they’ve been lying to us, I’1ll be only too delighted to let you execute them. But until that time.. Doctor, Nyssa, if you would care to follow me?\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 55\nDOCTOR WHO: 31. CONSOLE ROOM.\nTURLOUGH: The Doctor seems to have won them over.\nTEGAN: It’s a knack he has.\nTURLOUGH: I wonder where they’re taking him.\nTEGAN: Does it matter? We know where he ends up.\nTURLOUGH: Yes. And us too.\nTEGAN: Not if we remain in here. We’re safe.\nTURLOUGH: How can we be sure of that? For all we know, this might be what we are supposed to do!\nTEGAN: What do you mean?\nTURLOUGH: I mean, remaining in the TARDIS might be precisely what causes us to end up dead.\nTEGAN: Then what do you suggest?\nTURLOUGH: You said it yourself. We use our knowledge of the future to prevent it from coming about!\nTEGAN: You mean, warn the crew?\nTURLOUGH: We know the manner of their deaths. If we can change that then we can save ourselves. Well? Or would you rather stay here and do nothing? Just as the Doctor wanted?\nTEGAN: When you put it like that...\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 56\nDOCTOR WHO: 32. LABORATORY\nNYSSA: (WHISPER) Doctor. Those things, they’re what attacked me in the memory projection! I mean, the person whose memory I saw!\nDOCTOR: (QUIET) Probably best to keep that to ourselves for now. (LOUD) Director Cardell, what are these creatures? Some sort of marine crustacean?\nCARDELL: Cractids. They’re the reason we’ve come here, aside from the isolation. They’re the only indigenous species on this rock.\nNYSSA: They’ve evolved to survive in the toxic atmosphere?\nVALIS: More than that. They’re the only organism in the galaxy with a natural immunity to the Richter’s virus.\nDOCTOR: So that’s why you’re so interested in them. (SNAPPED) Ouch!\nCARDELL: Mind your fingers. A swarm of these things could consume you, flesh and bones, in under a minute.\nNYSSA: So you infect them with the virus, then attempt to replicate the antivirals?\nCARDELL: Sadly the problem of genetic incompatibility has proved insurmountable. The Cractid response is unique, we can’t splice its genetic pattern into the human immune system.\nNYSSA: Have you tried reversing the process?\nVALIS: What do you mean?\nDOCTOR: (TRYING TO SHUSH HER) Nyssa — !\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 57\nNYSSA: Rather than alter the human immune system to mimic the Cractid response, why not adapt the Cractid antigen to function as part of the human immune system?\nCARDELL: Because that... actually, that’s not a bad idea.\nVALIS: It might just work. It’s got to be worth a try at least...\nVALIS: 33. CONTROL ROOM\nBRAGG: Edgar, open an emergency com-link with Command Echelon.\nEDGAR: Establishing communication. Established. Encryption on.\nBRAGG: This is Helheim gene-tech station, Enforcement Officer Bragg speaking.\nECHELON: (VIA RADIO)\nECHELON: Receiving you. What’s the fire? You’re not due to call-in for another orbit cycle.\nBRAGG: Report three new arrivals — two humans, one guardian robot. They claim to have been sent by the Company.\nECHELON: (VIA RADIO)\nECHELON: There’s nothing down on the schedule.\nBRAGG: Knew it. They’re from an independent.\nECHELON: (VIA RADIO)\nECHELON: You know what to do?\nBRAGG: Oh yes. I know what to do. (SIGNING OFF) Praise to Magni and Modi.\nECHELEN: (VIA RADIO) Magni and Modi.\nBRAGG: Edgar, shut down com-link.\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 58\nEDGAR: Ending communication. Alert. Two more unauthorised personnel have emerged from the object on level three.\nBRAGG: What? Visual.\nTEGAN: (VIA SCANNER)\nTEGAN: Who are we looking for?\nTURLOUGH: (VIA SCANNER)\nTURLOUGH: We need to speak to someone away from the Doctor and Nyssa, convince them to listen to us, before it’s too late.\nBRAGG: Two more spies!\nBRAGG: What — oh, the girl’s pet robot. What are you doing here?\nLOKI: I.. I don’t know. Investigating source of threat. You must not harm Nyssa and her companions. I must protect them... I... I...\nBRAGG: Oh, you’re going to have to try harder than that, my friend.\nLOKI: Do not attempt to attack. I am equipped with numerous defence mechanisms!\nBRAGG: I don’t take orders from saboteurs.\nBRAGG: Well, come on then, shoot back! What’s stopping you?\nLOKI: Defensive capability compromised.\nBRAGG: Come on! Shoot me, you pathetic machine!\nLOKI: Complete systems failure. I... I.. I knew something bad was going to happen! (DIES)\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 59\nDOCTOR WHO: 34. LABORATORY\nNYSSA: You’re not harming them?\nCARDELL: To be honest, they’re so vicious anyway, how would you tell?\nNYSSA: So, Valis.. what did you do, before you came here?\nVALIS: (SMALL LAUGH) Can’t remember.\nNYSSA: You can’t remember?\nVALIS: All the crew, when we were assigned to this mission, had our memories erased.\nDOCTOR: Interesting. So as far as you’re concerned, you have no past?\nVALIS: No past, no family, no friends. The idea is that it frees up brain capacity, makes it simpler for us to pool our memories.\nNYSSA: You sound like you don’t mind?\nVALIS: How can you miss what you don’t remember? Besides, all our memories are stored on a crystal lattice. When we find the cure, finish our task, then we get our pasts back.\nDOCTOR: But until then, you don’t even know who you are. A blank page!\nVALIS: Why are you asking all this? It’s standard Company policy.\nDOCTOR: Of course. Must have, er, slipped my mind! You know how it is!\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 60\nDOCTOR WHO: 35. BASE CORRIDOR\nTEGAN: Remind me again why we decided to do this.\nTURLOUGH: You can go back to the TARDIS if you like.\nBRAGG: No. I wouldn’t attempt to escape, if you want to live.\nTURLOUGH: We've been looking for you. We have important information to tell you, about your future!\nTURLOUGH: 36. LABORATORY\nTURLOUGH: (FX: FUTURISTIC INJECTION MACHINE — THE SAME ONE WE’LL HEAR\nBEING: USED IN PART FOUR TO DISPENSE THE ANTIVIRUS CURE.)\nVALIS: Injecting modified Cractid antigen into human cell culture...\nTEGAN: Hey, watch that thing!\nDOCTOR: Tegan. Turlough. I thought you were going to wait in the TARDIS?\nTURLOUGH: We, ah, changed our minds.\nTEGAN: We have to warn these people, Doctor. Tell them what’s going to happen.\nDOCTOR: What? No. Remember what I told you, we mustn’t interfere!\nCARDELL: Bragg, who are these people?\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 61\nBRAGG: I’ve spoken to Command Echelon. They haven’t sent anyone to check up on us. These people are saboteurs. Spies!\nNYSSA: But we’ve been helping you! We’d hardly do that — (if we)\nBRAGG: Silence! Valis, Cardell, you know the procedure for dealing with intruders.\nVALIS: You’1l have to manage without me. I can’t just drop what I’m doing, the experiment is at a crucial stage...\nCARDELL: It’s alright, Bragg, I’1ll assist you.\nBRAGG: Then if you’d like to help me escort them to the medical bay...\nBRAGG: 37. MEDICAL BAY\nBRAGG: Inside!\nTEGAN: What are you going to do with us?\nBRAGG: You'll see. Each of you. Onto the beds.\nTURLOUGH: What?\nBRAGG: You heard me. Onto the beds, you — over there — you, ‘Doctor’ — take this one. You, Turlough. And don’t bother struggling, the straps tighten automatically.\nDOCTOR: You’re making a terrible mistake!\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 62\nBRAGG: How can I be making a mistake? I’m merely following procedure. Director Cardell. Ready with the lethal injections?\nCARDELL: Ready.\nBRAGG: You should be grateful. It’s a painless death. Instantaneous. One small jab with a needle.. and you’1ll never feel anything ever again.\nTURLOUGH: You can’t do this. We’re the only ones who can help you!\nTEGAN: We've seen the future. If you kill us, you’re all going to die.\nBRAGG: No. I think you’ll find you’re the ones who are going to die.\nBRAGG: Director Cardell. If you’d care to commence the injections?\nTEGAN: (STRUGGLING) No. No!\nCARDELL: Hold still... don’t worry, this won’t hurt a bit...\nNYSSA: (WHISPER) Doctor. The four skeletons in the medical bay...\nDOCTOR: Yes. It seems our future has finally caught up with us!\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 63"

I’1ll repair you, — (somehow)\nLOKI: As far as I can tell, I am beyond restoration, I’m afraid, lI...\nNYSSA: What?\nLOKI: I am afraid. I am close to the point of inoperability.\nNYSSA: Listen, Loki, you reserve your power, the — (Doctor and I)\nEDGAR: Director. There is a message included in your memory lattice.\nCARDELL: A message? Who from?\nEDGAR: Message Signatory: Director Cardell.\nCARDELL: Play.\nCARDELL: (RECORDING)\nCARDELL: If you’re hearing this, you’ve found a cure. Congratulations. As your memories are restored, you’ll recall the real purpose of your mission. Your objective is to genetically re-engineer a new, more powerful strain of the Richter’s virus. One which can only be cured using a product licensed to the Company!\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 69\nNYSSA: You don’t look pleased.\nCARDELL: What in the name of the nine worlds do you think? (REGAINS COMPOSURE) But it’s who I am.\nNYSSA: So your mission wasn’t to find a cure for the disease. You’re here to create a new and more deadly form!\nCARDELL: Standard marketing practice. Create a product, then create demand! Once you’ve patented the cure, you re-engineer the virus to be impervious to all other treatments, then release it into society and clean up.\nNYSSA: But that’s obscene!\nCARDELL: That’s not my concern. The Company’s done it before. Plague as an economic filter! The rich pay for treatment, and any surplus population is... economized.\nNYSSA: Billions of innocent people will die!\nCARDELL: I didn’t make the system. I only try to live in it.\nNYSSA: You still have a choice!\nCARDELL: Oh no. I don’t have any choice in the matter. I remember that quite clearly; the lives of my children are dependent upon it. No, a new form of the virus must be generated. (BEAT) And the ironic thing is we couldn’t have done it without you!\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 70\nDOCTOR WHO: 42. MEDICAL BAY\nTURLOUGH: (CALLS OUT) Computer. Computer. (BEAT) Edgar!\nEDGAR: You wish to communicate?\nTURLOUGH: Listen! My friends and I are from the future. We have travelled back in time, because your future self wanted us to prevent the others from being killed.\nEDGAR: I am aware of the explanation for your presence.\nTURLOUGH: Well, then, release me. Use the maintenance spiders! Send them in through the ventilation ducts!\nEDGAR: Unable to comply.\nTURLOUGH: What?\nEDGAR: You do not have access privileges. I am not authorised to act upon your instructions.\nTURLOUGH: (GIVING UP) Computers!\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 71\nDOCTOR WHO: 43. SUBTERRANEAN RUINS\nTEGAN: What are we looking for? Looks like a load of old rubble to me.\nDOCTOR: Shhh, Tegan. Mr Bragg has something he wishes to share with us.\nBRAGG: There! Look, can’t you see?\nDOCTOR: (PLAYING ALONG) Oh, yes. Yes, of course!\nTEGAN: I can’t see anything.\nDOCTOR: Humour him, Tegan. You never know, he might be onto something.\nTEGAN: (QUIET) Might be on something, more like!\nBRAGG: The inscription. It’s the giveaway!\nDOCTOR: The giveaway?\nBRAGG: What’s down here — it’s our real past. We think we’ve come from the stars, but the truth is, there is nowhere else. This is all there ever has been, ever will be!\nTEGAN: (QUIET) He’s round the bend.\nDOCTOR: Quite possibly. He’s had all memories of the time before he came here removed, bound to play havoc with one’s sanity.\nBRAGG: But that’s just it. There was no before. It’s alla lie!\nTEGAN: (WHISPER) There’s nothing here, is there?\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 72\nDOCTOR: (WHISPER) No. Sometimes an alien ruin is just an alien ruin!\nBRAGG: (SUSPICIOUS) What are you saying?\nDOCTOR: We were wondering if you would care to, ah, read out this inscription of yours?\nBRAGG: Isn’t it obvious?\nTEGAN: Not to me, no.\nBRAGG: It’s our names. Engraved into the stone. Valis, Cardell and Bragg...\nTEGAN: (WHISPER) They’re not names, they’re just patterns! Symbols!\nDOCTOR: (WHISPER) Yes. I’m afraid that confirms your diagnosis. Mr Bragg is quite, quite mad!\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 73\nDOCTOR WHO: 44. LABORATORY\nVALIS: You’ve had your memories restored?\nCARDELL: Yes. I know... I know who I am now. You understand what you must do?\nVALIS: Now that I’ve isolated the antigen sequence, it should be fairly straightforward to modify the virus to become more transmissible. But there's one thing —\nCARDELL: Yes?\nVALIS: I’1l need to test it on the others. The augmented virus could have unpredictable effects, its incubation period may differ.\nCARDELL: Very well. I’1ll bring them to you. You can start on the girl.\nVALIS: Okay, now Cardell’s gone. Tell me. How did you know about adapting the Cractid antigen?\nNYSSA: That’s why you asked for me?\nVALIS: You clearly know far more than you’re letting on. We’ve been working on this for months, only for you to walk in and come up with the answer in a couple of minutes!\nNYSSA: It’s because... I’ve been working on Richter’s syndrome too. And I’ve seen the consequences of your re-engineered virus being released!\nVALIS: So what your friends said is true? You really are from the future?\nNYSSA: It’s a long story. But the reason we’re here is to try to make sure that that future doesn’t happen!\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 74\nDOCTOR WHO: 45. MEDICAL BAY\nTURLOUGH: Doctor, Tegan! Did you find out anything?\nTEGAN: Oh, one or two things.\nDOCTOR: Bragg, you have to let us help you —\nEDGAR: Enforcement Officer Bragg to proceed to facility control room.\nBRAGG: Director Cardell, what are you — (doing here)\nCARDELL: You just run along to Edgar, Mr Bragg. I’ve come to collect the others. For experimentation.\nCARDELL: 46. LABORATORY\nEDGAR: Bio-technician Valis to proceed to facility control room.\nVALIS: Not now, Edgar.\nEDGAR: Priority one.\nVALIS: I’1l be down as soon as I can. Now stop bothering me.\nNYSSA: You’re not going?\nVALIS: No. You see, we’re completed our mission. Which means we get our memories back.\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 75\nNYSSA: Isn’t that good news? Finding out who you really are?\nVALIS: What if I don’t like the person I really am? I mean, I must’ve agreed to come here, to do this. Maybe I don’t want to be that person.\nNYSSA: But what about your memories of your family?\nVALIS: Maybe I’m better off not knowing? Being a blank slate. I know enough to know that everything I thought I knew is a lie.\nNYSSA: A lie?\nVALIS: I thought I was here to save lives. There, that’s done it.\nNYSSA: You've re-engineered the virus?\nVALIS: I said it would be straightforward.\nNYSSA: You can’t intend to go along with this?\nVALIS: I told you. Not my decision. (BEAT) And may Freya forgive me.\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 76\nDOCTOR WHO: 47. CONTROL ROOM\nBRAGG: Okay, Edgar, what is it?\nEDGAR: As the mission goal has been achieved, you may now access your memory lattice.\nBRAGG: No. No. I don’t want to [have my —]\nEDGAR: In event of resistance, I have the authority to over-rule your decision.\nBRAGG: Whose authority?\nEDGAR: Yours. Restoring.\nBRAGG: No, it’s a lie. There’s nothing, there is no past! (GASPS)\nEDGAR: There is a message included in your memory lattice. Message Signatory: Enforcement Officer Bragg.\nBRAGG: Go ahead.\nBRAGG: (RECORDING)\nBRAGG: You're hearing this because the mission has been successful, and you’ve had your memories returned. Now listen carefully. You are an agent working for the Independent Bio-Development Group. We need you to acquire for us a sample of the re- engineered virus and the antiviral solution. And whatever you do, they must not remain in the hands of the Company!\nBRAGG: (AMUSED) So it seems we did have a traitor in our midst. Me! (BEAT) Edgar, reconfigure access privileges. From now on you will obey only my instructions.\nEDGAR: Command accepted.\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 77\nDOCTOR WHO: 48. LABORATORY\nCARDELL: Inside, all of you.\nNYSSA: (SEEING THEM, DELIGHT) Doctor, Tegan — !\nDOCTOR: Nyssa, you haven’t been harmed?\nNYSSA: No, I'm fine —\nCARDELL: Bio-Technician Valis, any progress?\nVALIS: I’ve created an augmented viral strain. The sample contained in this phial is enough wipe out a planet.\nCARDELL: And the antiviral solution?\nVALIS: Prepared. In the second phial.\nCARDELL: You have commenced testing on the woman?\nVALIS: No. And I’m not going to.\nCARDELL: Those are the direct instructions of the Company!\nVALIS: I refuse to be complicit in economic mass-murder!\nCARDELL: Funny way to commit suicide, but it’s your choice. I’1l just have to perform the experiment myself. You can be first.\nVALIS: No!\nBRAGG: Oh no, I wouldn’t do that, if I were you, Director.\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 78\nCARDELL: Bragg, what are you doing? Put that gun down at once. That’s an order!\nBRAGG: I think you’ll find I’m the one giving the orders. Now. Give me the virus sample.\nTURLOUGH: (WHISPER) Doctor, Tegan — quick, behind the dissection table.\nTEGAN: (WHISPER) Why?\nTURLOUGH: (WHISPER) I’ve seen this all before!\nBRAGG: I said, give me the sample!\nVALIS: No. Once the Company have the formula, — (they will)\nBRAGG: I don’t work for the Company. Now, for the final time...\nCARDELL: You’re an independent? You know, I always thought there was something a bit wrong about you.\nBRAGG: I can see I’m going to have to prove my credentials.\nTURLOUGH: Now, Doctor, Tegan — run!\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris\nDOCTOR WHO: 49. CORRIDOR\nTEGAN: Page 79\nTEGAN: Doctor, he’s still got Turlough and Nyssa in there with him!\nDOCTOR: Yes, I am aware of that!\nTEGAN: What did Turlough mean, he’d seen it all before?\nDOCTOR: The telepathic projection, he’d experienced Valis’s memory.\nTEGAN: But hang on a minute. That doesn’t make sense.\nDOCTOR: Really? Why?\nEDGAR: Alert. Paradigm conflict. Multiple command protocols.\nEDGAR: System error detected. Paradigm conflict resolved.\nTEGAN: What’s got into Edgar?\nDOCTOR: Do you know, I think it might be an idea to find out!\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 80\nDOCTOR WHO: 50. LABORATORY\nNYSSA: Valis.. she’s not dead! Only stunned.\nBRAGG: Stay back, all of you. Now, the samples of the virus and cure?\nCARDELL: Here.\nBRAGG: No sudden movements. Gently. On the table.\nBRAGG: Thank you. My employers will be most grateful! One more thing. Director, if you could step into the isolation chamber?\nCARDELL: What? Why?\nBRAGG: Inside. Or the next time I shoot, it will be to kill.\nCARDELL: You’re mad.\nBRAGG: Oh no. I can assure you, I am, for the first time in a long while, utterly sane.\nTURLOUGH: What are you doing?\nBRAGG: Covering my tracks. So when the Company investigates, they’1l know exactly what happened. Or they’1l think they do.\nCARDELL: No! What are you doing! Let me out!\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 81\nVALIS: Bragg! If you release the Cractids into the chamber, she won’t stand a chance. They’1l rip her into shreds!\nNYSSA: (WHISPER) Turlough. This.. this is the memory I saw!\nTURLOUGH: (WHISPER) What?\nNYSSA: I experienced being attacked by the Cractids.. and now it’s happening, just as it did in the projection!\nVALIS: You have to stop this! It’s cold-blooded murder!\nBRAGG: The Cractids are merciless creatures. They’1ll strip the flesh from the bone, then devour the carcass, until nothing is left!\nBRAGG: (FX: A GRILLE OPENS. CRACTIDS STREAM OUT, AS IN SCENE 3. WE SHIFT TO CONTROL ROOM WHERE THIS SCENE IS BEING WATCHED)\nCARDELL: (VIA MONITOR) Bragg, let me out, you maniac! No! No. No! (SCREAMS)\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 82\nDOCTOR WHO: 51. CONTROL ROOM\nTEGAN: Can’t we do anything to stop this?\nDOCTOR: Edgar, shut down the power to the isolation chamber. Now!\nEDGAR: Unable to comply. Access privileges denied.\nDOCTOR: Edgar, if you don’t intervene, Cardell will die!\nEDGAR: Sequence of events results in death of crew member. Must avert death of crew member. Must ensure death of crew member —\nTEGAN: What do you think’s happened, to Edgar?\nDOCTOR: Something seems to have disrupted his logic circuits. Inducing a state of paranoid schizophrenia! Tegan. What was it you said that didn’t make sense?\nTEGAN: It doesn’t matter now.\nDOCTOR: Tell me!\nTEGAN: The memory records. We saw the final moments of each of the crew, right? Their last few seconds before they were killed?\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nTEGAN: So, if they were dead, how could they have uploaded their memories into the computer?\nDOCTOR: Of course, the memories were faked! Designed to make it look as though the crew had all been killed — when they hadn’t!\nTEGAN: So we don’t know for sure whether the crew will live or die?\nDOCTOR: No. It seems the future is all to play for!\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 83\nDOCTOR WHO: 52. LABORATORY\nCARDELL: (BANGING ON GLASS, MUFFLED) Let me out! Help me! Help!\nNYSSA: Turlough, we must do something!\nTURLOUGH: I thought the idea was that we shouldn’t interfere?\nNYSSA: We can’t just stand by and watch her be eaten!\nTURLOUGH: Then I recommend you avert your eyes!\nVALIS: Bragg, don’t do this, please.\nBRAGG: You'll give me your full co-operation?\nVALIS: Anything! Yes!\nNYSSA: What are you doing?\nVALIS: A sonic burst at the resonant frequency of the Cractids’ outer shells. Knocks them out for a few minutes!\nBRAGG: Out!\nCARDELL: What in the name of Skadi did you do that for?\nBRAGG: Edgar. Upload the most recent memories from Valis and Cardell.\nEDGAR: Uploading memory record... Memories uploaded.\nBRAGG: Good. Now edit — end Cardell memory at the point the Cractids attacked. End Valis memory at the point where she was shot. Oh, and obscure the identity of her attacker, of course!\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 84\nEDGAR: Memory files edited.\nVALIS: You’re deliberately editing the records to make it look like we were killed?\nBRAGG: When in fact, Bio-Technician Valis, you will be coming with me.\nVALIS: What? No.\nBRAGG: Your knowledge may still be useful... but as for the rest of you, well, I’m sure the Cractids will appreciate the protein!\nNYSSA: What did he mean?\nCARDELL: The isolation chamber door is still open. When the Cractids recover... they’1l stream out into the rest of the laboratory.\nTURLOUGH: Then we’ve got to shut it. Where are the controls?\nCARDELL: Here.\nTURLOUGH: It’s not responding!\nCARDELL: It won’t. Bragg has scrambled the security codes.\nNYSSA: Then we should leave.\nCARDELL: I’m afraid he’s thought of that too. We’re locked in.\nNYSSA: (VIA MONITOR, BACKGROUND DIALOGUE ONLY)\nNYSSA: Turlough... I think the Cractids are beginning to wake up!\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 85\nDOCTOR WHO: 53. CONTROL ROOM\nTEGAN: Doctor, can’t you get them out of there?\nDOCTOR: Edgar. Open the laboratory door!\nEDGAR: Unable to comply. All crew members must die!\nTEGAN: What? Why?\nEDGAR: Memory records indicate that the crew of this facility died on this date. Therefore, they shall, will, must die on this date!\nDOCTOR: (FRUSTRATION) Circular logic!\nTEGAN: Doctor, how come Edgar suddenly knows all about the future?\nDOCTOR: Don’t know. Somebody told him? Or maybe he overheard something?\nEDGAR: I remember. It happened before. As it will happen again. Pity me. Pity me!\nTEGAN: (REALISING) It remembers because it is the one from the future! It’s in there somewhere as well!\nDOCTOR: Yes! Two rival consciousnesses, fighting for supremacy in the same brain. Must be what caused it to lose its sanity.\nTEGAN: But how did the other Edgar get here? Did it hitch a ride in the TARDIS?\nLOKI: (GROAN, INCOHERENT GIBBERISH) Weak. Power source. Scanning.\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 86\nDOCTOR: Loki!\nTEGAN: Nyssa’s pet robot! What’s it’s doing here?\nDOCTOR: Its auditory functions have been destroyed, but if I can patch through to the cerebral matrix, using power from Edgar...\nTEGAN: You keep talking, I’1l just stand here and nod occasionally.\nDOCTOR: .with any luck, I should be able to get a residual output!\nLOKI: So dark. So dark. So lonely. Pity me. Pity poor Edgar. Pity me!\nTEGAN: That wasn’t Loki.\nDOCTOR: No. That was Edgar.\nTEGAN: Inside Loki’s head?\nDOCTOR: Edgar must have downloaded a copy of itself into Loki’s mind! Then, after Loki travelled back with us in the TARDTS...\nTEGAN: - it uploaded that copy of itself into the Edgar in the past!\nDOCTOR: The cause of its own madness. A self-perpetuating loop!\nTEGAN: Which is how the future Edgar knew we could travel in time!\nDOCTOR: Yes! But thanks to the logical paradox, this Edgar, rather than trying to avoid the deaths remembered by its future self, it is determined to make them come about...\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 87\nBRAGG: Move away from the computer, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Or you’1ll shoot me? The number of times I’ve heard that threat, it’s almost as if the universe has its own catchphrase.\nBRAGG: Oh, Doctor. What do you take me for? I’1l shoot your companion, then I’11 shoot Valis, and then I’11l shoot you.\nTEGAN: Don’t do it, Doctor, he can’t risk damaging the machine!\nDOCTOR: Why? What do you need Edgar for? You’ve got the virus, you’ve got the antiviral solution, so why are you still here?\nBRAGG: Edgar! Erase all memory records relating to Richter’s research.\nEDGAR: Are you sure you want to permanently delete? This process is\nEDGAR: irreversible.\nBRAGG: That’s why I asked you to do it, you fatuous machine. Delete!\nEDGAR: All memory records relating to research... deleted.\nBRAGG: Good. Now. Valis. Ask for your memory lattice.\nVALIS: No.\nBRAGG: Don’t make me tell you again.\nVALIS: (PINNED IN GRIP) Edgar. Release my memory lattice.\nVALIS: I — (SCREAMS) Bragg, no. That’s not yours!\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 88\nDOCTOR: Please. Be careful with that.\nBRAGG: So. To think, I have a lifetime of your memories in my hand. All contained in the one small, fragile crystal.\nVALIS: Please, put it down, it’s of no use to you.\nBRAGG: Every moment of your past. Every childhood summer, every hope, every heartbreak. Your entire history. I wonder who you really are —\nVALIS: No!!!\nTEGAN: I hope you’re pleased with yourself, Bragg.\nBRAGG: Very. I see our Cractid friends are becoming restless. When they’ve finished with you, there won’t be a single ounce of you left. (BEAT) Don’t try coming after us, Doctor. Or I will kill Valis.\nDOCTOR: Edgar. You have to let our friends out of the laboratory. Now!\nEDGAR: Unable to comply.\nDOCTOR: Very well, on your own head be it...\nTEGAN: What are you going to do?\nDOCTOR: What do I always do? Fiddle with wires until something lights\nDOCTOR: up!\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 89\nDOCTOR WHO: 54. LABORATORY\nTURLOUGH: It’s no good. They’re crawling out of the chamber.\nCARDELL: Edgar. Open the door! Please!\nNYSSA: It worked!\nTURLOUGH: So it seems! Let’s not hang around, shall we?\nCARDELL: Edgar, close the door after us. Close it! Close it!\nTURLOUGH: It seems to have changed its mind...\nDOCTOR: (VIA INTERCOM)\nDOCTOR: Turlough! Nyssa! Cardell! Get out of there! Run for your lives!\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 90\nDOCTOR WHO: 55. CONTROL ROOM\nTEGAN: You did it. You repaired the computer!\nDOCTOR: Oh no, I’m afraid we’re not out of the woods yet.\nTEGAN: What do you mean?\nDOCTOR: I had to fuse the circuit to get the laboratory door to open.\nTEGAN: So?\nDOCTOR: So I can’t close it again. In a few minutes, this whole base\nDOCTOR: will be swarming with Cractids!\nTEGAN: Then we should find Nyssa and Turlough and leave! Right now!\nDOCTOR: No. First we have to find Bragg... where is he?\nDOCTOR: (CHECKING READING) Approaching the main airlock. Come on!\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 91\nDOCTOR WHO: 56. AIRLOCK\nVALIS: You've just condemned everyone in the station to certain death.\nBRAGG: Then you should count yourself lucky you’re not amongst them —\nVALIS: Oh mercy of Freya — Cractids. They’1ll kill both of us!\nBRAGG: No. Just whichever one of us they get to first.\nVALIS: (SHOVED) What? Bragg! No.\nBRAGG: Pity. You would’ve been useful. Edgar, open airlock!\nEDGAR: Opening airlock.\nBRAGG: Now seal it! Quickly!\nVALIS: Bragg! Edgar! Open the airlock! Open the airlock! (SCREAMS)\nVALIS: (FX: CRACTIDS EATING VALIS ALIVE. CHOMP! CHOMP! WE MOVE TO THE\nOTHER: SIDE OF THE DOOR WHERE HER SCREAMS ARE MUFFLED)\nBRAGG: Edgar. Can you hear me? I want you to depressurize the airlock. Then repressurize it, before I lose consciousness.\nEDGAR: Pity me. Pity poor Edgar.\nBRAGG: Never mind that, just do it!\nEDGAR: Airlock depressurizing.\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 92\nDOCTOR WHO: 57. BASE CORRIDOR\nDOCTOR: Come on, Tegan. Keep up!\nTEGAN: I don’t get it, why don’t we just go-?\nNYSSA: Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Nyssa, Turlough, Cardell! No time to explain, we have to try to reach the airlock, stop Bragg taking off —\nTURLOUGH: That airlock being the one on the upper level?\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nNYSSA: You can’t go up there, that’s where those creatures are!\nDOCTOR: They must have picked up Bragg’s scent!\nTEGAN: Then we should take the lift down to the crew quarters. Get back to the TARDIS while we still can!\nCARDELL: Your transmat capsule? Good luck with that. I’1l be in the control room, trying to talk some sense into Edgar.\nDOCTOR: Cardell, there’s nothing [you can do —]\nCARDELL: He might listen to me. I have to try.\nTEGAN: Well, Doctor? Time we got out of here!\nDOCTOR: You don’t understand, Tegan.\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 93\nNYSSA: If Bragg leaves now, the virus will be released thirty years early, and the whole course of history will be changed!\nTURLOUGH: Well, whatever you decide, I suggest we move. Look!\nNYSSA: Oh no. Cractids.. they’ve broken into the access shafts.\nTURLOUGH: How can they reproduce so quickly?\nTEGAN: Does it really matter? They’re between us and the TARDIS!\nDOCTOR: Yes. So now there’s only one place left for us to run...\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 94\nDOCTOR WHO: 58. SUPPLY SHIP\nBRAGG: Right. Edgar. Upload my memory, last thirty seconds.\nEDGAR: Uploading memory record... Memory uploaded.\nBRAGG: Now end it at a point one second before the airlock began to re-pressurize.\nEDGAR: Memory file edited.\nBRAGG: Something else. If, at any point in the future, anyone visits this research station, you play back the most recent memories.\nEDGAR: Command accepted.\nBRAGG: One last thing. Begin broadcast, warning signal. ‘This is Helheim gene-tech facility. We are in a state of emergency quarantine. Do not attempt to land.’\nEDGAR: Message recorded. Beginning transmission.\nBRAGG: Keep transmitting. No matter what. Right. Now. Ship computer? Commence launch.\nSHIP: COMPUTER Fuel reserves insufficient.\nBRAGG: What?\nSHIP: COMPUTER Fuel reserves insufficient.\nBRAGG: I don’t believe it! Computer, transfer power from the base’s solar stacks. They won’t be needing it any more!\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris\nDOCTOR WHO: 59. CONTROL ROOM\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: DOOR OPENS. EDGAR NOW EXTREMELY GLITCHY. POWER DRAIN\nDOCTOR WHO: ALL THE EQUIPMENT DROPS IN PITCH, LIGHTS FLICKER)\nCARDELL: Edgar. What’s happening?\nEDGAR: The solar stacks are being drained by the supply ship.\nCARDELL: What? Edgar. Cut the power feed!\nEDGAR: Access privileges denied.\nCARDELL: What? (REALISING) Bragg!\nEDGAR: Alert. Cractid organisms approaching facility control room.\nCARDELL: Fantastic. Now I’m trapped in here.\nCARDELL: 60. BASE CORRIDOR\nTEGAN: There’s more of those things, there must be hundreds of them!\nDOCTOR: Come on, nearly there —\nTURLOUGH: (REALISING WHERE THEY ARE) Oh no! Not here.\nNYSSA: The medical bay!\nTEGAN: Hey, what happened to the lights?\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 96\nDOCTOR: Never mind that — quick, inside, all of you!\nDOCTOR: Everyone in? Right!\nTEGAN: Great. So we’re locked in. Now what do we do?\nTURLOUGH: We wait. To die.\nDOCTOR: Ever the optimist, Turlough.\nTURLOUGH: Don’t you see, Doctor? This is how we ended up in the medical bay. Sealed from the inside! Four skeletons!\nTEGAN: We can’t be sure, we might escape.\nNYSSA: With those things outside? If we open that door, we'd be eaten within a matter of seconds.\nTEGAN: You mean we stay here until we starve to death?\nTURLOUGH: Or until the oxygen runs out.\nTEGAN: Doctor. Tell me it’s not true.\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry, Tegan. We’ve seen the future. This is how it ends!\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 97"

Four skeletons!\nTEGAN: We can’t be sure, we might escape.\nNYSSA: With those things outside? If we open that door, we’d be dead within a matter of seconds.\nTEGAN: You mean we stay here, until we starve to death?\nTURLOUGH: Or until the oxygen runs out.\nTEGAN: Doctor. Tell me it’s not true.\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry, Tegan. We’ve seen the future. This is how it ends!\nNYSSA: Our lives aren’t significant. All that matters is that we stop Bragg from leaving with a sample of the augmented virus.\nTEGAN: How do you propose we do that? We’re trapped here, in case you hadn’t noticed!\nNYSSA: I don’t know, Tegan, but arguing amongst ourselves is not going to help!\nTURLOUGH: I wonder if Cardell made it to the control room.\nTEGAN: You and your morbid curiosity, Turlough. Pulled the legs off any spiders lately?\nTURLOUGH: I was asking, because if she did, she might be in a position to help us!\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 98\nDOCTOR: Quiet, everyone! Cardell. Can you hear me?\nCARDELL: (VIA INTERCOM)\nCARDELL: I hear you, Doctor, but I’m afraid I’m as stuck as you are. The Cractids are currently trying to chew through the door!\nDOCTOR: And Edgar?\nCARDELL: (VIA INTERCOM)\nCARDELL: Bragg’s revoked my access privileges, it’s refusing to obey any commands. It’s having some sort of mental breakdown.\nTEGAN: So no chance you could get it to put the lights back on?\nCARDELL: It’s not as simple as that. The power outage is due to Bragg diverting the output of the solar stacks to the supply ship.\nNYSSA: (VIA INTERCOM) So he hasn’t left yet?\nCARDELL: (VIA INTERCOM)\nCARDELL: Not yet, but it’s only a matter of time. Give me a minute, I might be able to manually cut the power feed.\nNYSSA: Doctor, what do you think has happened to Edgar?\nTEGAN: When we were in the future, it placed a copy of its mind into Loki.\nDOCTOR: Who then brought it back to this time, whereupon Edgar uploaded its mind into its earlier self. Two Edgars in one! And, as the Edgar from the future attempts to convince its earlier self that everyone in the base is going to die —\nTURLOUGH: - its former self is convinced to make that eventuality come about!\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 99\nTEGAN: But what good does this do? Neither of them is in a mind to help!\nNYSSA: No. But someone else might be. (LOUD) Loki!\nNYSSA: (FX: EDGAR RESPONDS, BUT ALTERNATING WORDS AND SYLLABLES WITH LOKI.

Tegan mentioned it earlier — when we visited here in the future there wasn’t a second TARDIS!\nTEGAN: So?\nDOCTOR: So if we do die here, it’s not like this. At least, not yet!\nTURLOUGH: The Cractids are becoming restless.\nTEGAN: They can tell we’re in here, that’s why. Lunch!\nTURLOUGH: Nyssa, what’s the atmosphere of this planet like?\nTEGAN: Oh great, now he wants to discuss the weather!\nTURLOUGH: Nyssa?\nNYSSA: Highly toxic, predominantly sulphur and carbon oxides. Why?\nTURLOUGH: What density is it? Is it a lower pressure than in here?\nNYSSA: Yes, but —\nTURLOUGH: Don’t you see? If we open the airlock, the differential would cause the atmosphere in the base to rush out!\nTEGAN: Oh, I get it! Flushing out the Cractids at the same time!\nDOCTOR: Do you know, that might actually work!\nNYSSA: There is another, less drastic option.\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 102\nDOCTOR: Nyssa?\nNYSSA: When we were in the laboratory, Bragg used a sonic burst to\nNYSSA: stun the Cractids. Loki should be able to repeat the effect.\nDOCTOR: Well, in that case, what are we waiting for?\nNYSSA: Loki. You know what you must do?\nEDGAR AND LOKI: Commencing sonic burst.\nEDGAR AND LOKI: 64.

These are creatures of pure instinct. They don’t deserve our cruelty!\nTEGAN: I don’t know, I’d feel a lot happier if those things were put\nTEGAN: out of action on a permanent basis.\nDOCTOR: And I’m sure they’d say the same about you, Tegan. Come on!\nTEGAN: Where you we going?\nDOCTOR: While the Cractids are out cold, we have to locate Mr Bragg...\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 104\nDOCTOR WHO: 66.

Reconfigure access privileges.\nEDGAR AND LOKI: I am not Edgar. I am Loki.\nBRAGG: Who are you? Who are you?\nEDGAR: I am.. I am Edgar. Pity me! Pit-pit-pit-pit-pit-pit-pity me.\nBRAGG: Better. Edgar. Delete all elements of rogue ‘Loki’ personality.\nEDGAR: Loki personality... all elements and memory records. Deleted.\nBRAGG: So much simpler that way. Now command the maintenance spiders to reconnect the power to the supply ship.\nEDGAR: Commencing repair. Estimated time to completion. Three minutes.\nBRAGG: As soon as the link is re-established, divert all power from the stacks to the ship.\nBRAGG: The Doctor! Delighted you could make it.\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 105\nDOCTOR: The pleasure is all yours, I assure you.\nBRAGG: And your three friends. What a pity you survived the Cractids. Still, an oversight easily corrected — (SUDDENLY HIT)\nDOCTOR: Cardell!\nCARDELL: Quick, pass me his gun, before he wakes up.\nDOCTOR: That uppercut was worthy of Gentleman Jim himself.\nNYSSA: What about the viral solutions?\nCARDELL: He doesn’t have them on him, surprise. He must have left them back on the supply ship.\nDOCTOR: Nyssa, Tegan, go with Cardell, help her find them.\nTEGAN: While you do what?\nDOCTOR: I have a few questions to put to Mr Bragg. Turlough, watch him in case he tries anything.\nTURLOUGH: Another power drain. He must have found a way of over-riding Loki’s instructions.\nNYSSA: Loki, I want you to —\nEDGAR: I am not Loki. I am Edgar. Everyone will, shall, must die!\nNYSSA: Loki, what happened to him? Where did he go?\nCARDELL: Deleted by Bragg. Now, are you coming with me or not?\nTEGAN: Alright, no need to be so sympathetic!\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 106\nDOCTOR WHO: 67. SUPPLY SHIP\nTEGAN: Those Cractid things, by the airlock. How can you be sure\nTEGAN: they’re not going to wake up while we’re in here?\nCARDELL: I can’t. So I suggest you help us search before they do.\nNYSSA: Cryogenic suspension unit — here! I’ve found them.\nCARDELL: Hand them over.\nNYSSA: What?\nCARDELL: Those phials are the property of the Company.\nNYSSA: But if the virus escapes, whole worlds will — (be enslaved)\nCARDELL: Either give them to me now, or I’11 shoot you and take the phials off your smoking corpse.\nTEGAN: There is a third option.\nSHIP: COMPUTER Firing aft engines.\nCARDELL: You idiot, what are you trying to do, get us all killed?\nTEGAN: Nyssa, throw them over to me!\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 107\nCARDELL: Give it back. Give it back!\nNYSSA: No, Tegan. Run! Save yourself.\nCARDELL: Stop!\nTEGAN: You want it? You come and get it!\nCARDELL: Where does she think she can go? (BEAT) Nyssa, give me the\nCARDELL: other solution. Well?\nNYSSA: I don’t have it, it slipped out of my hands!\nCARDELL: What? Then — (DISCOVERS IT) Oh no. The phial that contained the virus.\nNYSSA: What do you mean, ‘contained’?\nCARDELL: It’s shattered. Shattered! Do you realise what you’ve done?\nNYSSA: The virus has escaped into the air. Cardell. We have to seal the airlock!\nCARDELL: What?\nNYSSA: We have to stop it spreading into the base!\nCARDELL: (BITTER LAUGH) It’s too late. It will have entered the base’s atmospheric conditioning. We’re infected — and in a matter of minutes, so will everybody else!\nNYSSA: Then we have to warn them, at least!\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 108\nDOCTOR WHO: 68. CONTROL ROOM\nDOCTOR: (VIA INTERCOM) Nyssa! Are you alright? Did you find the phials?\nNYSSA: (VIA INTERCOM)\nNYSSA: Doctor, the phial containing the Richter’s virus was broken.\nBRAGG: (LAUGHS BITTERLY) Varsak spits in our faces!\nTURLOUGH: We have to seal the airlock!\nDOCTOR: No point. We’re breathing in contaminated air as we speak.\nEDGAR: All crew members must die. Must die. Must die. Must-—must-must! Must die!\nDOCTOR: Nyssa, what about the antiviral solution?\nNYSSA: (VIA INTERCOM)\nNYSSA: Tegan has it, she’s in the station somewhere. Doctor, Director Cardell, she wants the — (virus for herself) (MUFFLED)\nBRAGG: You’d better hope your companion turns up with the cure soon.\nTURLOUGH: You find this amusing?\nBRAGG: Oh come on, it’s hilarious. We all die together!\nDOCTOR: How long do we have? Bragg! You were sent here to recover this virus, you must know about it. How long?\nBRAGG: The course of infection is rapid, even for the normal form of the disease. First symptoms; cramps, fatigue, fever. Followed by excruciating agony. They say it’s like being boiled alive. Followed by an uncontrollable, primal fury. (BEAT) We’1ll all\nBRAGG: be tearing each other’s throats out!\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 109\nTURLOUGH: And death?\nBRAGG: After a month, or two if you’re unlucky. But the strain that’s bubbling through our bloodstreams has been re-engineered — for all we know, we might have only a few hours left! (LAUGHS)\nTEGAN: (VIA INTERCOM)\nTEGAN: Doctor! Doctor!\nDOCTOR: (VIA INTERCOM)\nDOCTOR: Tegan! Wherever you are, listen to me! The virus has escaped into the atmosphere!\nTEGAN: Just when I thought my day couldn’t get any better.\nEDGAR: It’s happening again, just as before! Everyone in the base will die. Because of Edgar. Because of me! (WEEPING)\nDOCTOR: Nyssa said you have the antivirus. Is that right?\nTEGAN: (VIA INTERCOM) Yes, yes, I’ve still got it.\nDOCTOR: I want you to go to the medical bay. Turlough and I will meet you there.\nEDGAR: Everyone must die. No. Undo. Cannot undo! Paradigm conflict!\nDOCTOR: Come on, Turlough, Mr Bragg, no time to lose!\nDOCTOR: (FX: BUTTONS PRESSED. DOOR OPENS. WE HEAR CRACTIDS AS WE MOVE INTO THE CORRIDOR. )\nBRAGG: The Cractids.. they’re not going to stay knocked out forever.\nDOCTOR: Then I suggest you try not to step on any of them. This way!\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 110\nTURLOUGH: Doctor — watch out!\nEDGAR: Cause of database error — Enforcement Officer Bragg. Station computer subject of sabotage. All personnel now denied access to control room.\nTURLOUGH: Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Yes. It seems that Edgar’s had enough of being tampered with!\nDOCTOR: 70. SUPPLY SHIP\nNYSSA: We’re not going to do any good staying here. We must find Tegan!\nCARDELL: Alright, I — (BREATHING, MOMENTARY AGONY) Aaaaah.\nNYSSA: What’s the matter?\nCARDELL: My legs, pins and needles, cramp. I can’t — can’t move.\nNYSSA: I’1ll support you, here, put your arm around my shoulders.\nCARDELL: You’re willing to help me?\nNYSSA: I have no desire to see you suffer. Recriminations can wait.\nCARDELL: (GASPS) The first stage.. Quicker than usual. The Company... all their fault. You know, when I didn’t know, when I thought we were working to save lives, I wish I still was that person.\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 111\nNYSSA: You should save your strength.\nCARDELL: You've really seen what’s going to happen? The virus escapes?\nNYSSA: Yes. The first cases will be in about thirty years or so.\nCARDELL: (GASPS, WEAKENING) Leave me here, I’1ll just slow you down.\nNYSSA: No, I won’t...\nCARDELL: Think about it. Logic. You come back when you have the cure.\nNYSSA: I’m not leaving you.\nCARDELL: Go. Now. Or I’1l shoot you.\nNYSSA: When you put it like that.. I’11 be back as soon as I can.\nCARDELL: Oh, vengeance of Skadi, I can feel it starting... oh, Freya!\nCARDELL: 71. MEDICAL BAY\nTEGAN: (IN PAIN) Hurry up, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Going as fast as I can! I’ve modified the antiviral effect to work irrespective of blood or gene type. Hold still!\nTEGAN: Ow! You could’ve warned me that it would hurt!\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 112\nDOCTOR: That’s why I didn’t. Your turn, Turlough, sleeve up!\nTURLOUGH: Doctor, you do realise that I’m not —\nDOCTOR: Now, Turlough, if you could do the honours for me — (INJECTED) Ow. You were right, Tegan, it does hurt.\nTEGAN: Nyssa! Thank God you’re here! The Doctor’s prepared the cure.\nNYSSA: Then we must get it to Cardell, I don’t know how long she has left!\nDOCTOR: Your injection first. Nyssa.\nDOCTOR: And last but not least, Mr Bragg.\nBRAGG: (BEGINNING TO WEAKEN, DELIRIOUS) No. I have my orders!\nDOCTOR: Orders? And do they include getting yourself killed?\nBRAGG: You don’t understand. I have to deliver a sample of the virus.\nNYSSA: But the solution is lost, the phial was shattered.\nBRAGG: I am the sample. The virus is currently coursing through my blood stream. That’s why I can’t allow you to cure me...\nTEGAN: Ow! Get off me! (STRUGGLING)\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 113\nBRAGG: I wouldn’t get too close. Side-effect of infection — no telling what I might do. Now, Doctor, hand over the hypodermic!\nDOCTOR: Bragg, you need medical help. If you — (don’t get)\nBRAGG: (SHOUTS) Edgar! The virus has escaped into the station’s atmosphere. Initiate emergency decontamination procedure!\nEDGAR: Countdown to decontamination begins. Five minutes and\nEDGAR: counting.\nTURLOUGH: The self-destruct!\nNYSSA: Just as before.\nBRAGG: Don’t even think about coming after me.\nTEGAN: (DRAGGED OUT) Let me go!\nDOCTOR: Nyssa, Turlough. Reason with Edgar, try to delay the\nDOCTOR: countdown.\nNYSSA: What about you?\nDOCTOR: I’m going after Tegan. And if I don’t come back...\nTURLOUGH: Yes?\nDOCTOR: Be nice to each other!\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 114\nDOCTOR WHO: 72. CORRIDOR\nTEGAN: Those Cractids things — they’re waking up! I saw one move!\nBRAGG: Then I recommend you don’t waste time by struggling!\nTEGAN: What you’re doing is insane. Sacrificing your own life, and for what? So that some businessman can turn a profit?\nBRAGG: No. I have the cure and I fully intend to use it. But first we have to get out of here!\nCARDELL: (CONTROLLING GREAT PAIN) Bragg. So glad you could make it.\nBRAGG: Cardell, what do you think you’re doing?\nCARDELL: What does it look like? I’m getting ready to meet the Gods!\nCARDELL: 73. MEDICAL BAY\nNYSSA: Turlough, the Cractids — they’re stirring!\nTURLOUGH: Yes. And now that Edgar’s refusing to follow orders, we can’t use another sonic burst to knock them out.\nEDGAR: Countdown continuing. Four minutes.\nNYSSA: Edgar. If you don’t call off the quarantine procedure, you will be responsible for the deaths of everybody in this station!\nEDGAR: Too late. Infection has escaped. Facility compromised. Everyone must die! Everyone must die!\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 115\nDOCTOR WHO: 74. AIRLOCK\nBRAGG: You don’t have to do this, Cardell. You can come with me. There’s enough of the antiviral for both of us!\nCARDELL: Oh no. If you take one step closer it’1l be the last move you ever make.\nTEGAN: (WHISPER) Doctor!\nDOCTOR: (WHISPER) Tegan, shhh!\nTEGAN: (WHISPER) Doctor, she’s up to something!\nCARDELL: (GASP OF PAIN) Not long to go. If I were you, Bragg, I’d start offering up prayers to the Gods of Hell.\nBRAGG: What do you mean?\nCARDELL: The boy’s idea. I’ve rigged the airlock mechanism, so the inner door cannot shut. All I have to do is blast a hole in the outer wall and —\nBRAGG: We’d all be sucked out onto the planet’s surface!\nCARDELL: And the virus, and the cure, will be destroyed along with us.\nTEGAN: (WHISPER) I don’t think she’s bluffing!\nDOCTOR: (WHISPER) Quickly, Tegan, over here, while Bragg’s distracted.\nTEGAN: What’s the plan?\nDOCTOR: The spacesuits! They’re our only chance...\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 116\nDOCTOR WHO: 75. MEDICAL BAY\nNYSSA: Edgar. You know we’re from the future. You remember that?\nEDGAR: I remember.\nNYSSA: And that we had a time machine?\nEDGAR: I remember.\nNYSSA: Well, we could hardly have travelled back from the future, if you had destroyed the base now, could we?\nEDGAR: Logic correct. Analysis of memory records corresponds.\nTURLOUGH: So if you want to undo what’s happened, call off the countdown!\nEDGAR: Unable to cancel emergency quarantine procedure.\nNYSSA: You don’t have to cancel it. Just delay it, until we return!\nTURLOUGH: Just as you remember doing, before!\nEDGAR: Postponing quarantine procedure. Standing-by.\nEDGAR: (FX: WARNING ALARM SOUND IS SWITCHED OFF. VIA THE MONITOR, WE\nMOVE: BACK TO AIRLOCK)\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 117\nDOCTOR WHO: 76. AIRLOCK\nBRAGG: (VIA MONITOR)\nBRAGG: It’s still not too late. We can still get out of this alive.\nCARDELL: No. I think... I think that death is all we deserve.\nDOCTOR: Hurry, Tegan — put on the helmet —\nTEGAN: I’m trying! It’s fiddly.\nDOCTOR: Try turning it the other way. There’s a [groove —]\nTEGAN: Doctor, look out! The Cractids — !\nTEGAN: 77. MEDICAL BAY\nNYSSA: Turlough. If Cardell punches a hole in the outer wall —\nTURLOUGH: Yes. I think perhaps it might be an idea to seal the doors...\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 118\nDOCTOR WHO: 78. AIRLOCK\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: CRACTIDS SCUTTLING EVERYWHERE. DOCTOR AND TEGAN STILL\nSTRUGGLING: INTO THEIR SPACESUITS. )\nTEGAN: (VIA MONITOR) Doctor, I still don’t think my helmet’s on right —\nDOCTOR: It’ll have to do. Find something secure to hold on to!\nBRAGG: Cardell! You’re committing suicide!\nCARDELL: But at least I’1ll have the satisfaction of knowing that I took you with me!\nCARDELL: (FX: CARDELL SHOOTS THE WALL. THERE’S A SUDDEN DEAFENING,\nROARING: RUSH OF AIR)\nROARING: 79. MEDICAL BAY\nNYSSA: Cardell did it. She blew open the airlock. She killed herself.\nTURLOUGH: What about the others?\nNYSSA: I don’t know, I can’t make anything out...\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 119\nDOCTOR WHO: 80. ATRLOCK\nTEGAN: (WEARING HELMET)\nTEGAN: Doctor. Can’t hold on. The wind’s too strong!\nDOCTOR: (WEARING HELMET)\nDOCTOR: Just a few seconds. Take my hand!\nTEGAN: (WEARING HELMET) (SCREAMS) The Cractids — they’re being sucked outside as well!\nDOCTOR: (WEARING HELMET)\nDOCTOR: Keep flat against the wall. Brave heart, Tegan!\nTEGAN: (WEARING HELMET)\nTEGAN: It’s not my heart I’m worried about!\nDOCTOR: (WEARING HELMET)\nDOCTOR: That should be all of them. The pressure should even out soon.\nTEGAN: (WEARING HELMET) Doctor, what about Bragg? I didn’t see what happened to Bragg!\nTEGAN: 81. SUPPLY SHIP\nBRAGG: Computer. Check. Sufficient power for take off?\nSHIP: COMPUTER Fuel reserves sufficient.\nBRAGG: Then... commence automatic launch.\nSHIP: COMPUTER Commencing launch.\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 120\nDOCTOR WHO: 82. ATRLOCK\nTEGAN: (WEARING HELMET) Doctor. The supply ship. The engines have ignited!\nDOCTOR: (WEARING HELMET)\nDOCTOR: Yes. Bragg must have made it.\nTEGAN: (WEARING HELMET) But if we’re still standing here when that thing blasts off...!\nDOCTOR: (WEARING HELMET) Quickly, inside! Just have to — yes — (EFFORT) Manually close\nDOCTOR: the inner doors.\nDOCTOR: (FX: AIRLOCK CLOSES WITH A CLANG. WHICH MUFFLES THE RUMBLE OF\nENGINES: WHICH GIVE A GROUND-SHAKING BOOM AS THE SHIP TAKES OFF)\nTEGAN: (WEARING HELMET) He’s taken off! So Cardell died for nothing.\nDOCTOR: (WEARING HELMET)\nDOCTOR: No, not for nothing. I think she finally realised who she really was.\nTEGAN: (WEARING HELMET)\nTEGAN: This whole place, it’s a wreck!\nDOCTOR: (WEARING HELMET)\nDOCTOR: Yes. But the maintenance spiders will fix it eventually — look, they’ve already started. Remember, when we arrived here?\nTEGAN: (WEARING HELMET)\nTEGAN: Yes. The whole place was covered in cobwebs...\nDOCTOR: (WEARING HELMET) All part of the automatic damage repair — (PENNY DROPS)\nDOCTOR: Cobwebs! The cobwebs! Of course!\nTEGAN: (WEARING HELMET) What?\nDOCTOR: (WEARING HELMET)\nDOCTOR: It’s been staring us in the face all along!\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 121\nDOCTOR WHO: 83. SUPPLY SHIP\nSHIP: COMPUTER Supply ship now free of Helheim gravity well.\nBRAGG: Made it. Made it! (LAUGHS) Computer, what’s the fuel situation?\nSHIP: COMPUTER Fuel reserves low.\nBRAGG: Enough to achieve warp?\nSHIP: COMPUTER Fuel reserves insufficient.\nBRAGG: (IN PAIN) Okay. Computer. Activate cryogenic suspension.\nSHIP: COMPUTER Activating cryogenic suspension. Ambient temperature dropping. Thirty degrees. Twenty degrees. Ten. Zero. Minus ten —\nSHIP: 84. CONSOLE ROOM\nTEGAN: (WEARING HELMET) Can I take this thing off now?\nDOCTOR: (WEARING HELMET)\nDOCTOR: Yes, it’s quite safe.\nTEGAN: Now are you going to tell me?\nDOCTOR: Hmmm? Tell you what?\nTEGAN: The significance of the cobwebs.\nDOCTOR: Better than that, Tegan. I’1ll show you.\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 122\nDOCTOR WHO: 85. MEDICAL BAY\nNYSSA: No sign of the Cractids. The whole station has been swept clean. It’s exactly as we found it.\nTURLOUGH: With one difference.\nNYSSA: One?\nTURLOUGH: Four beds. Four skeletons.\nNYSSA: Doctor! You made it!\nDOCTOR: Did you ever imagine I wouldn’t?\nTEGAN: Now can we get out of here?\nDOCTOR: Yes, Tegan.\nTURLOUGH: Er, Doctor. Something you’ve overlooked. The small matter of the skeletons?\nDOCTOR: Oh, yes. One thing left to do. Edgar!\nEDGAR: I have failed. The crew are dead. I allowed them to die.\nDOCTOR: You’re aware that we are time travellers?\nEDGAR: In your blue box.\nDOCTOR: Well, I have a promise for you. One day, we will come back. And when we do, you will be given a chance to prevent what happened here today.\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 123\nEDGAR: You promise?\nDOCTOR: We promise. When the four of us return... you shall be released from the endless unrelenting agony of existence! Goodbye, Edgar. Until next time! (BEAT) Now — into the TARDIS!\nTEGAN: But I still don’t see — what about our ‘destiny’?\nDOCTOR: Inside!\nEDGAR: No, Doctor. Don’t leave me alone in the darkness. Have pity on poor Edgar! Have pity on me! Don’t leave me alone! Come back to Edgar! Come back!\nEDGAR: 86. CONSOLE ROOM\nTURLOUGH: I thought we were supposed to die here?\nDOCTOR: Not quite. Watch.\nTEGAN: what are you doing?\nDOCTOR: I’m programming the TARDIS to drift forward in time, at a rate of one day per second. Now, watch the scanner!\nTEGAN: It’s just an empty room, nothing’s happening.\nDOCTOR: It will. Look.\nNYSSA: Maintenance spiders!\nTURLOUGH: They must have crawled in through the ventilation ducts.\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 124\nTEGAN: What are they doing? Just scuttling about?\nDOCTOR: More than that! Remember, when we discovered the skeletons they were covered in cobwebs. But we never thought to ask why.\nTEGAN: Why? Because the maintenance spiders were trying to repair the dead bodies, bring them back to life?\nDOCTOR: Think! Edgar believes that when the four of us return to this base, it’ll be able to travel back in time and make amends.\nTEGAN: So?\nDOCTOR: So, with ruthless computer logic, it’s decided that if it can’t wait for us to return, it will have to make us.\nTEGAN: What? How? It can’t make us come back, can it?\nDOCTOR: Oh, no. It can.\nNYSSA: The repair spiders! Edgar is trying to rebuild the four of us! Look. They’re fabricating copies of our clothes!\nTURLOUGH: But what about the bodies?\nDOCTOR: Based on DNA traces left behind in discarded skin, it’s trying to reconstruct us from scratch.\nTEGAN: (REALISING) From the inside out! Starting with the bones!\nNYSSA: It’s growing dark.\nDOCTOR: Edgar is running out of power. Bragg nearly exhausted the solar stacks, remember?\nTURLOUGH: The maintenance spiders are barely moving now.\nDOCTOR: That’s why there were only skeletons — because the spiders ran out of energy before they could finish the job.\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 125\nNYSSA: Like the other unfinished repairs we saw, coated with cobwebs!\nDOCTOR: Precisely!\nTEGAN: I can barely tell if anything’s still happening...\nDOCTOR: No power left. Edgar’s placed himself in hibernation. I think it’s time we left him to his rest, don’t you?\nNYSSA: Poor Edgar. All he ever wanted was a second chance.\nDOCTOR: Yes... which reminds me...\nTURLOUGH: What are you doing?\nDOCTOR: Yes! There it is, right on cue!\nNYSSA: The TARDIS?\nDOCTOR: Something — or somebody — dragged us down to this planet...\nTEGAN: It was you? You were the one who pulled the TARDIS off course?\nDOCTOR: Well, if I don’t, who else? (BEAT) Hold on, might be —\nTEGAN: The Doctor’s driving! He can’t even land without crashing into himself! Nyssa, I bet you haven’t missed this!\nNYSSA: Now, Doctor, take me back.\nDOCTOR: Back?\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 126\nNYSSA: I came to Helheim to locate a cure for Richter’s syndrome. Now you must return me to one of the affected worlds.\nTEGAN: But the solution — you gave it to Bragg, it was lost.\nNYSSA: You don’t think I’d give him all of it, do you? I kept a sample for myself. Enough to synthesize more of the antiviral.\nDOCTOR: You don’t want to travel with us?\nNYSSA: I am tempted — but no, Doctor. I’m needed.\nDOCTOR: Very well.\nTEGAN: Though knowing what the TARDIS is like, it could be months before he gets you home!\nNYSSA: (LAUGHS) Very true. Is my old bedroom still free?\nTEGAN: I’1l come with you, you might want to get settled in for a long stay...\nDOCTOR: Don’t listen to them, old girl. Nothing wrong with the scenic route. As I said to Christopher Columbus, there’s more to travelling than getting from A to B.\nTURLOUGH: I thought I was the one going home? And besides, Doctor, there is one other thing you’ve overlooked.\nDOCTOR: Quite probably, Turlough, I’ve had a rather busy day.\nTURLOUGH: Bragg. What happened to him? He was still infected.\nDOCTOR: Yes. But without enough fuel to leave the system. His ship will drift through space until it’s picked up by a passing vessel...\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 127\nDOCTOR WHO: 87. HOSPITAL\nSHIP: COMPUTER Reviving Enforcement Officer Bragg from cryogenic suspension.\nBRAGG: (WOOZY) Where... where am I? Who are you?\nHAWKS: Company Officiator Hawks. You’ve been asleep a long time.\nBRAGG: How long?\nHAWKS: Thirty years. We found you lost in interstellar space. Brought you back with us.\nBRAGG: Back with you? Where am I?\nHAWKS: Gondul Prime. We’ve just landed.\nBRAGG: But the infection... you’ve placed me in quarantine?\nHAWKS: What? No, we — (haven’t)\nBRAGG: I’m infected with Richter’s! Anyone who comes into contact with me will be contaminated!\nHAWKS: (REALISING) A plague ship!\nBRAGG: You’ve got to seal off the whole area immediately!\nHAWKS: You don’t understand. The crew has already disembarked. You... (BEAT) Got to get out of here. Get a flight to another system. Only chance.\nDOCTOR WHO: COBWEBS by Jonathan Morris Page 128\nBRAGG: You don’t understand. It’s too late. There’s nowhere you can run. (SCREAMS IN PAIN) You’re dead... every one of you! You’re all dead! You’re all dead!\nBRAGG: THE END"
