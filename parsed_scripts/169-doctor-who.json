What year is this?\nYOUNG MEL: I must have hit you harder than I thought! 1987.\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: (TO SELF) Am I too early..?\nYOUNG MEL: No, we've been here since quarter to eight. Mr Petherbridge is still in the hall if you want to see him.\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: Mr Petherbridge?\nYOUNG MEL: Head of the Dramatic Society. And the Heritage Society. And the Village Association. (BEAT) Is it ‘Joseph’?\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: (CONFUSED) No. I am known as the Doctor...\nYOUNG MEL: I mean the ‘coat of many colours’? You’re here to audition aren’t you? Sorry, I’ve got to get to work. If you’re sure you’re OK...\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: Yes, yes. I should probably make a note of your place of employment should any... complications arise.\nYOUNG MEL: I’m at the radar station. The ATC, up by the school. Sorry, it’s nearly nine...\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: Of course. You seem a very trustworthy young lady. I’1l be in touch should I require your... assistance.\nYOUNG MEL: (GETTING BACK ON BIKE) Good luck with the technicolour dreamcoat. You could try Brighton. They’1ll be casting their summer seasons. Bye! (FX: MEL CYCLES OFF)\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: How serendipitous. Perhaps now is the time I’m supposed to meet Mel the younger? Pease Pottage radar station. As good a place as any to hone her burgeoning computer skills.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 14\nDOCTOR WHO: There’s just the small matter of the prehistoric talon in this wreckage. Wreckage which Mel spectacularly failed to notice. How peculiar.\nWILBERFORCE: Can I help you? Mister..?\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: Good morning Madam. I was just considering alerting the authorities. There are this poor fellow’s earthly remains to dispose of.\nWILBERFORCE: I suppose you think you’re very modern, don’t you? Spouting this nonsense?\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: I’m sorry?\nWILBERFORCE: It might work for auditions up in that there London. But it cuts no ice out here in the real world!\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: Excuse me. As you can see, there’s been a not insignificant incident-\nWILBERFORCE: Where?\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: Well, right here!\nWILBERFORCE: Right where?\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: Here. This vehicle has been completely- (TURNS ROUND) Impossible. It’s gone. Right from under my nose. (BEAT) Madam, may I-\nWILBERFORCE: (INTERRUPTING) I can’t waste my morning bandying words with a fellow in fancy dress who clearly doesn’t know what day it is. Some of us have jams to jar and post offices to open. (GOING OFF, CALLING) I suggest you drive yourself straight back to London. And a haircut wouldn’t go amiss, while you’re about it. Good day.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 15\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: I was only going to ask if I could borrow this bike. (FX: PICKING UP BICYCLE)\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 16\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 8: EXT. MEL’S HOUSE, DOORSTEP\nBLUE DOCTOR: So Mel, you know who I am?\nMEL: Of course I do, Doctor. You just- (BREAKS OFF) What are you wearing?\nBLUE DOCTOR: This is my usual attire.\nMEL: But your coat...\nBLUE DOCTOR: The blue? Rather dignified I thought.\nMEL: It’s a bit understated... sombre... boring! Not you at all. I have to say I prefer the patchwork. At least it’s got a bit of pizzazz.\nBLUE DOCTOR: You really are a child of the Eighties, aren’t you Mel? But what are you doing here? Shouldn’t you be off travelling with a future Doctor?\nMEL: That’s what the other you said. When he left me here to meet you. I mean, not you... some other you.\nBLUE DOCTOR: The.. other me? Oh no. I’ve crossed my own timestream.\nMEL: (WORKING IT OUT) So you’re older than that Doctor... but younger than mine.\nBLUE DOCTOR: This is potentially disastrous.\nMEL: Just because I’ve told you you’re wearing the wrong coat?\nBLUE DOCTOR: Intersecting timestreams have far greater repercussions than my sartorial decisions.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 17\nMEL: So. What next, Indigo Jones?\nBLUE DOCTOR: Indigo? It’s Inigo, Mel. I’d have thought someone with your perfect recall-\nMEL: (INTERRUPTING) I know. I was making a joke.\nBLUE DOCTOR: That’s a matter of opinion. Now, I distinctly remember taking you back to- Wait. Where is he? The earlier Doctor?\nMEL: You’ve only just missed yourself. He went- (BREAKS OFF) Actually. Are you supposed to do that?\nBLUE DOCTOR: Not usually, no. But it’s not just any me. Not one of those other fellows with their scarves and frills and.. (DISDAINFUL) celery. It’s me me! I’1l be more than capable of handling the Situation.\nMEL: But if you’re older... wouldn’t you remember meeting yourself?\nBLUE DOCTOR: Thank you Mel. Just... forget you saw me. I’1l be along later!\nMEL: What do I do now? Wait for another one to turn up?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 18\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 9: INT. ATC STATION\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: B/G LOTS OF COMPUTER NOISE, WHIRRS, BEEPS, AND BLIP OF RADAR)\nPETHERBRIDGE: Tracking... Two hundred and sixty thousand feet and descending. Wonderful. We shall see you very soon.\nPETHERBRIDGE: Ah, young Melanie. Bright and early and ready for another day at the forefront of... traffic control?\nYOUNG MEL: Beat me again, Mr Petherbridge! I never know how you manage it!\nPETHERBRIDGE: At my age, it’s important to remain sprightly. You never know when you might need a turn of speed.\nYOUNG MEL: I had an excuse today. Bumped into someone outside the hall. Literally. Here to audition from the look of him.\nPETHERBRIDGE: Really? We do see all sorts passing though. I’d hoped the road restrictions might reduce the.. confusion. At least until the main event.\nYOUNG MEL: So. Where should I start today?\nPETHERBRIDGE: The whole place could do with a tidy. A general once over I think. Some pest control too.\nYOUNG MEL: Who’s that?\nJED: (OUTSIDE DOOR) Hello? Mr P? You in there?\nYOUNG MEL: (DOWNBEAT) Oh. It’s Jed.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 19\nPETHERBRIDGE: Ah. Young Master Thurwell. Come to apologise for this morning’s absence, no doubt.\nYOUNG MEL: Well, I don’t want to see him.\nPETHERBRIDGE: A little tiff? Don’t worry. I shan’t invite him in. I think I’ll pop back to the hall. I have my mobile phone. Another run- through after lunch?\nYOUNG MEL: All right, Mr Petherbridge.\nPETHERBRIDGE: (GOING TO DOOR) And Melanie. This time when you’re vacuuming, please don’t unplug the computers.\nYOUNG MEL: I’1ll try to remember!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 20\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 10: EXT. OUTSIDE ATC STATION\nPETHERBRIDGE: Jedediah. You missed the rehearsal this morning.\nJED: Sorry Mister P. Overslept I did. The Black Swan has a fine selection of ales and an even finer selection of fillies.\nPETHERBRIDGE: Ah yes. 1970s night, wasn’t it? Melanie is most perturbed. I hope you didn’t upset her.\nJED: I never meant to. She’s a lovely girl. It’s just... those ladies were so... emancipated.\nPETHERBRIDGE: Indeed. Now Jedediah, I’m informed that the Cinder Banks carriage will be crossing today from Parish Lane. It is vital that you waylay it and acquire the supplies.\nJED: I’‘ll need the lads, Mr P.\nPETHERBRIDGE: I’1l make sure they are available.\nJED: How... forcible d’you want it? Talkin’ of emancipation. Some of\nJED: those gents been away a long time.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 21\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 11: EXT. OUTSIDE ATC STATION, ALONG PATH [CONTINUOUS]\nJED: (OFF) Got a lot of anger in ‘em. Liable to kick up a shindy.\nPETHERBRIDGE: (OFF) I don’t mind at all. Just be aware the cargo is potentially lethal.\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: (TO SELF) What have we here? Plotters, eh.\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: (TO SELF) Ouch. I’m sure Mel’s handlebars left a dent.\nJED: (OFF) So the carriage’ll be horse-drawn, Mr P?\nPETHERBRIDGE: (OFF, APPROACHING) Yes. Cinder Banks usually sends four men along. Armed. But only pikes and blades.\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: (TO SELF) They’re coming this way.\nJED: (PASSING BY) Poacher Pete’s got some cables from those road- diggings. He’s been settin’ all sorts of traps along the ‘Orsham road. Wants to bag a wild boar, or maybe one o’ them dragons.\nPETHERBRIDGE: (PASSING BY) Yes, well. We’re trying to clear them out.\nJED: (PASSING BY) I thought we could put one across the road... Bury it under the dirt...\nPETHERBRIDGE: (PASSING BY) Whatever you think will work, Master Thurwell. You are the criminal expert after all.\nJED: (STOPPING) What’s that doing ‘ere?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 22\nPETHERBRIDGE: Muriel’s bicycle. The children must have taken it again.\nJED: Youths today. They’1ll pilfer anything, they will.\nPETHERBRIDGE: I sincerely hope so. (CHUCKLES) Bring it. (WALKING OFF) I need to find Mrs Wilberforce. See how preparations with her W.I. are progressing.\nJED: (WALKING OFF) My lads might be a band of neck-or-nothing ruffians, but I shouldn’t like to meet her lot in a dark alley.\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: Mr P? The ubiquitous Mr Petherbridge, I presume. Now why would the chairman of the village drama group be planning a hold-up?\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: (FX: WALKING ALONG PEBBLE PATH) And what was that young man wearing? Historical reconstruction, perhaps? With live-action dinosaurs.\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: Here we are. The ATC. Perhaps young Mel can offer some assistance...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 23\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 12: INT. ATC STATION\nYOUNG MEL: (RECITING TO HERSELF) Pease Pottage Hot, Pease Pottage cold, Pease Pottage in the pot six days old...\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: (OVER VACUUM) Hello again, Miss Bush.\nYOUNG MEL: What are you doing here? No complications I hope?\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: Don’t worry, I’m in peak condition. Well, well, well. I’ve seen a few radar stations in my time, but never one so well- equipped. (FX: STARTS TAPPING KEYBOARD)\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: One might almost say over-equipped. Now what have we here...\nYOUNG MEL: You can’t touch that! Mr Petherbridge wouldn’t like it.\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: Lend a hand, Mel. Two technical brains are better than one.\nYOUNG MEL: I don’t think you should be doing that.. Besides, I wouldn’t have a clue.\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: (DISTRACTED) Really? I thought you were fluent in all- Hold on. That’s not an aeroplane.\nYOUNG MEL: What isn’t?\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: That dish outside isn’t pointed at any local flight path. No, it’s tracking something much higher in the mesosphere.\nYOUNG MEL: How do you know that?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 24\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: And there’s an energy signal extending into the woods outside. Fifty metres west. Come on, Mel.\nYOUNG MEL: Come on? I’m working. I can’t just up and leave with a stranger.\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: That didn’t sound good.\nYOUNG MEL: That’s just the time explosion. Nothing to worry about.\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: ‘Time explosion’? I’d say that’s most definitely something to worry about.\nYOUNG MEL: Mr Petherbridge says it’s just an echo.\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: Does he now? He exerts quite an influence in these parts, this Petherbridge. (LEAVING) Perhaps it is safest you stay here, Mel. While I investigate.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 25\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 13: INT. MARDAK SHIP, BRIDGE\nMARDAK PILOT: Entering atmosphere now, Captain. Scanning.\nKALLAK: Hold her steady, pilot.\nMARDAK PILOT: Source confirmed.\nVANEESH: (VIA INTERCOM) Are we there yet, Kallak?\nKALLAK: Almost. I’ll rally the troops. You should run your presentation, Vaneesh.\nVANEESH: (D) Actioning that now, Captain.\nKALLAK: Looks like quite a haul for your first job.\nVANEESH: (D) Just nice to P. O. something this big.\nKALLAK: It’s luck, Vaneesh. This was supposed to be a training flight. But business protocols have been engaged, and you technically outrank me. Not sure you’re ready to be Project Overseer...\nVANEESH: (D) You know how to boost a girl’s confidence, Captain.\nKALLAK: Let’s see how you do. Remember. Mardak HomeCorp is watching.\nVANEESH: (D) (OFF) Deerek, get my nanodrive, will you. Set up deck two.\nKALLAK: I’1ll break out the valanxium. Open the Channel. Don’t be too long. Twenty slides max.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 26\nVANEESH: (D) I’ve forty-seven, but I’m sure I can whip through! I thought I’d start with- (FX: COMMS BEEP AS KALLAK CUTS HER OFF)\nKALLAK: (DISDAINFUL) Graduates...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 27\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 14: EXT. PEASE POTTAGE, HORSHAM ROAD\nBLUE DOCTOR: Let’s see... Horsham Road. This way to the village, that towards... Ah. I’d recognise that motley anywhere. There I am!\nBLUE DOCTOR: (CALLING & CATCHING UP) Doctor! Doctor, wait!\nBLUE DOCTOR: Aaaaargh!\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: (RUNNING UP FROM RIGHT) Look out! Watch your step. The road’s covered with-\nBLUE DOCTOR: (L) (CALLING DOWN) Traps. Yes. I had noticed.\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: (R) (SURPRISED) It’s you — I mean, me! What am I doing up there? Apart from... hanging around?\nBLUE DOCTOR: (L) (CALLING DOWN) Could you get me down please?\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: (R) Certainly Doctor... I presume you are a future iteration, Since I don’t recall meeting myself in a similar predicament... (BEAT) But then...\nBLUE DOCTOR: (L) (CALLING DOWN) Yes? Can you hurry it up?\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: (R) Just a moment. Surely my future self would be fully aware of the traps on the road and so would not be fool enough to step into one.\nBLUE DOCTOR: (L) (CALLING DOWN) You’re over-thinking. I can’t be expected to remember every little thing. We’re all allowed an off day...\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: (R) Why are you wearing Necros mourning colours?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 28\nBLUE DOCTOR: (L) (CALLING DOWN) Tastes change. My demeanour certainly has. I’d forgotten I could be so... obstreperous!\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: (R) Given the peculiarities I’ve encountered already today... how do I know you’re not a trap? An imposter? Out to ensnare me.\nBLUE DOCTOR: (L) (CALLING DOWN) Well, I wouldn’t be doing a very good job of it up here.\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: (R) Something strange is going on... Right now, I’ve no idea what I’m dealing with...\nBLUE DOCTOR: (L) (CALLING DOWN) On that we agree.\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: (R) (SUSPICIOUS) Anyone could say they’re the Doctor. Any number of alien intelligences could contrive to look like me.\nBLUE DOCTOR: (L) Oh, for goodness sake... Perhaps a little telepathy might clear things up?

Along here wasn’t it?\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: (R) Yes, but I don’t see why I should be the one to leave.\nBLUE DOCTOR: (L) Mel’s future is at stake. You must go.

Though she\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: seems a little... incomplete.\nBLUE DOCTOR: (L) No. I’m your future, and I haven’t met her yet. You shouldn’t be here at all.

It’s decided. You, young Doctor, deal with the alien vessel. Stop the invasion.\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: (R) Yet another collection of extraterrestrials out to conquer the earth... Why do I get the boring job?\nBLUE DOCTOR: (L) I’ve more experience of temporal anomalies. I’ve more experience full stop. Now, Mel, I assume you have the IT skills your counterpart is lacking...\nMEL: Lacking? What’s wrong with her?\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: (R) Actually, I'd prefer this Mel’s help. The other one’s useless. What do we call her, by the way? Mel the Younger? Mini-Mel? Mel minora?\nMEL: Hey, I’m not some parcel you can pass back and forth.\nBLUE DOCTOR: (L) Young Mel seems rather in thrall to this Petherbridge. I'd like you to keep her away from him for a while.\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: (R) Who made you boss?\nBLUE DOCTOR: (L) I did.\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: (R) I still don’t see why I get the aliens.

Bush.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 54\nMEL: Yes, I know. It’s me.\nBLUE DOCTOR: (L) No, Mel. Hide. In that bush. If she’s under some kind of mind control, we’d best not overload her.\nMEL: (FX: GETTING PUSHED INTO BUSHES) Oof!\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: (R) Actually, you should probably- Oh, too late.\nYOUNG MEL: Oh. There are two of you now?\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: (R) Yes. This is my... um... twin. We work together. Occasionally.\nBLUE DOCTOR: (FX: GOING INTO BUSHES) Can’t stop. Better just check this foliage.

So where are these aliens?\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: There’s something in the air. Setting my teeth on edge.\nYOUNG MEL: Like a thunderstorm brewing. We’re out of the trees at least.\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: According to your radar, their beam reaches just over there. What’s that flag?\nYOUNG MEL: The fifteenth hole, I think. Look, someone’s left their clubs.\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: Stay here, Mel. Under cover.\nYOUNG MEL: What is that? An orange... doorway? Hanging in the air!\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: A Valanxium Channel. On a golf course. How appropriate. Now what are they doing here?\nYOUNG MEL: Who?\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: Mardaks. An entire species dedicated to one of the most despicable occupations in the civilised universe.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 57\nYOUNG MEL: What are they? Robbers?

(DISDAINFULLY) Business consultants...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 58\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 31: INT. MARDAK SHIP, CONFERENCE ROOM\nVANEESH: (FX: ON MIC, PRESENTING) And the next slide please, Deerek.\nVANEESH: (FX: ON MIC) Sorry. This chart’s a bit busy. But if you look at your handouts...\nVANEESH: (FX: ON MIC) You’1ll see the imagineered valanxium yield is twenty times expenditure. It’s all low-hanging fruit on this one, people.\nVANEESH: (SOTTO) Next slide.\nVANEESH: So. We dynamically steer ourselves like any client. Keep our prob-jective CLEVER.\nVANEESH: That’s Costed. Leveraged. Efficient. Value-added. Essential. And Reversible.\nKALLAK: (COUGHS) Facilitator Vaneesh.. If we could wrap this up? The Channel’s open.\nVANEESH: (OVER NOISE, RACING THROUGH SLIDES) In conclusion. I want alpha players with a can-do headset! Be fifteen percent better than your best! Remember our brand-message: Delivering tomorrow, today!\nVANEESH: (OVER NOISE) Above all - have fun!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 59\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 32: EXT. BUCHAN HILL FOREST, EDGE OF GOLF COURSE\nYOUNG MEL: What’s valanxium?\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: A very dangerous, very volatile element. And an extremely valuable one.\nYOUNG MEL: Why? What’s it for?\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: It saves time. It can be used to extrude short-range passage through the vortex. The Mardaks’ primitive technology allows hops of several thousand miles. With zero travel costs.\nYOUNG MEL: I see.\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: The only trouble is, valanxium is chronically unstable.\nYOUNG MEL: You mean, it keeps falling to bits?\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: (IMPATIENTLY) No, I mean its chronons are liable to come unfixed from the timeline. Do pay attention. And punching holes in the vortex willy-nilly is never a good idea.\nYOUNG MEL: I understand the bit about dangerous, at least. So that’s their business? Selling these Channels?\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: The ability to ship anything instantly from its point of origin to its point of use. Convenient, yes. But...\nYOUNG MEL: Isn’t that a good thing? Scientific advancement?\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: Not always. It renders the game of golf pointless for a start.\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: (BEAT) Perhaps that’s a bad example.\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: As Francis Bacon put it: ‘Travel, in the younger sort, is a part of education; in the elder, a part of experience.’\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 60\nYOUNG MEL: Oh wow... Aliens... Real aliens. They’re purple!\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: Used to be grey. A focus group decided this particular shade of violet ‘created impact with the client base while maintaining a non-threatening aura’. So they bio-engineered it into their DNA. Everyone else just thinks it clashes terribly with whatever they wear. Those mustard business suits are a mistake...\nYOUNG MEL: (SOTTO) People in glass houses... (ALOUD) What are they carrying?\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: Looks like digging equipment. Mini-Mel, pass me that golf bag...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 61\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 33: EXT. VALANXIUM CHANNEL, GOLF COURSE\nVANEESH: (FX: BEEPING SCANNER) OK then. Team Aptitude. Start over here.\nKALLAK: Gervin and Wardek, that’s your lot. Move it.\nVANEESH: And Team Stardrive. Start over there.\nKALLAK: Verlek. Craden. Get going.\nVANEESH: We should meet up fifty metres below... here. First to hit valanxium gets a HomeCorp Handshake!\nKALLAK: (ASIDE) Why don’t you just call them by their names, Vaneesh?\nVANEESH: They love the teamsmanship. Look at them go.\nKALLAK: We never used to need... ‘incentivisation’, back in the day. We did what we did for the glory of HomeCorp.\nVANEESH: It’s a new world, Kallak. These guys all want D.B.A.’s. Doctorates in Business Application guarantee a better pay-grade than Ship Captain. With my lead-spiration, they’1ll outrank you soon. Engage as Facilitators on client-worlds.\nKALLAK: Yeah? They’1l still need ships to get there.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 62\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 34: EXT. BUCHAN HILL FOREST, EDGE OF GOLF COURSE\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: Right. Enough covert observation. Let’s get their attention.\nYOUNG MEL: How are you going to do that?\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: From this distance? I think... a five iron.\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: (FX: SWING AND THWACK) Fore!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 63\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 35: INT. PEASE POTTAGE VILLAGE HALL\nPETHERBRIDGE: Pease Pottage hot. Pease Pottage cold. Pease Pottage in the pot, four days old.\nBLUE DOCTOR: Mr Petherbridge. You’re a difficult man to trace. Everywhere and nowhere.\nPETHERBRIDGE: Doctor. Would it be ever so gauche to say... I’ve been expecting you?\nBLUE DOCTOR: Hardly original. But in your case, I believe you have. Where’s my TARDIS. Our TARDISes.\nPETHERBRIDGE: And you’ve brought the delightful Miss Bush. Let me see how she turns out.\nMEL: Who are you? And what have you done to Pease Pottage?\nPETHERBRIDGE: (FX: WALKING OVER) Charming. Utterly charming. And in answer to your question, as chair of the Heritage Society, I am placing Pease Pottage at the centre of things.\nBLUE DOCTOR: Why would you want to do that? Why do you even have a Heritage Society? Forgive me Mel, but nothing much ever happened here.\nPETHERBRIDGE: On the contrary Doctor. Everything happens here. (FX: OPENING DOOR) I’11 show you.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 64\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 36: EXT. PEASE POTTAGE VILLAGE GREEN [CONTINUOUS]\nPETHERBRIDGE: (WALKING OUTSIDE) A celebration. A confluence of history. My own small recital pales in comparison.\nMEL: (FOLLOWING) Where did all the people come from? That arch wasn’t there when we arrived. What does it say?\nBLUE DOCTOR: ‘Victoria Regina.’ Spelt with dahlias. How... refined.\nPETHERBRIDGE: Her Majesty’s visit. 1837 I believe. We need to be just a smidgen soonev...\nMEL: Doctor... I can feel it. I can see the threads. It’s like sorting through my memory.\nPETHERBRIDGE: Oh very good. She has potential, Doctor.\nBLUE DOCTOR: What are you doing to her? Stop it. Now\nMEL: I- I’m OK. Just an odd sensation for a moment.\nPETHERBRIDGE: Pease Pottage. The name is so very... English. They say it comes from the pease porridge, you know. They fed it to convicts, passing through the gate.\nBLUE DOCTOR: Like many folk stories, I believe that particular explanation is apocryphal.\nPETHERBRIDGE: Really? You should ask our nineteenth century convicts for their opinion.\nPETHERBRIDGE: (FX: JUST OFF, HORSE-DRAWN WAGON ARRIVES, CHAINED CONVICTS DISEMBARK )\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 65\nMEL: Look. A wagon. With guards. And prisoners.\nPETHERBRIDGE: There they are. Half a dozen reprobates destined for the naval prison at Lewes. Disembarking for rations at the toll-gate.\nMEL: There’s Jed. He’s chained up.\nBLUE DOCTOR: Actually, Mel. That young man’s over here as well.\nJED: (FX: DISMOUNTING) Blimey. That’s what I look like.\nPETHERBRIDGE: Thank you, Jedediah. I’1ll take the horse. (FX: MOUNTING HORSE) Been a while since I rode. Got the flintlocks, lad? Pass them\nPETHERBRIDGE: up.\nJED: (HANDING GUNS TO PETHERBRIDGE) Here, Mr P. How can I be over there? And ‘ere? It don’t sit right in my head.\nBLUE DOCTOR: I’m not surprised. It could be catastrophic. You need to get right away.\nMEL: The Doctor knows what he’s talking about.\nPETHERBRIDGE: Indeed, Jed. Back to the woods with you.\nJED: (RUNNING OFF) I ain’t arguing. This is too... unnatural.\nBLUE DOCTOR: You’re picking and choosing moments from history. But how? And why?\nPETHERBRIDGE: (FX: COCKING PISTOLS) Two guards. Two shots. Master Thurwell just completed his most important task yet. Securing his own freedom.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 66\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 37: EXT. BUCHAN HILL FOREST, EDGE OF GOLF COURSE\nVANEESH: Greetings Earthling. Please do not be alarmed. My name’s Vaneesh, and I’1l be your Invasion Facilitator for the duration of this incursion. (WINCING) We’1ll overlook the projectiles for now.\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: I’ll put this simply. Leave. This. Planet.\nVANEESH: Lesser species can be disorientated when they come under Mardak HomeCorp control. So we’ve prepared a welcome pack for all new affiliates.\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: I don’t want your brochure. Pack up your buckets and spades and\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: go.\nYOUNG MEL: Doctor, aren’t you being a bit [rude?]\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: Leave this to me, mini-Mel.\nVANEESH: Sorry, I can’t expect an inferior life-form to understand the complexities of our prob-jective. (BEAT) Who were you talking to?\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: Prob-jective?\nVANEESH: Project objective. As I say, a native-\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: (INTERRUPTING) You’re mistaken, Facilitator. I’m not\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: indigenous.\nVANEESH: One moment.\nYOUNG MEL: Doctor. What’s she doing?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 67\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: A bioscan.\nKALLAK: (WALKING UP) Trouble, Vaneesh? Don’t tell me - residential objections?\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: I’m not a resident.\nVANEESH: Higher species. Competition. That rebrands my perspective...\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: I hate to say I told you so...\nYOUNG MEL: (SOTTO) I don’t think you do...\nVANEESH: Any threat to Mardak monopoly must be removed. With extreme prejudice. Kallak.\nKALLAK: Facilitator?\nVANEESH: Incinerate the competition.\nYOUNG MEL: No!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 68\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 38: EXT. PEASE POTTAGE VILLAGE GREEN\nPETHERBRIDGE: (CALLING) Guards. Your attention!\nMEL: Don’t shoot them. You mustn’t!\nBLUE DOCTOR: Mel, Be careful.\nPETHERBRIDGE: They’ve vanished. You’re improving at this, Melanie. Not a shot need be fired.\nMEL: No!\nBLUE DOCTOR: It’s all right Mel. He just broke the prisoners’ chains.\nPETHERBRIDGE: (CALLING) Release your associates, young Jed.\nJED: (CALLING OVER) Thank you sir. We’re in your debt sir.\nPETHERBRIDGE: Good. You man. Poacher Pete is it? Hold the girl. I needn’t remind you who has the weapons.\nMEL: (STRUGGLING) Get off me you-\nPETHERBRIDGE: The rest of you. The... ‘magistrate’ in the blue coat.\nBLUE DOCTOR: (STRUGGLING) I don’t know what you hope to achieve with this petty display of brute force...\nPETHERBRIDGE: A lesson in causality, Doctor. I tell these men to tie you to\nPETHERBRIDGE: that cart. So they do. (BEAT, SHOUTS) Do it!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 69\nBLUE DOCTOR: (STRUGGLING) No!\nPETHERBRIDGE: Tie him, Master Thurwell.\nBLUE DOCTOR: (STRUGGLING) Unhand me. Let me go.\nPETHERBRIDGE: Behind you. Crates of gunpowder. The fuse will give you one minute. Maybe two. Time for you to think on this conundrum. This cart was stolen by these men. Yet I’ve only just freed them for that purpose.\nMEL: Stop it! Just let him go!\nPETHERBRIDGE: As I say. A lesson in causality. And how I control it.\nBLUE DOCTOR: What are you, Petherbridge?\nPETHERBRIDGE: Goodbye Doctor, I’ve a reality to arrange. (FX: DISASSEMBLING FLINTLOCK, TROTTING HORSE) Here’s a flint, Jedediah. Light the fuse. Yah!\nBLUE DOCTOR: Jed. You don’t have to listen to him.\nJED: (FX: STRIKING FLINT) How- how do you all know who I am?\nMEL: Please, Jed. Don’t do it!\nJED: Sorry, Miss. No choice, Miss. Don’t think I ever had.\nMEL: No!\nMEL: END OF PART TWO\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 70"

Tea and lardy johns. One flask between three. Mugs on the trolley.\nMILLICENT: Thank you Ma’am. Good of you to wheel this all the way out here.\nWILBERFORCE: No trouble at all dear. How are you getting on, Millicent?\nMILLICENT: Just about finished, ma’am. Blast caps attached. Holes almost filled. Detonation cords are all connected here.\nWILBERFORCE: We can always rely on the ladies of the Institute.\nMILLICENT: Happy to get our hands dirty. Digging for England, what? Good practice turning over the cricket pitch last... (BREAKS OFF, CONFUSED) You know, I could have sworn we dug this field over too.\nWILBERFORCE: Really, dear?\nMILLICENT: Must have dreamt it! This bally war. The days become one\nMILLICENT: sometimes.\nWILBERFORCE: Don’t I know it, dear.\nMILLICENT: (CALLING) Back to it, girls. A few more shovels and we’re done.\nWILBERFORCE: There'll be extra rations laid on at the Swan for you all.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 79\nMILLICENT: No need for that Ma’am. Let the youngsters and old folk have them.\nWILBERFORCE: Somehow, I knew you’d say that. (BEAT) It’s... so good to see you again, Millicent.\nMILLICENT: The.. planning meeting was only last night... (BEAT) You all right, Ma’am? You seem a little distracted.\nWILBERFORCE: Sorry. As you say, it’s one long day. Carry on ladies.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 80\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 43: INT. MARDAK SHIP\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: VALANXIUM CHANNEL HUM, FLASHES AS DOCTOR AND VANEESH EMERGE )\nVANEESH: Just wait here. I’1l formalise the paperwork. Bear with me, it’s my first invasion — as if you didn’t know.\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: Well, you’re doing very well. So this is your Channel control chamber?\nVANEESH: I’m sure you’re familiar with the set-up. Watercooler’s over there. Take a seat. There’s the comms. Buzz if you need anything.\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: Valanxium. Such a clumsy means of travel. And a dangerous one. (FX: TYPING AND BEEPS THROUGH) I do like a co-operative computer.\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: Valanxium pod in the hold... Twenty... twenty-five units. The Channel’s using... point zero zero two per minute.\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: Let’s see... More unstable than I thought. They haven’t even shielded it correctly. Some fine adjustments to the settings, I think. Can’t have this Channel left open once we get back...\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: And a communicator, eh? Let’s see if there’s anyone out there worth talking to.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 81\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 44: EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF WW I ARMY CAMP 1915, HORSHAM ROAD\nPETHERBRIDGE: 1915. The British Army encampment. I’ve saved this particular task for you, Muriel.\nWILBERFORCE: Look at them, Mr Petherbridge. Our boys. They are magnificent. I thought I might see my Francis, but he went over in 1914...\nPETHERBRIDGE: Now I don’t want you upsetting yourself. It will all be worth it in the end.\nWILBERFORCE: Seeing Millicent. Seeing all my ladies again. It brings it all back. (BEAT) We thought this was the War to end all Wars. But there we were. Twenty years later. It happened all over again.\nPETHERBRIDGE: History has no mercy, Mrs Wilberforce. No conscience. (BEAT) Now. The... detonators?\nWILBERFORCE: Back then. Back now, I mean. The first time. I wanted to go over. Volunteer. Francis was so particular about his tea, I thought they’d never get it right without me...\nPETHERBRIDGE: The blasting caps and cords are in the store behind the officers’ tents. I shall occupy them while you fill this kitbag.\nWILBERFORCE: Of course I couldn’t go. There was Frank Junior to consider. Two years old. It was hard enough he never saw his daddy again.\nPETHERBRIDGE: Now, Muriel. I told you not to fret. If you like, I’1ll give this job to Jedediah?\nWILBERFORCE: No, Mr Petherbridge. Stapleton. Please. Let me do this.\nPETHERBRIDGE: If you’re absolutely certain...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 82\nDOCTOR WHO: Look at them. So eager. So keen to get to Flanders. Wipers was the last place he.. (BEAT) When will I see him? My Francis?\nPETHERBRIDGE: It’s... not quite time for that yet.\nWILBERFORCE: No. Of course. I have to collect these things... and then...\nPETHERBRIDGE: And then, your friend Millicent can pop them in the holes.\nWILBERFORCE: When you explained before.. it all made sense. But I can’t seem to fit it together now. How does it work again?\nPETHERBRIDGE: Now, now. Chin up Muriel. Best foot forward. Don’t forget what I said-\nWILBERFORCE: Yes, Mr Petherbridge. It’ll all be worth it in the end.\nPETHERBRIDGE: Indeed it will, my dear. Indeed it will.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 83\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 45: EXT. BUCHAN HILL FOREST\nYOUNG MEL: Oh no... I’1l be late! Why am I in these woods again?\nJED: (ARRIVING) Melanie! My own Melanie.\nYOUNG MEL: I’m not talking to you, Jed. Not after... (BEAT) Why was I cross with you?\nJED: Dunno, missy. Always something it seems. Tell you what, come to the Swan with me tonight. I’1l make amends. Whatever it is I’ve done.\nYOUNG MEL: Seventies night isn’t it?\nJED: Could do with an ale. Just seen meself being dragged through the gate in chains.\nYOUNG MEL: You say the strangest things. Mind you, I’ve just seen something very odd myself... I think. Can’t quite remember now... Something... purple?\nJED: Made me ponder. When I first got here.. me and the lads hid out in the woods. Then old Petherbridge turned up. With his proposal.\nYOUNG MEL: Every day’s the same to me. Usually. Today’s been different... I think. There was someone... a Doctor?\nJED: I try not to think about it. Ties me brains in knots it does.\nYOUNG MEL: That’s the thing. I don’t think about it at all.. I can’t. But I’m sure there’s a reason I’m here. Something happened. On the golf course.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 84\nDOCTOR WHO: Back and forth. Back and forth he has me running, like a bob- tailed bunny. But it’1ll all be worth it (WITH MEL) in the end.\nYOUNG MEL: (JOINS IN) In the end... How long have you known me Jed?\nJED: Sometimes I think we just met. Others... it’s like I’ve known you all my life, Melanie. But this never happened in my life. That’s what I mean, see. Best not to think about it.\nYOUNG MEL: All your life. Yes, I remember. You can see it, can’t you?\nJED: Laid out like a story in my head. I know where I was born. Where I lived. Where I... died.\nYOUNG MEL: What did he promise you, Jed?\nJED: Freedom.\nYOUNG MEL: I know I’ve a past. A family. I know what’s happening out in the world... 1987.. But, what’s the future, Jed?\nJED: We’ve talked about this before. You never remember.\nYOUNG MEL: No. I don’t. I see where everybody’s story goes but my own.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 85\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 46: EXT. OUTSIDE ATC STATION\nBLUE DOCTOR: If you did do something back there, and it wasn’t purely down to my escapology skills...\nMEL: I told you Doctor. I could see the possibilities unfolding in front of me.\nBLUE DOCTOR: Don’t do it again, please? We don’t know what the effect might be. Your younger self is not herself at all. If you see what I mean.\nMEL: You think Petherbridge is controlling her?\nBLUE DOCTOR: Among other things. Somehow he’s thrown causality out the window. And he didn’t even have to open it first. (STOPPING) It’s centred here.\nMEL: The radar station?\nBLUE DOCTOR: Have you noticed? The walk gets shorter every time. (FX: OPENS DOOR)\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 86\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 47: INT. ATC STATION [CONTINUOUS]\nBLUE DOCTOR: (JUST OFF) Hello? Anyone home?\nMEL: (ENTERING) Look at this set-up! Now here’s something I can understand. A computer keyboard.\nBLUE DOCTOR: (FOLLOWING) Yes. Let’s put those much-vaunted skills of yours to the test, eh?\nMEL: (TYPING) I’ve never actually been here before... I certainly never worked here.\nBLUE DOCTOR: Most of this equipment shouldn’t be here either. It’s far more than a simple tracking station.\nMEL: (FX: TYPING) Strange. These systems seem very familiar... There. Done it.\nBLUE DOCTOR: Done what?\nMEL: Opened a back-door to the shell-program. You can see the subroutines... I think that’s a memory map, but I’ve got to admit I’ve no idea what these processes are doing.\nBLUE DOCTOR: Melanie Bush. You are a marvel. If you didn’t exist I’d have to invent you!\nMEL: Thanks, Indigo!\nBLUE DOCTOR: I told you, Mel, it’s Inigo- (BREAKS OFF, SUDDENLY REALIZING) Perfect recall. You said when you aligned events... It was like arranging your memories.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 87\nMEL: Putting things into logical sequences. It just comes naturally. You know I’ve got-\nBLUE DOCTOR: (INTERRUPTING) An eidetic memory. Oh no. This is a memory map. One particular person’s memory.\nMEL: You don’t mean...\nBLUE DOCTOR: I’m afraid so. Alternate timelines wink in and out of existence constantly. Every decision you make, every choice made by anyone, splinters into an infinite number of realities. If you’re going to try and monitor them, you need something much more powerful than a computer.\nBLUE DOCTOR: A.T.C. It’s not Air Traffic Control. It’s an Alternate Timeline Control!\nMEL: That mish-mash of history outside. It’s being run from here?\nBLUE DOCTOR: Not just here. He’s using your remarkable memory to manipulate the timelines.\nMEL: (REALIZING) The other me. You said she was... lacking. Half her mind’s being used as a memory buffer... No wonder she seems scatty!\nBLUE DOCTOR: More than half I’d say. But how’s he made the link?\nMEL: And why don’t I remember any of this?\nBLUE DOCTOR: She could be an alternative you. Cauterised time, remember.\nMEL: And what happens in cauterised time, stays in cauterised time?\nBLUE DOCTOR: Only in this case, I don’t think Petherbridge wants it to.\nMEL: He wants to break out.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 88\nBLUE DOCTOR: Mel. You’re in danger.\nMEL: But Doctor-\nBLUE DOCTOR: Find my other self. If\nBLUE DOCTOR: I shouldn’t have brought you here.\nBLUE DOCTOR: I remember rightly, he’s about to make a\nBLUE DOCTOR: call. I’11 send him to you.\nMEL: Where will he be?\nBLUE DOCTOR: On the golf course.\nMEL: Hardly the best time for pitch and putt!\nBLUE DOCTOR: That’s not a bad idea.\nBLUE DOCTOR: It’d keep him out of trouble. Stay away\nBLUE DOCTOR: from your younger self. Go!\nMEL: (RUNNING OUT) Understood! Good luck, Indigo!\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: (VIA INTERCOM) Hello. Doctor calling Doctor. Come in Doctor.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 89\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 48: INT. MARDAK SHIP\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: Come in, Doctor.\nBLUE DOCTOR: (VIA INTERCOM) I am receiving you.\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: There you are, Doctor. Now listen carefully. I’m in a Mardak vessel. Geostationary orbit. Directly above Pease Pottage radar.\nBLUE DOCTOR: (VIA INTERCOM) You do realise this is completely pointless?\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: It’s got a cargo of valanxium.\nBLUE DOCTOR: (VIA INTERCOM) Which is showing signs of instability. Yes. I remember. Come back to Earth.\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: But listen. There’s a consortium of Mardaks here-\nBLUE DOCTOR: (VIA INTERCOM) And you think they’re digging for something which doesn’t exist. Look. You can’t tell me anything I don’t already know. You need to listen to me-\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 90\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 49: INT. ATC STATION\nBLUE DOCTOR: Get back to the mine. I’ve sent Mel A. Keep her away from Mel B. Whatever you do, don’t [try to]-\nPETHERBRIDGE: That’s quite enough of that. Talking to yourself, Doctor? Isn’t that the first sign of madness?\nBLUE DOCTOR: Petherbridge. I’m afraid I must defer to your expertise in that particular field...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 91\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 50: INT. MARDAK SHIP\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: Hello? Hello? It’s a Valanxium Channel, but I’ve fixed it.\nVANEESH: (ENTERING) Authorisation posted and approved. Erm. What were you doing?\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: Trying to.. order a frappachino?\nVANEESH: I’ve got so many sharings on motivational behaviours to inter-\nVANEESH: present. I’m passionate about HomeCorp’s future going forward.\nVANEESH: (FX: COMMUNICATOR) Kallak. I’m shifting your end of the Channel into the mine. Fifty metres down.\nKALLAK: (VIA COM) Copy that, Vaneesh.\nVANEESH: (AT CONTROLS) Have you... touched these controls?\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: Just.. checking your work.\nVANEESH: OK. Let’s head back. After you, Assessor. I mean — Doctor.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 92\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 51: EXT. BUCHAN HILL FOREST\nJED: All I’m saying is, it don’t do to think too hard about these things. Way I see it, we’re here. Might as well enjoy ourselves.\nYOUNG MEL: I know. You’re right. I just-\nJED: Come here.\nYOUNG MEL: I’m going to be late...\nYOUNG MEL: Someone’s coming. Who’s there?\nMEL: Oh, sorry.. This is embarrassing. Er. Hello.\nJED: Oh my days. Is Christmas come early?\nYOUNG MEL: So you’re the Mel Bush everyone thinks is so great.\nMEL: I’m sorry. Again. I didn’t mean to... Look. I know I’m supposed to stay away, but I’ve got to ask. What are you even doing here?\nYOUNG MEL: That’s the million dollar question. What am I doing here? Everyone else has jobs to do, but all I’m good for is cleaning up after them.\nMEL: But... it’s 1987. You should be away at university.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 93\nYOUNG MEL: Sorry not to meet your high standards, but I don’t remember ever getting accepted.\nJED: I don’t suppose you’d like to come for an ale with us tonight. We could all get acquainted.\nYOUNG MEL: Go away, Jed.\nJED: No harm in asking, is there?\nMEL: Something’s happened to you, Mel. I don’t care what the Doctor says. I’m going to help you.\nJED: Don’t suppose there’s anything I-\nMEL: You heard her. Go away, Jed.\nJED: (GOING OFF) All right, all right. A fella can feel unloved, you know.\nYOUNG MEL: Thanks. I don’t think I can cope with him right now. On top of everything else. Oh no. I should be at the hall.\nMEL: I’1l come with you. It’s a good a place as any to get started.\nYOUNG MEL: I need to rehearse. (BEAT) Get started on what?\nMEL: What’s the matter? Never heard of self-help?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 94\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 52: INT. ATC STATION\nBLUE DOCTOR: One thing I’ve noticed. The people, the events, the dinosaurs-\nPETHERBRIDGE: We've dealt with them.\nBLUE DOCTOR: This is a pot pourri of Pease Pottage past, there’s nothing from the future.\nPETHERBRIDGE: Because tomorrow belongs to me.\nBLUE DOCTOR: With one exception. Telepathic circuitry? There’s never been any in Pease Pottage.\nPETHERBRIDGE: Oh but there has, Doctor. Twice over. At least.\nBLUE DOCTOR: My... TARDIS. How did you get access?\nPETHERBRIDGE: It’s the other way around. She has passed through me. So many times.\nBLUE DOCTOR: You’re a creature of the vortex.\nPETHERBRIDGE: Yes Doctor. I am a Time Demon!\nBLUE DOCTOR: Time Demon? There’s no such thing!\nPETHERBRIDGE: There is. Was. And always will be.\nBLUE DOCTOR: Nonsense. You’re a has-been. A never-was. An afterthought with malice aforethought. An idea that’s got above its station. Take Pease Pottage and you think you own the world.\nPETHERBRIDGE: I control the now. I have nixed the causal nexus.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 95\nBLUE DOCTOR: Nixed, eh? Yes, that’s what you are. A nix. A nuisance, a Sussex knucker. A pest. Time Demon? More like a Time Louse.\nPETHERBRIDGE: Your opinion counts for nothing Doctor. You will become the irrelevance.\nBLUE DOCTOR: These plans. These events. You’re getting your ducks in a row. Even though some haven’t hatched, and others are sitting ina piquant orange sauce...\nPETHERBRIDGE: Accusing me of ‘fowl’ play, Doctor? But you’re the one whose goose has been cooked.\nBLUE DOCTOR: Forget the ‘poultry’ puns, Petherbridge. You tried to blow me\nBLUE DOCTOR: up.\nPETHERBRIDGE: Yes. Melanie’s.. capabilities are impressive.\nBLUE DOCTOR: As I thought. A test. To see if she could manipulate the timelines as well as your captive Mel. I didn’t think you really wanted rid of me.\nPETHERBRIDGE: Don’t flatter yourself. It matters not what happens to you. Mel’s the important one. She’s the weak point in space and time. Her travels with you, they twist and turn upon themselves. The strands of Time tangle around her.\nBLUE DOCTOR: No...\nPETHERBRIDGE: You’ve bounced her through the temporal universe so far and so wide... You should see what I see, Time Lord. They throng to her like moths to a flame. The Vortisaurs, the Chronovores, the Pantophageans — the creeping, swarming things of the Vortex. They all want a piece.\nPETHERBRIDGE: But she is mine! Pease Pottage’s most influential daughter. Miss Melanie Bush.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 96\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 53: INT. VILLAGE HALL\nMEL: The Village Hall. I remember the first time I got up on this stage. Angel Gabriel in the nativity. 1973. (FX: CLIMBING ON STAGE )\nYOUNG MEL: And 1974. And 1975.\nMEL: After that I was more interested in reciting the periodic table.. Though there were a couple of mum’s Abba-themed fundraisers. You must remember them too?\nYOUNG MEL: (FX: CLIMBING ON STAGE) (TRANCELIKE) Pease Pottage hot. Pease Pottage cold.\nMEL: I know that one.\nYOUNG MEL: Pease Pottage in the pot one day old.\nMEL: That’s not how it goes... (DAZED) I.. I.. (ENTRANCED) Yes. Yes it is. I remember...\nYOUNG MEL: It’s time.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 97\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 54: INT. PIT, GOLF COURSE\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: B/G HUM OF VALANXIUM CHANNEL, FLASH OF DOCTOR AND VANEESH EMERGING)\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: Nice... er, hole you’ve dug here. Very... functional. (BEAT) What are they? Embedded in the walls up there?\nKALLAK: Local detritus. You neglected to bring any ladders, Vaneesh. You two, with me. We’ll get platforms from the ship.\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: They look like... boxes. Can you scan them from here?\nVANEESH: Actioning.. (FX: SCANNER) Potassium nitrite. Sulphur. Some carbonised material.\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: Oh no. Black powder.\nVANEESH: Beg pardon?\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: A primitive but very effective explosive. We may have a problem. Quickly — back through the Channel!\nVANEESH: Stay right where you are everyone. Nobody on my team gives up. There are no problems. Only challenges.\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: Well I look forward to seeing how you address the ‘challenge’ of being blown to kingdom come. Now move, before it-\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: Ah.\nVANEESH: What happened to my Valanxium Channel?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 98\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: I.. er, programmed it to shut down. We’re stuck. This isn’t just\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: a hole, Vaneesh. Your men have dug their own grave. And I’ve just put the nail in the coffin.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 99\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 55: INT. ATC STATION\nBLUE DOCTOR: So, my other self is walking into a trap. But if he’s killed...\nPETHERBRIDGE: All you’ve done since you were him. Wiped from existence. Your travels with the scholar, the thief, the girls you met and never met... or are they yet to come?\nBLUE DOCTOR: You can’t...\nPETHERBRIDGE: Everything. Deleted from the timelines. Such sweet chaos! So many lives will unhappen. This world alone will be destroyed again and again.\nBLUE DOCTOR: That’s what you feed on. The chaos.\nPETHERBRIDGE: I breathe the time winds. But the vortex is dry. Barren. Out there’s a banquet of possibilities. Creatures with free will.\nPETHERBRIDGE: Your past self will perish. Consumed in the Mardaks’ destruction. Your footprint extends across space and time. I wonder what the universe will be without you? (BEAT) No. I know. It will be mine.\nBLUE DOCTOR: But if I die when I’m him.. what happens to me?\nPETHERBRIDGE: You become an anachronism. This pocket will collapse and the raving, starving parasites of the Vortex will feast on you. Listen. They’re coming!\nBLUE DOCTOR: No...\nPETHERBRIDGE: Run, Doctor! Run! But where will you go? To save your other self. Or your companion? Decisions, decisions.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 100\nBLUE DOCTOR: (FX: RUNS TO DOOR) Mel. I’ve got to find Mel.\nPETHERBRIDGE: The circle closes. I bring about my own existence. And take my place in reality.\nBLUE DOCTOR: (FX: OPENING DOOR, HOWLING WINDS OUTSIDE) I’11 stop you, Petherbridge!\nPETHERBRIDGE: (LAUGHING) How delicious. A Time Lord who’s run out of time!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 101\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 56: EXT. GOLF COURSE\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: (CALLING, OFF IN PIT) Hello? Is there someone up there?\nJED: (IGNORING DOCTOR) Well. Here we are Mrs W.\nWILBERFORCE: Here we are Master Thurwell. You know how it works?\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: (CALLING, OFF) We seem to be trapped inside a very large bomb.\nJED: Just press down on this ‘ere handle.\nWILBERFORCE: That’s right. Who’d have thought I’d be relying on a young hooligan to bring about a better world. Ready?\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: (CALLING, OFF) Can anyone hear me?\nJED: Ready.\nWILBERFORCE: Three...

You wish passage, sir?\nRIDER: That I do. What’s the toll for Pease Pottage Gate?\nPETHERBRIDGE: One horse. That’d be sixpence sir.\nRIDER: (GOING SLIGHTLY OFF) There’s the rub, toll-man. I’m afraid the innkeeper’s had my silver tonight.\nPETHERBRIDGE: Hold, sir. I see what you’re at. Don’t you try it!\nRIDER: Out of the way little man!\nPETHERBRIDGE: You can’t jump the gate!\nPETHERBRIDGE: (FX: HORSE GALLOPS AND JUMPS GATE, PETHERBRIDGE CHASES DOWN ROAD)\nRIDER: Watch me!

In terror. Alone in the dark on tempestuous seas. Nobody would want that... I... would not want that.\nPETHERBRIDGE: What possibilities inhabit this patch of earth? This ‘Pease Pottage’.

But you’ve stopped it. For now.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 107\nMEL: What was that noise?\nBLUE DOCTOR: The sound of this reality collapsing on itself.\nMEL: I saw it. The gunpowder in the mine! We’ve got to stop that explosion!\nBLUE DOCTOR: Actually... I already have. Petherbridge isn’t the only one who can load the dice.\nMEL: Wires?\nBLUE DOCTOR: Detonator cords. Back when I arrived, you sent me after my younger self. I heard that explosion’s echo. And found these sticking out of the fifteenth fairway.\nMEL: So you pulled them out?\nBLUE DOCTOR: If nothing else, they’d have ruined anyone’s chance of a birdie.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 108\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 60: EXT.

I don’t understand.\nJED: You and me both, Mother Wilberforce.\nWILBERFORCE: This was supposed to be the end of it. Our new world.\nJED: What’s he expect us to do now?\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: (OFF, IN PIT) Hello? Is there someone up there?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 109\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 61: EXT. IN VALANXIUM MINE, GOLF COURSE\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: I think they’ve gone.\nVANEESH: You... closed my Channel?\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: An initiative test. To test... inside-the-box thinking. I didn’t expect sabotage. Fortunately, you had the foresight to send your Captain back to the ship...\nVANEESH: I did? I did! (INTO COMMUNICATOR) Kallak, you read me, Captain?\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: I’ll be a lot happier when I’m not standing under six crates of gunpowder.\nKALLAK: (VIA COMMUNICATOR) Vaneesh. Re-initialising your Channel. We’re experiencing some unusual phenomena.\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: I’m sure they are. Explain to me again why you’re digging? Your ‘prob-jective’ ?\nVANEESH: We’re here for the valanxium.\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: That’s what I thought. You do know it doesn’t exist here?\nVANEESH: There’s a signal. We picked it up directly overhead. Traced it here. Look. It’s still showing. (FX: SCANNER)\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: You haven’t a clue, have you... ? (TAKING SCANNER) Let me. Valanxium is chronically unstable. It decays backwards through time. This trace is from something that isn’t here yet.\nVANEESH: Then we wait!\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: How many people are down here?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 110\nVANEESH: Two teams of twelve. Plus me.\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: With an average of.. what? Ten years service running Channels?\nVANEESH: Experience isn’t necessarily-\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: You’re riddled with valanxium. Bury you lot and you create a deposit that’d take... two hundred years to decay. Backwards. You’re the trace.\nKALLAK: (VIA COMMUNICATOR) Channel open.\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: Let’s not let that happen, eh?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 111\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 62: INT. PEASE POTTAGE VILLAGE HALL\nMEL: How is she? The younger me?\nBLUE DOCTOR: Don’t touch! I’m not sure Blinovitch had a special theory for cauterised time, but I’d rather not push our luck. (CHECKS UNCONSCIOUS MEL) Unconscious. Oblivious. Let her rest for now.\nMEL: I thought she might be an alternative me... if I’d missed university, or kept up dance with Miss Fairs instead of trips to the Science Museum with Uncle John... But... she’s missing so much.\nBLUE DOCTOR: We can’t know for sure. Her memory’s occupied by the ATC. I should get back there.\nMEL: I’m coming with you.\nBLUE DOCTOR: Oh no you’re not. His processor’s out of action. Petherbridge will be looking for a back-up.\nMEL: I’ve got to do something.\nBLUE DOCTOR: See if you can persuade that boyfriend of hers to bring me some gunpowder.\nMEL: He’s not her boyfriend.\nBLUE DOCTOR: Try anyway. He’s up by the golf course. I’ve a theory I’d like to test.\nMEL: With explosives?\nBLUE DOCTOR: Yes. I do seem to spend an inordinate amount of time in this regeneration blowing things up.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 112\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 63: INT. ATC STATION\nPETHERBRIDGE: Why hasn’t it worked? Why am I still in this pocket?\nPETHERBRIDGE: It’s... expanding again. Where’s the control? Where’s Melanie... The valanxium surge? Where are the Mardak bodies?\nPETHERBRIDGE: (ANGRY) What have you done, Doctor?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 113\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 64: INT. MARDAK SHIP\nKALLAK: See. Same again. Fly a thousand metres from geostationary, we arrive back where we started.\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: Fascinating, Captain.\nKALLAK: So we tried the Channels. Thought we could bunny-hop out. But we can’t extend one further than a klick in any direction other than straight down.\nVANEESH: I don’t understand. (WHISPERS) Is this part of the assessment?\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: So. Much as I’d like you to leave, you can’t. Not until you’ve paid the toll.\nVANEESH: Toll? What toll?\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: Didn’t you think it suspicious, a sudden valanxium signal ina sector with no previous record?\nVANEESH: I don’t question opportunities. I take them!\nPETHERBRIDGE: (ARRIVING) A commendable attitude. Excuse me. Your door was open. I wonder. Might I interest you in a business opportunity?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 114\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 65: EXT. BUCHAN HILL FOREST\nMEL: So, you’re clear. Take the cart from the green back to Mr Petherbridge at the radar.\nJED: Yes, Miss. Bossy little madam, ain’t you? Not like my- [Mel]\nMEL: Just do it, will you?\nWILBERFORCE: Young Melanie could learn from you, dear. (BEAT) Mr Petherbridge didn’t really send you, did he?\nMEL: I’m sorry. He’s tricked you into doing his dirty work. The Doctor’s here to help.\nWILBERFORCE: Are you going back there? To the radar?\nMEL: I’m supposed to stay away.\nWILBERFORCE: I wanted to believe in him. That everything he promised would come true. That it’d all be worth it in the end.\nMEL: That’s what he said?\nWILBERFORCE: I was at the post office. After the war. They said I should’ve retired. But I said I’1l decide when I’m ready, thank you very much. Then he walked in. He showed me my wedding day. 1910.\nWILBERFORCE: We found each other late, my Francis and I... Wasted so much time...\nMEL: What did he promise you?\nWILBERFORCE: Certainty. Things would stop... changing. Go back to how they were. We’d have the time we missed.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 115\nMEL: It wouldn’t be real. You already know the life you lived.\nWILBERFORCE: We just had to complete these chores... It all fitted together... I do like to keep myself busy.\nMEL: I knew your... grandson, I think. Mr Wilberforce ran the post office in my day.\nWILBERFORCE: Martin. Frank Junior’s boy. His mother was that Jeannie. Wore too much makeup. Couldn’t fold a napkin to save her life.\nMEL: You shouldn’t judge by appearances, you know. The family seemed\nMEL: very happy.\nWILBERFORCE: I.. think I want to go home now.\nMEL: (BEAT) All right. I can take you.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 116\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 66: INT. MARDAK SHIP\nVANEESH: That’s quite a proposal.\nPETHERBRIDGE: All of history. Millennia of human evolution in one square mile. As much manpower as you require. Thousands. Hundreds of thousands.\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: Don’t listen to him. It’s a trap.\nVANEESH: And you just need twenty five of my men to stay?\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: In a trap.\nVANEESH: He’s human. He’s entitled to negotiate on behalf of his territory.\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: Of his trap.\nPETHERBRIDGE: It’s a limited offer. Time is short.\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: You see. He’s rushing you. Did I mention it’s a trap?\nPETHERBRIDGE: Who speaks for Mardak? You, Doctor? Or the Facilitator?\nVANEESH: Kallak. Micro-conference. One minute, gents!\nPETHERBRIDGE: (CLOSE) Any annoyance you might cause is tempered by the fact that you’1l soon be eliminated.\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: (CLOSE) One question, Petherbridge... What did you do to Young Mel? I know she’s uncoupled from the timelines - the Mardaks couldn’t see her. But her brainpower’s been compromised.\nPETHERBRIDGE: (CLOSE) Hers is a mayfly mind. No more than a day’s worth of memories. The rest’s required for... processing.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 117\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: That poor girl.\nKALLAK: (CLOSE) Facilitator, you can’t seriously...\nVANEESH: There’s always a need for manual labour at the practical end of the supply chain.\nKALLAK: The mines.\nVANEESH: I could network Channel-links all the way to Mardak Prime. The ‘Vaneesh Distribuline’. I can see the logo already...\nKALLAK: You’re talking about slaves.\nVANEESH: That’s an ugly word. I prefer the term non-voluntary micro- budget functionary-stakeholders. (ALOUD) Mr Petherbridge — let’s dialogue.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 118\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 67: INT. ATC STATION\nBLUE DOCTOR: (WORKING) Every technology passing through Pease Pottage. Cannibalised.. Tracking timelines... converging here. On Mel.\nBLUE DOCTOR: And those two. The convict and the not-so-merry widow. You could have chosen anyone who visited at any point in history. Even royalty. Why them?\nMEL: (ENTERING) Doctor...\nBLUE DOCTOR: Mel! I told you to keep away from here.\nWILBERFORCE: (ENTERING) She’s here to help me.\nBLUE DOCTOR: I was just untangling your history, Mrs Wilberforce. You've lived quite a life. Several times over it seems.\nMEL: Tell him, Muriel. What you told me.\nWILBERFORCE: My grandson, Martin. He went through the parish records. Family trees. Heritage. A Stapleton Petherbridge worked the Pease Pottage tollgate in the late 1700s.\nMEL: And the rest.\nWILBERFORCE: I was born in 1884.\nMEL: Which is when Jed said he died. And I was born in 1964.\nWILBERFORCE: The year I passed on.\nBLUE DOCTOR: Overlaps.. You’re links in a temporal daisy-chain! Keeping Petherbridge anchored to now. To you, Mel.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 119\nWILBERFORCE: Will you take me back, dear? I’m ready.\nBLUE DOCTOR: Take you back..? (BEAT) No, Mel. If you allow the ATC inside your head-\nMEL: (INTERRUPTING) Don’t you see? If I send them back where they belong, he’s weakened.\nBLUE DOCTOR: It’s too dangerous.\nMEL: I’ve promised.\nWILBERFORCE: I want to go. I’1ll make it easy.\nMEL: I can do it Doctor. I know I can.\nBLUE DOCTOR: Oh, I’m sure you can... (BEAT) Very well. But I’1l be monitoring every nanosecond!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 120\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 68: INT. MRS WILBERFORCE’S LOUNGE, PEASE POTTAGE 1964\nFRANK: Mum, Jeannie’s made you a nice cup of tea. Another funny turn, eh? We’ve called Dr Weston to check you over. You’1ll see us all out, won’t you mum...\nMEL: (V/O) Muriel Wilberforce. Born 1884. Lives all her life in Pease Pottage. One son. Francis Junior.\nWILBERFORCE: (FX: ECHOEY, DISCONNECTED) Frank. You’re so like your father. How he’d have looked if he’d got to your age.\nFRANK: Mum? Can you hear me? Oh no... (FX: DROPPED CUP) (CALLING) Jeannie!\nWILBERFORCE: (FX: ECHOEY) Never liked her curtains. But I suppose she’ll do. She’1l look after him.\nFRANK: Mum? Jeannie! (FX: FADING OUT) Call an ambulance!\nWILBERFORCE: (FX: ECHOEY, FADING) Oh my, but it’s pretty in the sunlight. My village. My home. My Pease Pottage.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 121\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 69: INT. ATC STATION\nBLUE DOCTOR: Mel... Mel!\nMEL: (HEAVY INTAKE OF BREATH, AS IF SURFACING FROM UNDERWATER) D- Doctor?\nBLUE DOCTOR: Thank goodness. You did it. At quite considerable risk.\nMEL: (EXHAUSTED) Next up, Jed.\nBLUE DOCTOR: No. I can’t let you go through that again.\nMEL: But there’s no-one else.\nBLUE DOCTOR: Ah. I monitored your brain activity... so I could replicate it. I'll take care of Master Thurwell. And Petherbridge.\nMEL: It’s still a risk.\nBLUE DOCTOR: This is all my fault, Mel. I shouldn't be here. I was... lonely. I wanted to chivvy Time along. I should know you can't force the hand of fate.\nMEL: What can I do?\nBLUE DOCTOR: Find my other self. He doesn’t have the benefit of my hindsight. Tell him I know where his TARDIS is.\nMEL: Go-between duties again? Where is he?\nBLUE DOCTOR: Currently on the Mardak ship. But planning a return.\nMEL: If he’s up there-\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 122\nBLUE DOCTOR: (INTERRUPTING) No argument Mel. Go now!\nMEL: You haven’t completely lost your rude streak.\nBLUE DOCTOR: I’ve just learned to ask nicely - most of the time.\nMEL: (LEAVING) Good luck, Indigo.\nBLUE DOCTOR: I think I’ve just had some. I remember where Petherbridge\nBLUE DOCTOR: is.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 123\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 70: INT. MARDAK SHIP\nVANEESH: Nobody? Nobody has the vision to volunteer for this very unique opportunity?\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: I think your crew know when something’s too good to be true.\nKALLAK: That’s it, Vaneesh. If you’re risking my people, it’s my\nKALLAK: business. I’m relieving you of responsibility.\nVANEESH: You can’t do that. ‘Captain’.\nPETHERBRIDGE: Office politics bore me. I’1l have to hurry you.\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: What’s that alarm? Kallak?\nKALLAK: Our valanxium store — it’s destabilising!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 124\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 71: INT. ATC STATION\nJED: (FX: KNOCKING AND ENTERING) Hello..? You! You slipped them knots then?\nBLUE DOCTOR: Yes. I suppose I should thank you.\nJED: Thought Mr P was here? Where’s my Melanie?\nBLUE DOCTOR: (WORKING AT COMPUTER) She’s not your Melanie. You’ve known each other less than a day.\nJED: That ain’t right. You saw me get sprung. Weeks ago. Hid out in the woods... I... I...\nBLUE DOCTOR: This pocket only exists because I arrived twice over. You've been rewritten so many times, it just seems longer.\nJED: ‘Pocket’..?\nBLUE DOCTOR: Imagine the universe of space-time as a.. giant trampoline. This time-pocket is a tiny trampoline suspended slightly above the first. The weight of my Ships is like a.. cannonball. Stretching it. Weighing it down. Until the realities touch. And Mel is the pinpoint he’1ll use to rip through.\nJED: One question.\nBLUE DOCTOR: Yes.\nJED: What’s a trampoline?\nBLUE DOCTOR: Never mind. You brought the gunpowder?\nJED: Outside, sir.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 125\nBLUE DOCTOR: I need you to demolish the wall under the dish. While you’re doing that, think about your future.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 126\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 72: INT. MARDAK SHIP\nKALLAK: The readings are off the scale.\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: The valanxium’s disintegrating. You can’t form a cauterised timepocket without expending temporal energy. The toll must be paid.\nPETHERBRIDGE: How right you are. Here. Mardak.\nPETHERBRIDGE: (FX: GRABS DEEREK, WHO STRUGGLES AND SCREAMS AS NECK IS SNAPPED )\nPETHERBRIDGE: Down you go.\nVANEESH: He killed Deerek!\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: Snapped his neck and threw him down the Channel. To your pit.\nPETHERBRIDGE: That’s one. Two dozen still to pay...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 127\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 73: EXT. OUTSIDE ATC STATION\nYOUNG MEL: Jed?\nJED: My Melanie! Where’ve you been?\nYOUNG MEL: I- I’m not sure. What are you doing?\nJED: I think... it’s time I moved on.\nYOUNG MEL: Yes... it’s time for me too.\nJED: I’ve a family waiting to happen. I guess they won’t unless I go back.\nYOUNG MEL: We had... fun. At least I think we did.\nJED: Freedom’s all very well. But if it’s not real. If I can’t trust my memories... What’s the point?\nYOUNG MEL: You know where you should be.\nJED: I do, missy. Now, get inside. Gonna be a very big bang.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 128\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 74: INT. JED’S DEATHBED, VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA 1880\nBLUE DOCTOR: (V/O) Jedediah Thurwell. Born 1812. Transported to Victoria, Australia, 1849.\nJED: (FX: ECHOEY) Oh... This is where I was going. Yeah. I remember now...\nBLUE DOCTOR: (V/O) Worked his freedom. Married. Four children. Fifteen grandchildren.\nJED: If I’d never been caught, I’d never have come. Never met my Patsy.\nJED: Annie... that you, Sweetheart? Copper curls... Just like your grandmother. I’d move mountains for a redhead... Always would.\nJED: Grandpappy needs a sleep now... A long, long sleep.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 129\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 75: INT.

You, prattling Facilitator?\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: Close the Channel!\nKALLAK: I can’t!\nPETHERBRIDGE: Of course you can’t. I control passage through the vortex. Even your crude conduit.\nVANEESH: Just... shoot him!\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: It won’t work!\nVANEESH: Here- let me-\nPETHERBRIDGE: See. There is no effect- (FX: ECHO, DISTORT AND FLASH)\nVANEESH: No effect eh? He’s vapourised.\nKALLAK: What just happened?\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: At a guess. I think I might have stopped him.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 131\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 77: INT. BELOW DECKS, HMS GUERRIERE, 1812\nCAPTAIN: What the hell are you doing down here?

I’ve linked a sub-Channel to your storage hold.\nKALLAK: How did you- ?\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: (INTERRUPTING) I’m very clever.\nVANEESH: But... it’s worth a fortune!\nKALLAK: It’s the valanxium or us.

I’m a green guru in eight gamma business process methodology!\nKALLAK: He’s right. It’s just.. noises. (TO COMMS) Dump the valanxium! This project’s a write-off.

I’d have been proud to take you with me, Mel. We’d have had a wonderful future...\nBLUE DOCTOR: Don’t try to move. I’ve got you.\nYOUNG MEL: The future... I’ve forgotten what it means... ‘Future’? I know ‘now’. But what comes after... ‘now’?\nBLUE DOCTOR: (GENTLY) Don’t worry, I’1l1 explain... ‘later’.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 141\nYOUNG MEL: (WEAKENING) Doctor? I can’t see... anything. I saw everything before. It’s gone. Faded... to... nothing... (BEAT) I- I’m scared...\nBLUE DOCTOR: (QUIET) Mel? (BEAT) Mel?\nBLUE DOCTOR: (FX: LAYS HER DOWN GENTLY AND STANDS) ‘Last scene of all, That ends this strange eventful history,\nBLUE DOCTOR: Is second childishness and mere oblivion,\nBLUE DOCTOR: Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.’\nBLUE DOCTOR: Oh Mel... I’m so, so sorry.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 142\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 86: EXT. OUTSIDE ATC STATION\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: Well that thing’s never going to pick up The Archers again.\nMEL: Jed blew up the radar dish...\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: Oh, the original’s perfectly safe in the real 1987. But look what’s hidden underneath it.\nMEL: The TARDIS! And another one!\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: The weight of two TARDISes. The gravity well at the centre of things.\nBLUE DOCTOR: (OFF, EMERGING FROM ATC) Yes. I was right. He was using them to anchor this reality.\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: So, my future’s safe. Where’s mini-Mel?\nBLUE DOCTOR: (APPROACHING) Something you wanted to say to her?\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: I... misjudged her. I wanted to...\nBLUE DOCTOR: You’re too late. She’s.. gone back to her own timeline. Zipped off with a smile and a wave. Sends her best to you both.\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: Come on, Mel A. I still need to drop you off.\nBLUE DOCTOR: When you’ve done that, you should brush up on your history. There’s a lot it can teach you. I’d recommend the faculty at Sheffield Hallam.\nMEL: How do we tell the TARDISes apart?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 143\nMOTLEY DOCTOR: Where’s that redoubtable recall, Mel? This one’s ours. (FX: OPENING TARDIS DOOR) And as for you... Be you later. (EXITS)\nBLUE DOCTOR: I’m not as young as I was. Thank goodness.\nMEL: How did he know which was his?\nBLUE DOCTOR: He didn’t. He guessed. Bravado and bluster can only get you so far.. By the time he’s me, a few rough edges have been smoothed out.\nMEL: Yes. I remember. Do I have to go with him?\nBLUE DOCTOR: This pocket’s about to fade into the vortex. The TARDISes are the only things keeping it stable. You know where you’re supposed to be, young lady?\nMEL: Yes.\nBLUE DOCTOR: Then tell him!\nMEL: He won’t listen!\nBLUE DOCTOR: If anyone can make him — you can. Goodbye Mel. Or should I say, au revoir?\nMEL: Yes, I think you should. Déja vu, Doctor. I remember... everything. (WHISPERS) Thank you.\nMEL: (FX: TARDIS DOOR CLOSES, DEMATERIALISATION, GATHERING TIME WINDS )\nBLUE DOCTOR: There’s only one Melanie Bush... (REALISATION) ..who remembers\nBLUE DOCTOR: everything! Of course! How could I have been so stupid!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 144\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 87: INT. ATC STATION [CONTINUOUS]\nBLUE DOCTOR: No amount of jazzercise would enable Mel to knock herself out\nBLUE DOCTOR: with one punch. It was old Blinovitch after all.\nBLUE DOCTOR: This poor girl’s not dead — she’s been removed from time. Empty. But full of potential.\nBLUE DOCTOR: She’s the same Mel who’1ll travel in the TARDIS. But she’s been stolen from the present... Deleted!\nBLUE DOCTOR: I need to find the right memories from all these alternates to reconstruct the Mel who just left... Only, I can’t. I haven’t\nBLUE DOCTOR: even met you yet. But there’s someone... something... who can!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE WRONG DOCTORS by Matt Fitton Page 145\nDOCTOR WHO: Scene 88: INT. TARDIS, CONTROL ROOM [CONTINUOUS]\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: TARDIS B/G HUM. THE DOCTOR BURSTS IN FROM OUTSIDE, CLATTERING DROPPED MACHINERY )\nBLUE DOCTOR: The TARDIS!

(YAWNS) I can’t believe I nodded off!\nCHRISTINE: (CALLING FROM OFF) You’re not spending summer asleep on the\nCHRISTINE: sofa. Is that what you’ve learned at that university?\nYOUNG MEL: Coming, mum! (FX: MEOW) Now, how did you get here?\nBLUE DOCTOR: (V/O) Melanie Jane Bush. Born 1964. Computer programmer. Resident of Pease Pottage. And so much more.\nBLUE DOCTOR: I look forward to meeting you. (BEAT) But not... quite... yet.\nBLUE DOCTOR: END"
