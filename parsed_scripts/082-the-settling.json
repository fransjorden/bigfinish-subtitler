      "searchable_dialogue": "ACE: Hex? Hex? Where are you hiding? Ah, there you are. Oh, aren't you freezing? Hiya. Made you some tea.\nHEX: Cheers. You can sit down if you want.\nACE: I know what you're thinking. Why does the Tardis need its own mountain range. And don't be fooled by the view, they're real enough. Climbed the snowy one in the middle once. If you like we could go on an expedition. We've got all the right gear.\nHEX: I just wanted to be somewhere by myself.\nACE: Yeah, it's a good spot. Used to hide down this way when me and the Doctor had arguments. Back in my teens. Did you know we used to row all the time?\nHEX: Yeah, you said.\nACE: It's different now. He used to be so... Well, he used to take on the universe single-handed. Oh, real ego trip stuff. Small man's complex if you ask me. Is that a smile?\nHEX: I don't need cheering up, Ace. I just need time to think.\nACE: Yeah, it's been a tough one, this.\nHEX: I don't want to talk about it. Not yet. Thanks all the same.\nACE: Whatever you want. The Doctor will be back soon and then we'll be off again. Somewhere new. Somewhere better. Leave this one behind us.\nHEX: Yeah. Wish we'd never even come here.\nACE: Look, we can't undo what's done, Hex.\nHEX: Yeah, well, I'm kind of done with the history lessons, yeah?\nACE: Well, no need to bite my head off. Look, sorry.\nHEX: No, I'm sorry. I just can't get it out of me head. I keep on going over it all, you know, trying to sort it out. It's just a mess. Right from the moment we arrived here.\nACE: He said he wanted to teach you some practical skills.\nCASTLE: Faster, faster. They can repair the thing faster than this. (boom) Aim for the dent we've already made in it. Aim for the dent! Wilson, keep the rhythm going. We'll bring it down with a sound. (boom) Medic? Medic?\nHEX: It's all mud lanes, and the houses? I don't know, it could be medieval? There's thatched roofs, slate roofs over there. But did they have gardens and hedges and stuff back then?\nACE: Well, it's not the Palace of Thieves, but...\nDOCTOR: Ace? Hex has to learn this for himself, like you did.\nACE: I was just providing some context, like you did.\nDOCTOR: I see. That was good, Hex.\nHEX: So, did I pass then or what?\nACE: Hardly. You've missed two important things.\nHEX: Oh. Like what?\nACE: Use ail your senses. What can you hear?\nHEX: Is that thunder? We've got to find shelter.\nDOCTOR: Good thinking. But that's not thunder.\nACE: And the other thing? Sort of common in towns like this. Tends to be what towns are for?\nHEX: Er. Another clue, maybe?\nACE: People.\nHEX: But we haven't seen any... We haven't seen any people! Hello! Anyone about?\nDOCTOR: Hex! I don't know where you two get your bad habits.\nACE: We sat your course, didn't we?\nKIERAN: (breathless Irishman) Here.\nACE: See? The direct approach pays off again.\nKIERAN: Right. Er, any news?\nDOCTOR: Why? Where have you been?\nKIERAN: My wife. She's pregnant. I just wanted to make sure she was safe...\nDOCTOR: I've no time for excuses. What's your name, soldier?\nKIERAN: Kieran Fitzgerald, sir.\nHEX: Listen mate, why is no one about?\nACE: Hex!\nHEX: Well, you said be direct.\nDOCTOR: You'll have to forgive my students.\nKIERAN: Ah. Even us laymen are nervy. They say he shows no mercy. You're some kind of monks?\nDOCTOR: The town kindly took us in.\nKIERAN: Ah well, we've a common enemy.\nHEX: We have?\nKIERAN: You may be forbidden from fighting, boy, but you'll be with us in spirit against that monster.\nACE: We could be just what you need. We're good with monsters.\nKIERAN: There's no stopping him, Miss. Oh. It's stopped.\nACE: What? What's stopped?\nDOCTOR: What can you hear?\nACE: I can't hear anything.\nHEX: Exactly. The thunder's stopped.\nDOCTOR: It wasn't thunder.\nKIERAN: It's stopped! Come on!\nACE: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Why not? Let's find out where we are, shall we?\nHEX: Do you think he knew? Do you think he knew where he'd brought us?\nACE: I can't believe he did it on purpose. Ah, but there was this time with me once. He took me to this old house. No, he knows better than that these days.\nHEX: But of all the places to end up. We could have landed ten miles away, or ten years, and it would have been all fine. But he lands us right in the thick of it.\nACE: I reckon the Tardis latches onto hot spots in history. You know, events so big they affect the Vortex. That's why we always end up where stuff's happening.\nHEX: Like moths to a flame?\nACE: Huh, that's it. And sometimes we get... I was going to say, we get burnt. You know what I mean, though.\nHEX: I suppose a time machine's got to have a sense of timing. But to land us bang in the middle of a siege? It was awful.\nHEX: I can't see what's happ... Oh! It's a siege. Cool!\nDOCTOR: The fog is limestone dust, where the town's walls have been bombarded.\nKIERAN: But it's stopped! It's over!\nDOCTOR: I very much doubt that.\nACE: They're about to attack. There we go. Is that the best they can do?\nKIERAN: Ah, he's a lunatic. Does he think he'll get past us with just three units?\nDOCTOR: He will.\nKIERAN: Ah, rubbish. They don't stand a chance.\nDOCTOR: I think it's time we got back to the Tardis.\nACE: So, you know where we are, do you, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: This is Drogheda.\nHEX: Drogheda?\nDOCTOR: The army out there is being led by one Oliver Cromwell.\nHEX: My Nan used to tell me. It's going to be a massacre, isn't it?\nKIERAN: It is, boy. They don't stand a chance.\nACE: What is it, Doctor? Where are we?\nDOCTOR: Ireland in 1649. That's right, isn't it, Hex?\nHEX: Ace, it's one of the worst atrocities in Irish history. You must have heard of Cromwell?\nACE: Yeah, course I have. Cut the King's head off, didn't he?\nKIERAN: He's a monster.\nHEX: You don't know the half of it, mate.\nCASTLE: Charge!\nCROMWELL: Goddard? Goddard! Where is the bloody man?\nGODDARD: I'm sorry, Lord General, my ears are still ringing from the guns. How can I help, sir?\nCROMWELL: Wanted to make sure you were ready. Expect brisk trade today. You'll make a killing.\nGODDARD: I'll leave that to you if I may, sir. Yes, surgery's ready. Boys with the stretchers are already out there.\nCROMWELL: Good. (sigh) It's started. Look after them, Goddard.\nGODDARD: We will, sir. It'll be all right.\nCROMWELL: Yes. Yes, of course. I mean, how can we possibly fail?\nHEX: But I know about this. I know what happened.\nDOCTOR: The history lesson is over, Hex. It's time to leave.\nKIERAN: You should have been evacuated days ago.\nDOCTOR: We're leaving now.\nHEX: No.\nDOCTOR: Hex?\nHEX: We have to help them.\nACE: He's right, Doctor. We can't run away from this.\nDOCTOR: You know I wouldn't insist if it wasn't important.\nACE: Tell us, then. Why can't we stay?\nDOCTOR: For theological reasons we wouldn't want to bother these lay people with. There's nothing we can do.\nACE: There's always something. You taught me that.\nHEX: We can't leave. It wouldn't be right.\nDOCTOR: This isn't the time to debate ethics.\nKIERAN: Doctor, we appreciate you're a man of conscience, bound by your beliefs. But we didn't start this war.\nDOCTOR: We can't fight beside you, Kieran. I wish I could explain.\nKIERAN: You've heard what English soldiers do to the women they conquer.\nDOCTOR: I know what soldiers can be like.\nKIERAN: Isn't that worth fighting against? My wife Mary. We couldn’t get her out of the town. She's pregnant, and now she's alone.\nDOCTOR: As long as she stays out of sight she'll be fine.\nKIERAN: Ha. That's what worries me. I think she'll try and join in the fighting.\nDOCTOR: Ah. You want me to stay with her?\nKIERAN: Please. You wouldn't have to fight. And if anything should happen to me...\nDOCTOR: I'll see that she's safe. I promise.\nKIERAN: Thank you.\nDOCTOR: And you two.\nACE: We're staying, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Fine. But you are not to fight. Whatever happens, don't even pick up a weapon. Understood?\nHEX: Yes, Doctor.\nACE: Anything you say.\nDOCTOR: Ace? You're responsible for Hex.\nHEX: I don't need a babysitter.\nDOCTOR: Do whatever she tells you, and I'll see you both soon. (leaves)\nHEX: Look, I don't understand. He could be doing something here. He could help us.\nKIERAN: Ah, it's not easy for any of us, this. The whole world's turned upside-down. How do we make a stand against that, huh?\nACE: Give me a gun.\nHEX: Ace? You promised.\nACE: Not to fight. To defend myself. You heard what they do to women.\nKIERAN: Okay.\nHEX: But the Doctor...\nACE: First thing I learnt was never to listen to him. Always telling us not to get involved. But like you said, what does he do all the time?\nKIERAN: Yes! That's it!\nACE: They're retreating?\nKIERAN: We've beaten them off. I told you we would.\nHEX: No, but it can't be. This isn’t what happened.\nACE: You and the Doctor both knew what happened. I should have listened to you. Aren't you freezing?\nHEX: No.\nACE: Grew up with it always this cold, yeah?\nHEX: Yeah, yeah, you southern wuss.\nACE: Hmm. Another smile. You want to watch that. It was my fault, Hex.\nHEX: It wouldn’t have made any difference. It had already begun.\nMARY: I've got a gun.\nDOCTOR: So you've got nothing to fear from me then, have you? Your husband sent me, to see you safe.\nMARY: I'm perfectly all right.\nDOCTOR: He cares, that's all. Hello, Mary. I'm the Doctor.\nMARY: I don't need another midwife, thank you.\nDOCTOR: I'm glad to hear it. May I sit down?\nMARY: Do what you like.\nDOCTOR: Well, This is pleasant. I like what you've done with the candles.\nMARY: I suppose you want a mug of beer or something?\nDOCTOR: No, but thanks for asking.\nMARY: We haven't got any, anyway.\nDOCTOR: Ah. Never mind. Well, this is pleasant.\nGODDARD: Excuse the mess, sir. We're making them as comfortable as we can.\nCROMWELL: How many have been lost?\nGODDARD: Oh, most of the wounded won't last. We've had seventeen dead here so far, including Captain Castle.\nCROMWELL: Castle? Oh, what have I done?\nGODDARD: Leading his men into the fray, they said. Shot in the face. It would have been quick.\nCROMWELL: Oh, damn it!\nGODDARD: Don't blame yourself, Oliver. Maybe you just took too much on.\nCROMWELL: Oh no, that can't be it. I should have had more faith. We're meant to win this! Right. Men, we owe it to Castle to see this through. We're going again. This time, we're a// going! And no mercy to anyone who tries to stop us!\nHEX: Ace, this is a really bad idea.\nACE: We should be where the action is, Hex. See history right as it happens. Don't be such a big girl.\nKIERAN: Ah, there's no point in arguing, lad. Women always do what they want to anyway.\nACE: There speaks the married man. Come on. I want to be able to see the enemy.\nHEX: This is a really bad idea. If this is Drogheda like the Doctor says, then the army...\nKIERAN: Yes, this is Drogheda. There's something happening. Stay here.\nKIERAN: Man the barricades! Man the barricades!\nACE: They're coming again!\nHEX: Oh my God!\nDOCTOR: The fighting's started again. I shouldn't have left them.\nMARY: The barricades will hold. They have to.\nDOCTOR: I wish I shared your confidence. My friends, about your age, not much more than children.\nMARY: Worth fighting for.\nDOCTOR: That never solves anything. It's always the diplomats and the peacemakers who have to clear up the mess.\nMARY: It's the only thing some people understand.\nDOCTOR: You believe that?\nMARY: We didn't start this, did we? The King killer, he's the one to blame.\nDOCTOR: Of course. You grew up here, you and your husband?\nMARY: Yeah. Me and him and... You’ve changed the subject.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Do you mind?\nMARY: No. It's better than thinking about...\nDOCTOR: That's what I thought as well. You've known Kieran since you were both children?\nMARY: Well, yeah. We were both in the same parish, weren't we? And our mothers knew each other. And you know what a place like this can be like.\nHEX: Ace, we've got to get out of here.\nACE: We can't let this lot into the town.\nHEX: It isn't our fight.\nKIERAN: They just keep coming.\nHEX: We've got to get out of here now!\nKIERAN: We're doing no good up here anyway. Come on!\nMARY: And his brother is... Well, you know what they say about twins.\nDOCTOR: They only get half the birthday presents.\nMARY: They're bad luck.\nDOCTOR: You don't believe that, do you?\nMARY: Well, of course not. But the fighting's getting closer.\nDOCTOR: You don't have to tell me if you don't want to.\nMARY: No, it's... You won't tell anyone, will you?\nDOCTOR: I promise. Mary, you can tell me anything.\nKIERAN: If we can get back across the river...\nHEX: I know what's going to happen.\nACE: Hex, keep up! Oh, damn it, the Doctor was right. Which means we'll never hear the end of it.\nKIERAN: Look out! Grenade!\nMARY: He just didn't like it when Kieran and I... James was envious, I think.\nDOCTOR: It's not uncommon. If the two brothers were close, then...\nMARY: They used to finish each other's sentences. And they'd laugh at the same things without having to say a word. James really made an effort when they first began to...\nDOCTOR: So what changed?\nMARY: We... I hardly know you! I'm terrified what you'll think of me.\nDOCTOR: It doesn't matter what I think.\nMARY: Well... James, he left town, you know. Broke his mother's heart and she's never forgiven me for that. And Kieran's beside himself about it.\nDOCTOR: And what did you do, Mary?\nMARY: We, well... Oh, I have no one to talk to, to explain what it was like.\nDOCTOR: You can tell me.\nCROMWELL: Get some guns up here! I want half-pounders! That cavalry needs taking out. Get a move on!\nROBERTS: You shouldn't be so near the front line, sir.\nCROMWELL: Thank you, Roberts, but I'll not hide behind you. We've got to do right by Captain Castle. Vengeance!\nACE: Kieran!\nKIERAN: Ah, I'm fine. Really. Come on, we should... Where's Hex?\nACE: Hex? Hex! Oh, I promised I'd look after him. Hex!\nKIERAN: We'll have to go back for him.\nSOLDIER: Stopped running have we, ladies?\nACE: Keep back.\nSOLDIER: Got a live one here, lads.\nKIERAN: She said to keep back.\nSOLDIER: Gonna take us all on, are you?\nACE: Give me a sword, and yes.\nACE: It's my fault. If I'd been paying more attention...\nHEX: Or if I'd have been looking where I was going...\nACE: I was meant to be looking after you...\nHEX: I never needed a babysitter.\nACE: I promised the Doctor.\nHEX: Yeah, well, we promised him a lot of stuff, didn't we? He told us not to fight.\nHEX: Oh my God. Oh, God. God, where are you, Ace?\nTURNER: You there. No use hiding. Come out where I can see you.\nHEX: Oh God. Look, I'm not going to fight ya.\nTURNER: You an Irishman?\nHEX: No. Yeah. Look, it doesn't matter, I won't fight ya.\nTURNER: Oh. Oh, right. Look, look, I'm sorry, but I'll, I'll just have to be done with you anyway.\nHEX: No, wait.\nCROMWELL: Turner, go and pick on someone your own size.\nTURNER: Oh, General. Yes, sir. (leaves)\nHEX: He was going to, to...\nCROMWELL: Yes, it's all right, boy. You should be proud of your convictions. There's not many who could make a stand like that.\nHEX: You're... you're... Oliver Cromwell.\nCROMWELL: (sighs) It's the warts, isn't it? Yes, everyone's always heard about the warts.\nMARY: We married as soon I knew I was pregnant.\nDOCTOR: I'm not here to judge you, Mary.\nMARY: Huh! You'd be the first. It was the night we heard, you know, about what they'd done to the King. They murdered him, and then they made out it had been God's will. It was a terrible night. All of us just broken up by the news that they'd actually done it. How can something like that be allowed to happen? The priest said it meant the Devil had come to take over the Earth.\nDOCTOR: So you reached out for someone. Who could blame you for that?\nMARY: It was just that night, that one night. But what we did, they're saying, it's what's brought this on us. That my baby's cursed.\nDOCTOR: People can be cruel. That's why you're hidden away here, is it? Why you weren't evacuated?\nMARY: Kieran says I should try to be invisible.\nDOCTOR: A town has to focus its prejudice on the enemy.\nMARY: Yeah. I'm bad luck for everyone. You watch yourself.\nDOCTOR: I'll be fine. We'll be fine. I promise you.\nROBERTS: [OC]: Open up in there!\nMARY: They're here.\nKIERAN: Ace, behind you!\nACE: Won't get by me. Captain of Cleopatra's guard?\nKIERAN: Oh.\nACE: He's a friend of a friend.\nKIERAN: Oh, I see.\nACE: Best swordsman I ever met.\nKIERAN: Oh.\nACE: Taught me everything he knew.\nKIERAN: Okay. Ah!\nACE: As well as the fencing, I do a mean beef casserole.\nSOLDIER: Oh, I've had enough of this.\nACE: Ow! That's cheating!\nJENKINS: Just isolated pockets now, sir. There's some men hiding in a church.\nCROMWELL: Burn it down, Jenkins. No mercy to anyone who resists us.\nJENKINS: Sir.\nHEX: You can't just kill ‘em all.\nCROMWELL: It has to be done. They won't learn otherwise. What's your name, lad?\nHEX: Hex.\nCROMWELL: What sort of a name's that? Are you a witch?\nHEX: No.\nCROMWELL: Well, hear that, lads? Looks like we've got ourselves a witch.\nCOOTE: Want us to string him up, sir?\nHEX: I'm not a witch.\nCROMWELL: You're an idiot, Chidley Coote. We don't string up witches, do we?\nCOOTE: No, sir. Sorry, sir.\nHEX: Thank you.\nCROMWELL: We burn them at the stake."

They've been ordered to kill anyone who resists them.\nMARY: You're joking.\nDOCTOR: Think of your baby. Good girl. You can come in now.\nROBERTS: Well, what have we here, then?\nDOCTOR: Please, she's pregnant. We won't give you any trouble.\nROBERTS: Too right you won't.\nDOCTOR: Please.\nDOCTOR: Ow!\nMARY: Doctor!\nROBERTS: Don't worry about him, love. You're the one that's in trouble.\nHEX: I'm not that religious, but seeing a church on fire? Well, it's just wrong.\nACE: And Cromwell the man of God.\nHEX: So many people dead. You hear thousands dead, and you think you understand it. But being there? It's nothing like you see on the News. There's bodies everywhere you look. Their guts are all over the street.\nACE: You never forget the smell.\nHEX: They were saying he was a monster when we arrived. But it was people did that. People doing it to other people.\nACE: Cold?\nHEX: Freezing. Is there any more tea?\nACE: I'll have to make another pot. Come on, you. Tardis kitchen. We can make some toast as well.\nACE: You see? You are feeling better. It's going to be fine. Something like this, well, it takes time, that's all.\nHEX: You think? You should have seen what it did to Cromwell.\nCROMWELL: Got you! (laughs)\nHEX: You what?\nCROMWELL: Dear me. No such thing as witches, is there?\nHEX: You, you were joking?\nCROMWELL: Oh, yes. It was only a bit of fun.\nHEX: You’re massacring the town.\nCROMWELL: Yes. Well, maybe it wasn't exactly appropriate. (receding) Right, I want the town secure. Search every building and we'll need a headquarters.\nHEX: I don't believe this.\nACE: I couldn't believe him either. Still don't know what to make of him. The Doctor's met loads of famous people from history. Name drops them all the time. But if you ask him what they were like - Caesar or Nelson or William Tell - he just says, oh, you know.\nHEX: Yeah, and he gets all evasive again, his mysterious thing.\nACE: That's it. Always thought he did it just to be annoying, or to get me to read stuff. Er, where are we?\nHEX: In mezzanine... It's one of the mezzanines. So the kitchen's up this way. Left, I think.\nACE: Oh yeah. Wish he wouldn't keep moving things around. Anyway, Cromwell.\nHEX: You never said what you made of him.\nACE: No.\nHEX: Something bad, yeah?\nACE: Well, it wasn't like with you.\nHEX: Well, while I was with him, you and Kieran? Well, what happened? You're covered in bruises too, Ace.\nACE: I made a mistake. I fought.\nSOLDIER: Throw down the weapons and we'll let you live.\nKIERAN: Swear you won't hurt her.\nSOLDIER: Of course. If you drop the gun.\nACE: Best do as he wants, yeah? It'll be okay.\nKIERAN: Okay.\nSOLDIER: Good lad.\nACE: Kieran! You killed him! He wasn't even armed.\nSOLDIER: Yeah, there's no trusting this lot, is there?\nACE: Keep back! Oh, Hex, I'm sorry.\nSOLDIER: No use crying about it. No one's going to save you this time.\nACE: How many spoon's worth of tea leaves is it? I can never remember.\nHEX: One for each of us, and one for the pot. But don't put them in yet. Let the water boil first.\nACE: And then, what, warm the pot or something?\nHEX: That's it. Here, let me.\nACE: Make a lot of teas on Earth, did you?\nHEX: No, we have nursing assistants for that. But I was a student once. People coming and going in the hall all hours of the day, so we always had the kettle on.\nACE: Students making tea in a teapot. Mmm, fancy.\nHEX: Hey, it's better that way, and cheaper. Anyway, you were telling me about Drogheda.\nACE: What's there to say?\nHEX: Well, Cromwell didn't want women and children getting hurt.\nACE: Yeah, well, think the soldiers were too busy to remember their manners.\nMARY: Ah! Leave me alone!\nROBERTS: Ow! How’d you like it if I threw a potty at you? Covered you in poo.\nDOCTOR: Soldier?\nROBERTS: Pardon my French. I thought I’d dealt with you.\nDOCTOR: What has Cromwell said about abusing country persons?\nROBERTS: Well, yeah, but...\nDOCTOR: Only the other week he hanged two of his own men, and they'd merely stolen some chickens.\nROBERTS: Well, yeah, but... Oh!\nDOCTOR: Mary, in your condition you shouldn't be hurling chairs about.\nMARY: He could have killed us.\nDOCTOR: Cromwell's a great one for discipline, and very strict about how civilians are treated.\nMARY: Do you think Kieran, and, and your friends will be fine?\nDOCTOR: We'll let the fighting quieten down a bit, and then we'll go and find them.\nCROMWELL: Get on your feet, man! I want that building down, and make sure the bridge is guarded. Clean up the roadway there.\nJENKINS: Keep up, lad. I'll drag you if I have to.\nHEX: Okay, okay. Doctor, I should have listened.\nGODDARD: I'm the Doctor round here. Jonathan Goddard. It's Hex, isn't it?\nHEX: Hi. Must be tough for ya, all this. I mean, you're not a soldier.\nGODDARD: I've been well out of the fighting. Only dared to report to himself now the fighting's done.\nHEX: Yeah, but you're a doctor. That's like the opposite to all this lot. They turned the town into an abattoir.\nGODDARD: Hadn't quite thought about it like that before. You're some kind of doctor too?\nHEX: I'm a nurse. Don't laugh.\nGODDARD: Very honourable profession, nursing, for a spinster.\nHEX: Now, hey, what's with everyone taking the mickey?\nGODDARD: (laughing) And you nearly got burnt at the stake. Cromwell... Oh well, it's the pressure that gets to him. Should have seen him signing the King's death warrant. Mucking about like some naughty schoolboy.\nCROMWELL: Is that Goddard? Bring the lad up here, will you? Something I want him to see.\nGODDARD: Come on, best do as he says.\nMARY: Ah! They've killed everyone. Everyone.\nDOCTOR: Careful, Mary. Not so fast.\nMARY: I have to find my husband.\nDOCTOR: And I'll come with you, but let's not rush. The soldiers are still jumpy.\nMARY: Your friends will have been killed too.\nDOCTOR: We don't know anything for certain yet, do we?\nMARY: But look at it all. Look at what they've done.\nDOCTOR: They'll have been safe as long as they did what I told them. Just this once.\nHEX: Okay, what do you want to show me? Oh.\nCROMWELL: These men had a half-hearted go at us, but we've taken their weapons away. They're harmless.\nHEX: And you want me to see you execute them?\nPRISONER: Please. Mercy.\nHEX: Look, you've butchered thousands of men already, Cromwell. Ireland's going to curse the name of Oliver Cromwell for years, for centuries.\nCROMWELL: Good. You. What's the next town along that road?\nPRISONER: 2: Er. Dundalk, sir.\nCROMWELL: You think I should let them go?\nHEX: Yes.\nCROMWELL: All right, then. Go!\nPRISONER: Thank you, sir. Thank you.\nHEX: I don't understand.\nCROMWELL: No. Evidently not.\nDOCTOR: Mary, you shouldn't get so close to the bodies. It's not good for your baby.\nMARY: But I won't find Kieran if I don't look.\nDOCTOR: I can for him for you. You don't need to see any of this.\nMARY: Oh, it isn't possible. So many dead.\nWOMAN: Your husband's down that way, Mary Fitzgerald.\nMARY: What? You've seen him?\nDOCTOR: Come on. We'll go and look. I'm sorry.\nMARY: (crying) Oh, no! No, no, no!\nDOCTOR: He must have fought back. He must have died trying to protect my friends.\nMARY: What, what is it?\nDOCTOR: Ace? Oh no. Ace.\nHEX: But it's so random. Why just let some of them live?\nCROMWELL: I'm not quite the monster you think, Hex. Chidley Coote!\nCOOTE: Sir.\nCROMWELL: Follow those men up to Dundalk. Take a couple of regiments of horse and other on foot. Nothing too pushy. But give this note to the town's Chief Officer.\nCOOTE: Sir.\nHEX: You think Dundalk’ll just surrender?\nCROMWELL: They might even abandon the town. It really depends how much they believe what they're told by those men I let live. What's next? Goddard!\nGODDARD: Sir.\nCROMWELL: This town's done. Pack up the hospital. Be ready to move at first light.\nHEX: You're moving out?\nCROMWELL: We are moving out, Mister Hex. I want to be off by first light.\nHEX: Right. Yeah. No rest for the wick...\nCROMWELL: Yes?\nHEX: The righteous.\nCROMWELL: (laughs) No, lad. He wouldn't want us getting bored, would He?\nHEX: Who?\nGODDARD: Come on, Hex, I could use your help.\nDOCTOR: It's all right. I've got you.\nACE: Doctor. Hex was ... Hex...\nDOCTOR: Tell me what happened. What did they do to you?\nACE: Should have killed me too. Of all the sexist, stupid things.\nDOCTOR: You fought? I told you not to fight.\nACE: I know. I'm sorry. But they were killing everyone.\nDOCTOR: And all by the rules of war too. The town didn't surrender, so every man's life was forfeit. Come on. Got to find Hex.\nACE: Doctor, they'll have killed him.\nDOCTOR: Yes. But we should still try to find his body.\nCOOTE: For the Chief Officer Commanding in Dundalk. Sir, I offered mercy to the garrison in Drogheda, and sent the Governor a summons before I attempted taking it. They refused us, and brought evil upon themselves. Be warned. If you surrender your garrison to the Parliament of England as I summon you to do now, you will prevent the same effusion of blood. We don't want what befalls you if you refuse, but you will be the ones to blame. Signed, Oliver Cromwell, 12th September 1649. What's your answer?\nJAMES: We surrender.\nGODDARD: Any clean bandages go in that box. We can't squander supplies, we're poorly stocked as it is.\nHEX: I wouldn't want to get sick round 'ere, would you? I thought the army was supposed to be better equipped. You know, support the men who are dying for ya.\nGODDARD: You'd think. Should have seen the arguments Cromwell had just to get everyone paid. He's the reason they fight, you know. Knows the name of every man under him. They'd follow him anywhere. How much of the war back home did you see?\nHEX: Not much, to be honest. The Doct... my Doctor, kept us out of it.\nGODDARD: You're lucky. Like you said, surgeons are the opposite of fighting men. All we can do is try and patch 'em up again.\nHEX: So you can't agree with the campaign here, then.\nCROMWELL: Oh, he doesn't have to agree with it, so long as he does as he's told. How are you doing?\nGODDARD: Just the tent to take down now I think, sir. Usually leave that to your finest.\nCROMWELL: Good. I've brought us a bottle to see off the day. I think we've earned it. Exactly what's needed. Here.\nGODDARD: Ta. (coughs) You've broken out the good stuff, sir. Hex?\nCROMWELL: Not too righteous to drink with us, are you?\nHEX: I'll have a swig.\nACE: Oh, nothing, nothing!\nDOCTOR: It'll be light before long. We'll find him, Ace. However long it takes, we'll find him.\nACE: We're not very welcome here, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: What makes you say that?\nACE: The other women. They say things about us, just out of hearing. They were doing it to Mary too.\nDOCTOR: They think her baby's cursed.\nACE: How can anyone believe that?\nDOCTOR: I know that, but Mary's all on her own now and I promised her that I'd look after\nACE: Shh, here she comes.\nMARY: They've seen him. They've seen him alive.\nDOCTOR: Kieran's dead, Mary. We saw his body.\nMARY: No, no, your friend. He's gone with the army.\nACE: Oh, thank God.\nMARY: They're saying Cromwell's got him right by his side.\nDOCTOR: That's... Oh. I guess it's good.\nACE: Explains people talking about us, doesn't it? But what's so special about Hex?\nDOCTOR: Let's just be grateful. We're obliged to you, Mary. What will you do now?\nMARY: I can't stay here. No one will have me.\nDOCTOR: You said Kieran had a brother out of town?\nMARY: I can't go to him. He lives down in Wexford.\nDOCTOR: Wexford?\nACE: What's wrong? Oh, that's where Cromwell's headed next, isn't it?\nDOCTOR: Yes. It's another bloody massacre.\nACE: But that's great!\nDOCTOR: What?\nACE: Don't you get it? We drop her off, and at the same time pick up Hex.\nACE: I thought it would be simple. A quick in-out job.\nHEX: Yeah, well, things never go to plan.\nACE: Oh, you have learned something then. So you and Cromwell chatted into the night. What'd you talk about?\nHEX: Well, you know. We were drunk.\nCROMWELL: Then in 1641, they attacked all the Protestants. No warning, no mercy. They just cut down thousands of women and children. We heard terrible stories back in England, more terrible than anything in the war.\nHEX: So this is all about revenge, then? Me gran said it was all...\nCROMWELL: No, no. No. No. But these people... The King's eldest is looking for any hold he can, and they're offering themselves up to him. We can't let him have Ireland.\nHEX: You're making out like it's some great crusade. But I saw your thugs, what they did to the town.\nCROMWELL: Look, I don't enjoy any of this. Sending the men into battle, and seeing them hacked to pieces. They're good lads. Better than most of the nobles I've ever known. They're the ones worth fighting for.\nHEX: They butchered the garrison.\nCROMWELL: On my orders.\nHEX: Oh, come on, that's never an excuse. Look, it was wrong to do it and it was wrong to tell them to do it. It was wrong, Cromwell.\nCROMWELL: There's a bigger picture, Hex, and my men aren't brutes. We have discipline. There's no swearing, no thieving...\nHEX: Oh, except from the Irish.\nCROMWELL: Oh, that's simply not fair. We pay for our board and lodgings. We will continue to do so. We're not like any other army in history. A New Model for a new age. And the Irish? Well, they understand that. That's why we've so many fighting alongside us.\nHEX: What? Maybe a few have come over to ya, out of terror over what you'll do to them otherwise.\nCROMWELL: What we've done here will save lives.\nHEX: Oh, yeah. Yeah, the country will just roll over for you now, eh? Don't you get it? Whatever you say, you can't make it right. You can't justify wholesale slaughter on moral grounds.\nCROMWELL: No one really expects me to win Ireland, Hex, you do know that?\nHEX: Well, Parliament must do.\nCROMWELL: Parliament wanted me out of the country. Got too big for my boots, didn't I? No man's ever made a success of Ireland. You've heard of the Earl of Essex?\nHEX: No.\nCROMWELL: Oh, great man. Great history. Until he came to Ireland. Went back to Queen Elizabeth utterly ruined. That could be me if I don't settle this quickly. It was brave of you to shout at me.\nHEX: I, er, I didn't mean to be rude.\nCROMWELL: No, no. I like a man with convictions. The higher I've risen, the harder it is to find anyone who'll question me.\nHEX: No offence, but you are pretty scary.\nCROMWELL: yes, and I've a terrible temper too. But I think you can make a difference.\nHEX: My friends’ll be worried. They'll come looking for me.\nCROMWELL: Until they do, help me be a better man. Help me settle Ireland more peaceably. What do you say?\nHEX: What could I say? I felt I could change history.\nACE: Easier said than done though, isn't it?\nHEX: Yeah. Great toast, by the way.\nACE: It's a gift.\nMARY: But I can't go all the way to Wexford. I'll be due before we get there.\nDOCTOR: It's going to be fine. We know a good shortcut.\nACE: So, have you thought of any names yet?\nMARY: Not yet. I didn't want to tempt fate. Not more than I have done already.\nACE: Names are important. I had a real time of it as a kid, being bullied about my name.\nMARY: What is your name?\nACE: Dorothy.\nMARY: But that's a nice name.\nDOCTOR: It's Greek, means the gift of God.\nACE: Does it? My Mum loved The Wizard Of Oz.\nDOCTOR: So do I. Astute woman, that Audrey McShane.\nMARY: All names have meanings. I'll probably choose something loyal to the King. Charles The Second, I mean.\nDOCTOR: Here we are.\nMARY: You keep supplies in this, for our journey?\nACE: Yeah, sort of. So, what names would mean loyalty?\nDOCTOR: Charles obviously for a boy. For a girl, Elizabeth would say monarchy, though, it's also a favourite of the Puritans.\nDOCTOR: Cromwell's wife, his mother and his favourite daughter are all called Elizabeth.\nACE: Mmn,, that's be diplomatic, then.\nACE: Oh. Yeah. Mary, should have warned you about this place.\nDOCTOR: Yes, it's all right. You'll be safe in here.\nACE: Yeah, but mind the mess. We've been redecorating it.\nMARY: I can feel it. I can feel it all at peace. It's like, like a church. Do you worship here?\nDOCTOR: Not exactly. It's our home. Ace, this is going to be tricky. I could do with your help at the console.\nACE: Oh, right. Releasing the handbrake.\nHEX: So don't gloat about it, yeah? Let them keep some pride.\nCROMWELL: Pride's what got them into this mess. They need to show humility.\nHEX: And they are, sir. They're surrendering to you.\nCROMWELL: Still taken long enough about it. Oh, fine, fine. We'll allow them some dignity.\nJAMES: Lord General. Thank you for seeing me.\nHEX: Kieran?\nCROMWELL: You know this man?\nJAMES: I... Not quite. I'm James. You've met my brother?\nHEX: We were at Drogheda together. He was the one I told you about, sir.\nCROMWELL: I see.\nJAMES: He's dead, isn't he? We heard what happened.\nHEX: I'm sorry. I don't know for sure. He was with another friend of mine, and we got separated. But I've not\nHEX: heard from her either, which must mean...\nJAMES: We heard what you did there, Cromwell.\nCROMWELL: Well, they brought it on themselves. We offered the same very reasonable terms we've offered you. Show Parliament some obedience, and you avoid the same fate.\nJAMES: Colonel Sinnot is eager to assure you, sir, that you have our obedience.\nCROMWELL: I'm very glad to hear it.\nJAMES: However, in his duty to the townspeople, he also needs your guarantee on some small points.\nCROMWELL: Dictating terms again, is he?\nHEX: What does he want, James?\nJAMES: There are ten resolutions here. But I think you'll agree that they're all reasonable...\nCROMWELL: (laughs) You didn't really expect to get any of this, did you?\nJAMES: Colonel Sinnot said that this was important, sir.\nCROMWELL: Oh look, Colonel Sinnot does not dictate to Parliament!\nHEX: The Lord General needs time to consider these requests, James. He will answer you shortly.\nCROMWELL: Free liberty to carry away artillery, arms and powder? Well, that's not obedience, that's your Colonel looking to surrender today and then fight with us again tomorrow!\nHEX: Please, Lord General, we can sort all this out, yeah? James, I'll show you somewhere you can wait while we work out a reply.\nJAMES: You're very kind. Lord General.\nDOCTOR: Ah, isn't it a lovely morning.\nACE: I'm soaked. You could have landed us a bit nearer the town. Now, if you'd let me set the coordinates like I wanted to.\nDOCTOR: The walk will do us good.\nACE: I was thinking of Mary? You should be keeping warm and toasty inside somewhere.\nMARY: No, I'm fine, really. I feel better to be out of the town.\nDOCTOR: Good. We're nearly there anyway. Just over this hill.\nACE: That's what you said about the last hill. We've walked miles.\nDOCTOR: Well, nobody's perfect. But what did I tell you? Wexford, the harbour, the town. Oh.\nACE: The whopping great army camped on the doorstep.\nMARY: They can't have overtaken us.\nACE: You said they'd take weeks to get here.\nDOCTOR: Well. Well, they should have done. We must have lost some time along the way. Still, they're not fighting yet. That's something.\nACE: We can't take Mary into there.\nDOCTOR: Certainly not. Ace, you run ahead and fetch out Mary's brother-in-law. We'll edge up to the camp, see if we can find some shelter.\nACE: And Hex.\nDOCTOR: And Hex? Oh, I'm sure he'll be fine.\nACE: Right. What's Kieran's brother look like?\nMARY: Just like him. James Fitzgerald, his name is.\nACE: Right.\nDOCTOR: Find him and come straight back. No dawdling.\nACE: Anything you say, Doctor. I have done this before, you know.\nDOCTOR: Ace, I don't want to lose both of you.\nACE: You must have thought you'd lost us.\nHEX: I knew you'd come looking for me if you could. But the longer it went. Well, figured a lot of people had died in Drogheda.\nACE: And we were among them.\nHEX: It made more sense, didn't it? Not like you'd rush off into the Tardis without me, head off somewhere else. At least, I thought not.\nACE: We thought we'd get to you earlier. It was my idea.\nHEX: But you know what the Tardis is like. Drawn to the next hot-spot in history. Doesn't matter. I thought I was doing okay, making the best of things. The best of things. That's a joke, innit?\nHEX: He's gone.\nCROMWELL: Ah, good work, Hex. Come over by the fire. Have a drink.\nGODDARD: You really think it's over?\nHEX: Well, it's got be, hasn't it? What else can they do?\nGODDARD: Oh good. We need to get out of this mud.\nHEX: Not one for the outdoors, Doctor? Roughing it's probably good for ya.\nCROMWELL: While you've been enjoying the diplomatic life, Master Schofield, Goddard has had the men to\nCROMWELL: look after.\nHEX: But we're not fighting.\nGODDARD: No. There's nothing for them to do. Except die, of course.\nHEX: I don't understand.\nCROMWELL: We have something of a problem with dysentery.\nHEX: Well, there's things you can do though, isn't there? There's lots of fluids, better sanitation. I'm guessing you don't have antimicrobials.\nGODDARD: We need not to be stuck in this bog. We need to be inside the town.\nCROMWELL: And we will be, one way or the other.\nJAMES: We're running out of time, sir.\nSINNOT: There's no rush, James. He'll understand an hour's no time at all, to agree which officers in Alderman we're sending.\nJAMES: Colonel Sinnot, he's serious. He's agreed pretty much all that we ask for, but we can't mess around.\nSINNOT: He needs the town and harbour intact. If we just keep stalling him, Ormonde will get here, and we'll have an army. What is it?\nMESSENGER: Sorry to disturb you, sir. Young lady to see James.\nJAMES: What?\nSINNOT: Knew you were a dark horse.\nMESSENGER: Says she comes from Drogheda.\nJAMES: Show her in.\nACE: (breathless) You'll be James, yeah?\nJAMES: We haven't met. Please, you're drenched. Here - come and sit by the fire. Have a drink.\nACE: Oh. Oh, thanks. I'm Ace. I was with Kieran at the siege.\nJAMES: Oh.\nACE: He's... he's dead. Look, I'm sorry.\nJAMES: Ah. We'd already given up hope. You see, Colonel?\nSINNOT: It won't be the same here, it can't be. Did he really kill everyone, the women and children?\nACE: Mary's alive, James. I've got her with me.\nJAMES: You brought her all the way here? How is she?\nACE: She's outside the town. Please, you've got to come with me!\nJAMES: She shouldn't be out in this weather.\nSINNOT: Why should James believe you?\nACE: What's it to you?\nJAMES: Colonel Sinnot's in charge, Ace.\nACE: Oh. You can't surrender, Colonel. Whatever they promise you, they'll cut you down anyway.\nSINNOT: Cromwell's proven himself to be a man of honour. Ruthless, yes, and determined, but I can't believe he wants to slaughter us.\nSINNOT: What's that? A storm?\nACE: It's not thunder.\nHEX: Where is he? Where is he?!\nCROMWELL: Looking for me, lad? Fancy some breakfast?\nHEX: What are you playing at? You said you'd give 'em time.\nCROMWELL: And I did. We're not attacking them yet. This is all just to encourage them to get a move on.\nHEX: We said we'd wait to hear from them.\nCROMWELL: Yes, and we've been waiting all week. They're stalling us. Sinnot tells me he's waiting for proper authority. /'m the proper authority, damn him!\nHEX: But they won't surrender now.\nCROMWELL: They will if they know what's good for them. Now, come on, have some toast. The bacon's good too.\nHEX: Oh my God, you're impossible.\nCROMWELL: What did you say?\nHEX: Er... sometimes it's impossible to reason with ya. No offence, yeah?\nCROMWELL: Not that. What did you say?\nHEX: I don't know. Oh God, look.\nHEX: Ow! What's that about? Oh my God!\nCROMWELL: You dare? (shouting) You dare?\nHEX: What did I do?\nCROMWELL: I've had men hanged for less. You dare instruct me on siege warfare? And then you take the Lord's name in vain, right in front of me?\nHEX: I didn't mean it. Look, we can sort this out, yeah?\nCROMWELL: Oh, more sorting out. My men are dying in the mud while you and your Irish friends sort out just how you'll profit. I think you are a witch, boy. You've had me under some kind of spell for days. Roberts! Turner!\nROBERTS: + TURNER: Sir?\nCROMWELL: Time we showed the town who's in charge. And this blasohemer needs a lesson too.\nROBERTS: + TURNER: Sir!\nHEX: No. Wait. Look, I didn't mean it. Come on. Come on. Ah, get off.\nSINNOT: Ready the barricades. Someone, clear these bodies.\nACE: I promised the Doctor we'd get straight back to him.\nJAMES: I'm still not sure about this. Can't you see that I'm needed here?\nACE: Please, James. I saw what they did in Drogheda. They killed everyone.\nJAMES: Then we should all get out.\nSINNOT: I can't believe Cromwell would go back on his word. We've had days of very genial correspondence, and my messengers say how well-treated they've been.\nACE: I can only tell you what I saw.\nJAMES: Everyone all right? Ace?\nACE: Yeah. Yeah, fine. Oh, we've got to get a move on.\nSINNOT: They won't let you out.\nACE: What? Why?\nSINNOT: Look around you, ma'am. I think the negotiations are over. Step out the gates, and that army will cut you down.\nACE: You mean, we're trapped inside the town?\nCOOTE: We'll be going in as soon as there is a way in. As before, lads, you wait for my mark. Search the buildings as you come to them. We want to push them back to the water. Be careful with the women and children, when you can be.\nMARY: They have to come soon.\nDOCTOR: I'm sure they'll be fine. Ace knows what she's doing. They'll get out of there.\nMARY: I don't think we should be in the enemy camp.\nDOCTOR: Oh, it's safer being in their shadow. If we keep our distance from them, they might think we mean harm. Here, they won't even notice us.\nMARY: I think they might notice us, actually.\nDOCTOR: What? Mary, you're not, well...\nMARY: Sorry.\nDOCTOR: Come on, sit down. Too much excitement. Don't want the baby making an appearance here now, do we?\nMARY: I think it might be a bit late for that.\nDOCTOR: What?\nMARY: You're going to have to be a midwife after all, Doctor. My waters have gone.\nDOCTOR: What? You've got to be joking. You can't expect me to deliver a baby, not now!"

You'll have had his you can't change history speech?\nHEX: Ah, yeah.\nACE: But that's just clearly not true. Otherwise why would he bother?\nHEX: Perhaps he can only change some things. You know, nothing that matters, small stuff.\nACE: Oh no, I think it matters. Oh, I don't believe it.\nHEX: What?\nACE: We're only out of milk. Have to wait till the Doctor gets back.\nHEX: Or can have it with lemon.\nACE: Don't think we've got any of them either.\nHEX: Or just as it comes. Aren't there lemon trees in the library?\nACE: (laughs) It's the sort of place he'd put them. When did you see them there?\nHEX: Er, a while ago. Or I might have just dreamt them.\nACE: Come on, we'll go look. Got nothing better to do. We'll take the tea things with us. Bring a knife, yeah?\nHEX: Sure.\nACE: What is it? Still painful?\nHEX: Yeah, only when I move.\nACE: Oh, let me see.\nHEX: I'm okay, really.\nACE: Okay. But I'll carry this lot. What did they do to you, Hex?\nROBERTS: Oi. Not finished yet? (slapping) Wake up!\nHEX: Mmm...\nROBERTS: You there!\nTURNER: He's out of it.\nROBERTS: Leave off, then. Think we should let him be for a minute. Hey! Wriggling like a weasel.\nHEX: And as vicious. Get off me!\nJAMES: We have to get the women and children out.\nSINNOT: He said he'd wait. He said he'd wait!\nACE: Colonel, you have to get the people out of here. He's going to kill them all.\nSINNOT: Evacuate the town. Women and children to the harbour. Commandeer whatever boats you have to. Soldiers! To the, to the rear there.\nJAMES: You go too, Ace.\nACE: Not running away.\nSINNOT: Man the barricades!\nJAMES: You have to go back to Mary. Please.\nACE: Okay. But James, don't fight them. Don't even pick up a weapon.\nJAMES: What?\nACE: Really. If you don't resist them, they might not...\nJAMES: Don't worry about me, Ace. Go!\nHEX: Get off! I really will put a spell on you two.\nTURNER: What?\nHEX: You don't think a witch can defend himself? I'll turn you into... into a gerbil.\nTURNER: Dan, what's a gerbil?\nHEX: Er, a horrible foul-smelling hairy great thing.\nTURNER: Get away.\nHEX: Yeah, but I had you going.\nROBERTS: Go on then, do a spell.\nHEX: All right, er, how about...\nROBERTS: What the hell was that?\nDOCTOR: It's all right. We'll get through this.\nMARY: You've done this before, yeah?\nDOCTOR: Oh, all the time.\nTURNER: What are you up to in here, then?\nDOCTOR: Ah. Good man. Now, get down to the stables, find me the cleanest, driest straw you can lay your hands on.\nTURNER: Huh?\nDOCTOR: I gave you an order.\nTURNER: Sir!\nDOCTOR: Well, that got rid of him.\nTURNER: Keep the pace up, lads. Steady rhythm of firing, that's the way. And boom, two, three, four. Boom, two, three, four. That's it.\nROBERTS: No. No, wait, wait, wait, you'll hit our lot.\nTURNER: What are you on about, Roberts? No order's been given to attack.\nROBERTS: Listen, Turner. That witch boy's escaped, and we've got to get after him.\nHEX: It's just a bit further. Just a bit further. I could do with another magic trick, Hex. Yeah, that'll do.\nJAMES: Halt. Who's there?\nHEX: Please. You've got to let me in. There's soldiers right behind me.\nCROMWELL: Shouldn't be long now, Goddard.\nGODDARD: They've still not given in?\nCROMWELL: No, not just yet. Give them a chance to get over here.\nGODDARD: At least it's something for the men to do.\nCROMWELL: Well, we can't have them laying about idle. Isn't that right, Jenkins?\nJENKINS: Yes, sir.\nGODDARD: He'll be dead by nighifall, sir. Your raiding party needs to get a move on.\nCROMWELL: My what?\nGODDARD: I'm not arguing. No, it's not exactly by the rules, but it's, it's the right thing to do. Time to end this.\nCROMWELL: Really? Many of them in this raiding party?\nGODDARD: A dozen maybe, to begin with.\nCROMWELL: What on Earth's that?\nJENKINS: Devil's come to get us.\nGODDARD: Hardly, Jenkins. A woman, I think, sir.\nCROMWELL: I thought for a minute...\nGODDARD: Sir?\nCROMWELL: No, no, it's nothing. Native superstitions must be getting to me. She's in pain, by the sound of it. Though of course you're the expert.\nGODDARD: I'd better see what's happening.\nCROMWELL: Yes, you'd better. And I'll find out what this raiding party's about. We'll keep our decorum and discipline yet.\nCROMWELL: Yes, thank you for that, Jenkins.\nACE: No! You're not listening! I'm not getting on your boat!\nSINNOT: But you'll run back into Cromwell's cut-throats.\nACE: That's the idea.\nGODDARD: Out of the way there. What's going on here?\nCOOTE: It's a lady, sir. I think she's having a baby.\nGODDARD: Impossible.\nDOCTOR: Do you mind not getting in my light?\nGODDARD: Who are you?\nDOCTOR: The Doctor. I mean, what does it look like?\nGODDARD: I'm the doctor here.\nDOCTOR: Good. Come and give me a hand.\nGODDARD: You're joking. Who is this girl?\nDOCTOR: Doctor, do you abide by the Hippocratic Oath?\nGODDARD: Of course I do.\nDOCTOR: Then help me. Come on, she won't bite.\nHEX: I owe you one. They were going to kill me.\nSINNOT: Any enemy of theirs, lad. What's your name?\nJAMES: Hex. You look terrible. Been in the wars, huh?\nHEX: Me and Cromwell had a falling-out.\nSINNOT: Doesn't everyone? James says you're trustworthy. How would you play this?\nHEX: You've got to surrender. He'll kill every last one of you if you don''t, on principle.\nSINNOT: Oh yes, the great man of conscience. We heard what happened at Drogheda.\nHEX: I was there. It doesn't matter what you think, he reckons he's got Divine Right on his side. Nothing's going to stop him.\nJAMES: Please, sir.\nSINNOT: Very well. Gather the field offic...\nSINNOT: What was that?\nGODDARD: They've started on the town again.\nDOCTOR: Really, Goddard, you think so?\nMARY: He's going to slaughter them.\nDOCTOR: Now, you keep your mind on what you're doing.\nGODDARD: She's right, though. I saw men attacking the town.\nDOCTOR: Can one of you fine soldiers go and find me a towel?\nMARY: Stop gawping and as what he says.\nGODDARD: We should keep her covered for decency's sake.\nDOCTOR: Do you know how many mothers die because they're swaddled in blankets for decency's sake?\nGODDARD: No, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Well, that's something you could look into one day, isn't it?\nGODDARD: Cromwell's been on at me about what we can do better. He's not a man of learning but he's got a great respect for science.\nMARY: He is a monster. Cromwell killed the King.\nDOCTOR: Calm down now, Mary. Calm down. Here we go. Oh, ignore her calling down the Heavens, gentlemen. It's quite usual in cases of extreme pain like this. Isn't that right, Goddard?\nGODDARD: Oh, yes, Doctor. It's cathartic.\nTURNER: Oi. You there.\nACE: Me? I'm not doing anything.\nTURNER: Escaped from the town, have we, girl?\nACE: Please, I'm on your side. Just heading back to camp.\nTURNER: I've never seen you. What's your name?\nACE: Ace.\nTURNER: What's that, then? Irish?\nACE: Er, it's, er, short for Elizabeth. Good English name, Elizabeth, isn't it?\nTURNER: I suppose.\nACE: What are you worried about? I'm just a girl.\nTURNER: Oh yeah, you're not dangerous. Go on, then.\nACE: (sotto) Hooray for sexism.\nHEX: Didn't think of you as a feminist, Ace.\nACE: Neither did I, really.\nACE: Ah, here we are.\nACE: Big, isn't it? Doctor says he's read everything, of course. Have to watch people who read a lot. They go all peculiar. I went out with a reader once.\nHEX: Look, I'm not sure I really saw lemon trees in here.\nACE: Mmm, guess it'd be too obvious to hope they're under Horticulture. Right, scientific approach. You take that aisle.\nHEX: Ace?\nACE: Come on, or the tea'll be cold.\nHEX: Ace? They're over here. As part of this orchard, where he's got all of his Ladybird books. There's something really wrong with the Doctor.\nACE: Like I said. A reader.\nCROMWELL: And they've not sent anyone out to us yet? The resolutions are all ready to sign.\nROBERTS: No, sir. At least none what have got through.\nCROMWELL: What's in their way, man?! Oh. Sorry, Roberts. Ought to hold firm with the end just in sight. You were saying?\nROBERTS: Well sir, there was some men attacked the town, you see.\nCROMWELL: They were chasing Hex. He's fled to the enemy.\nROBERTS: Yes, sir. But some of the other men, they got the wrong idea.\nCROMWELL: But there's been no order to attack the town.\nROBERTS: I think it might be a bit late for that now, sir. Half the men have already gone.\nCROMWELL: What!\nSINNOT: The English are here. The English are here. Everyone onto the ships.\nHEX: There's too many people. They're never gonna float.\nSINNOT: We can't leave anyone. Where's James?\nHEX: I'll find him.\nACE: Excuse me, gents. Doctor? You in here?\nDOCTOR: Ace? You found James?\nACE: Sorry, Doctor. We'd never have got him back here. Things had kind of started too quickly.\nDOCTOR: Tell me about it.\nACE: I told him not to fight them.\nDOCTOR: Good. Now, if you don't mind not hogging my light.\nACE: Sorry. You look like you know what you're doing.\nGODDARD: Everything's being done, Miss. Your friend will be fine.\nACE: Cheers. Who are you?\nDOCTOR: That's Jonathan Goddard. Ace, we're going to need a pair of obstetric forceps.\nACE: Of course we are. And they are...?\nDOCTOR: Forceps, Ace. What do they sound like?\nACE: Right.\nDOCTOR: Tardis infirmary. First cupboard along. They'll be wrapped in plastic and the tag says Chamberlain.\nACE: But the Tardis is miles away.\nDOCTOR: Then you'll have to run, won't you?\nACE: Oh.\nDOCTOR: Just do as I tell you.\nACE: All right.\nTURNER: You there.\nJAMES: I'm not armed.\nTURNER: You live here, yes?\nJAMES: I won't fight you.\nTURNER: Suits me. Easier to kill you.\nHEX: Not so fast, mate. He's with me.\nJAMES: Hex! You said not to fight.\nHEX: Yeah, well.\nDOCTOR: And she couldn't have been too unhappy though. I mean, she married Alaric's brother.\nGODDARD: But he had kidnapped her.\nDOCTOR: Yes, but he could be quite charming too. Anyway, the marriage didn't last long, and he was killed, and Galla Placidia went back to Rome. Another push, Mary.\nGODDARD: And lived happily ever after?\nDOCTOR: No, not quite, no. There were battles and things, but she married again and her son became one of the Emperors.\nGODDARD: You're making this up.\nMARY: Oh! Don't make me laugh, please.\nDOCTOR: And push again. Good. Ace will be here soon.\nMARY: I can't really wait for her.\nDOCTOR: You know, Galla's daughter was just like her Mum.\nGODDARD: This sounds like another story.\nDOCTOR: It's a good one. You see, Attila the Hun was sitting around with his friends one day, and someone brings him a letter. And with the letter there was an engagement ring, and...\nACE: Come on, come on! Come on, come on, something with a tag. Oh, what's this? Doctor, here's the framework, you know the rest. Love, Chamberlain. Oh, right.\nHEX: We need to be on higher ground.\nJAMES: The harbour's the only way out, Hex.\nHEX: But there's no way out. We should head for the castle.\nJAMES: The castle's already surrendered.\nHEX: What?\nJAMES: It's over.\nHEX: Does it look like it's over? James, I know what's going to happen. Got it drummed in as a kid. It's gonna be worse here than Drogheda.\nHEX: Could things have been different, Ace? I can't see what other choice there was. We had to fight.\nACE: Here's your tea. Hope it's not too stewed.\nHEX: Cheers. Well?\nACE: (sigh) Yeah, things could have been different. If I'd got to you earlier, or we landed nearer, or if I'd runa bit faster. Huh! Spent most of the night running.\nHEX: But what could / have done differently?\nACE: I think Cromwell felt the same.\nHEX: You what?\nACE: Doctor? Doctor, I got it.\nDOCTOR: I knew I could count on you.\nACE: Don't mention it.\nGODDARD: What in God's name is that?\nDOCTOR: Forceps. For extracting the baby, in case of complication.\nMARY: Don't even think about it!\nGODDARD: Oh no, it's going to be fine. Doctor, that's brilliant.\nDOCTOR: Oh, Chamberlain was a clever one, though he didn't like the noise.\nGODDARD: The effect this would have on mortality rates.\nDOCTOR: Quite so. Though he still delivered babies under the bed sheets, and dressed these things in leather, so they didn't make a sound.\nACE: Urgh, that's not very hygienic.\nDOCTOR: If you want to be useful, Ace, go and find Hex.\nACE: What?\nGODDARD: He'll probably be in the Lord General's tent.\nDOCTOR: Yes, go on. You're no use to me here.\nACE: Fine. Thanks.\nSINNOT: Keep still. Stop fighting. You'll capsize us.\nSINNOT: We can still get across the river. We can...\nCROMWELL: And find Goddard. Get him back for the injured.\nACE: Ahem. Er, excuse me?\nCROMWELL: A woman? Er, men, you can leave us.\nACE: I'm looking for Hex? Thomas Schofield.\nCROMWELL: Ah. Yes, you must be his friend from Drogheda. He said you'd come looking for him, if you could. (sigh) Well, come in, have a drink. You look exhausted. And you've been out in the rain. Mmm. Er, long journey, was it? Sorry, you're from Drogheda. Of course it was. Now, I'm sorry, I've forgotten your name.\nACE: Ace. Er, oh. It's short for Elizabeth.\nCROMWELL: Is it now? Well, that must be a sign we're going to get on, you and I.\nACE: We are?\nCROMWELL: Well, Elizabeth, you've really picked your moment. The commander up in Wexford Castle has surrendered. The place is ours.\nACE: So you can stop the fighting?\nCROMWELL: Already given the order. It's been a long time coming, but we've been spared a whole effusion of blood.\nACE: I was at Drogheda.\nCROMWELL: Yes. Yes, you were. But what we did there has been justified.\nACE: You think so?\nCROMWELL: Once word got round about that, no other town would hold out to us. It saved thousands of lives on both sides. It was worth it.\nACE: Really, it wasn't.\nCROMWELL: It had to be done. We were being tested. Oh God, we were tested. God. (cries.)\nACE: Hey. Er. Hey, it's all right. It's all over now.\nACE: I'm not forgiving him anything, but ... but he was weeping. Really weeping.\nHEX: And what did you do?\nACE: What could I do? You couldn’t help but feel some kind of sympathy. This great terrible man buckling under the strain.\nHEX: Yeah. You never knew what he'd be like. He'd turn on a knife edge.\nACE: No, he was... surprising.\nHEX: There was nothing surprising about him. We knew what he was going to do with Wexford, and he did it.\nROBERTS: By command of the Lord General, the siege is over.\nHEX: Don't believe him. They're going to massacre the town.\nJAMES: Hex is right. They're going to kill all of us. But let's die like men. Agreed?\nHEX: Come on, then. Charge!\nDOCTOR: And again, Mary. You're so nearly there.\nMARY: I can't!\nGODDARD: Yes you can.\nDOCTOR: It's a boy.\nDOCTOR: It's a beautifully healthy boy.\nGODDARD: Well done, Mary.\nDOCTOR: Where's that straw? Ah, this'll keep you warm, wee babby. There you go.\nCROMWELL: [OC]: All right, men.\nGODDARD: Show's over, you think?\nDOCTOR: They'll be wanted for the siege. You'll probably be needed, Goddard. But thank you.\nGODDARD: My pleasure.\nMARY: They're going to kill them all.\nDOCTOR: Hush now. There's nothing we can do. I'm just glad my friends are safely outside the town.\nHEX: They're not going to take the town! They're not going to take the town!\nHEX: They were always going to take the town.\nACE: Here, drink this. It was a good cause, Hex. Worth fighting for.\nHEX: And dying for?\nACE: You didn't die though, did you?\nHEX: Enough people did, and I thought I was a gonner. Thought you and the Doctor were dead. What else was there?\nACE: It's nothing to be ashamed of. It's even noble. Oh Hex, you were a hero, a leader.\nHEX: You don't believe that.\nACE: I do. I'm... well, I suppose I'm proud of you.\nHEX: Ace, you know as well as I do, what they did to Wexford was a direct result of me fighting.\nCROMWELL: Other than that, I've tried to let my conscience lead me, but we've done terrible, terrible things.\nACE: It's okay, Oliver.\nCOOTE: Sir, they're fighting again.\nCROMWELL: What? No, that's impossible.\nCOOTE: They're attacking us, sir, and Hex is leading 'em.\nCROMWELL: The treasonous wretch!\nACE: You must have got it wrong.\nCROMWELL: I've had it wrong for weeks. That boy has drawn this all out too long and I've been an idiot to listen to him!\nACE: But wait. Listen!\nCROMWELL: Chidley Coote?\nCOOTE: Yes, sir.\nCROMWELL: A new order for the men. Kill them. Kill them alll!\nROBERTS: A new order for the men. Kill them. Kill them all. No mercy, by order of the Lord General."

If you think you can manage it.\nHEX: I'm fine, thanks.\nACE: You are looking better.\nHEX: It's... this place affects you, don't it?\nACE: Maybe it's all the books.\nHEX: No. I mean the Tardis. It's just so peaceful. If I was the Doctor, I mean, well, you'd never want to leave, would ya?\nACE: He couldn't do that. Being in here, well, it'd just be like staying at home watching the world on TV. Why bother going anywhere when you can just stay in where it's cosy?\nHEX: That's a good point. Ace? Supposing I struck out on my own?\nACE: You don't have to leave. You said you were feeling better.\nHEX: No, just supposing I did, you Know, left the Tardis, the Doctor.\nACE: Well?\nHEX: Would you come with me?\nJAMES: Watch your left!\nHEX: Oh, cheers.\nJAMES: Hope you're not flagging, Hex.\nHEX: I could do this all day, now I know how it's done. Argh!\nJAMES: Hex!\nCROMWELL: They’ve brought this on themselves, Elizabeth. We can't show weakness. People have to remember this.\nACE: Oh, they will. They'll remember.\nCROMWELL: Good.\nACE: For all the wrong reasons. Do you know what I knew about Oliver Cromwell? Your warts. That you banned Christmas. That you were dug up and hanged again when they brought back the King.\nCROMWELL: Hex said something about my reputation centuries from now.\nACE: Yeah, you should have listened to him.\nCROMWELL: I did. He betrayed me. My men even think he's a witch.\nACE: Not the brightest bunch, squaddies.\nCROMWELL: You're the ones with visions of the future.\nACE: You just don't want to hear this. I'm not a witch.\nCROMWELL: You know what my men would say?\nACE: There's no such thing as witches.\nCROMWELL: Of course not. I'm a rational man, Elizabeth, which is just as well for you.\nACE: How's that?\nCROMWELL: Witchcraft's illegal. If I did believe you, I'd have to have you executed.\nDOCTOR: Ah, it'll be a little basic, but this should work as a crib.\nMARY: It's fine, Doctor. Thank you. Ow!\nDOCTOR: Hungry, is he?\nMARY: Greedy. Fitzgerald appetite, just like his dad had.\nDOCTOR: After this is over, I'll take you, James and the little babby somewhere else. Somewhere better.\nMARY: You know James won't be coming with us.\nDOCTOR: I'm sure he'd be different now, Mary. We'll win him over.\nMARY: No, Doctor. James is in the town.\nDOCTOR: Ace told him not to fight. He'll be fine.\nMARY: Ha! You believe that?\nDOCTOR: We have to.\nJAMES: Hex? Hex!\nHEX: Don't worry about me. Flesh wound.\nROBERTS: Cromwell wants the witch-boy alive.\nJAMES: Hah. You're not having him. Argh!\nHEX: James. James!\nROBERTS: You're coming with us, then.\nHEX: Get off me! Get off me!\nROBERTS: Stop that, yeah? I'm not really in the mood.\nCROMWELL: Out of the way, then. Out of the way. Ah, you must be the Doctor. I assume you know who I am?\nACE: Doctor, this is...\nMARY: Keep him away. Keep him away from my baby.\nDOCTOR: You have to stay still, Mary. I won't let him hurt you. Ace, you found Hex?\nACE: Doctor, he's in the town.\nDOCTOR: What's he doing there?\nCROMWELL: Look, enough about him, Doctor. I heard you administer to women. What are you like on wounded soldiers?\nDOCTOR: Prevention's always the best remedy.\nCROMWELL: What?\nDOCTOR: Wounds are better avoided than cured.\nACE: Doctor, Hex is in...\nDOCTOR: I heard you the first time, Ace.\nCROMWELL: Doctor, my men need your help.\nDOCTOR: And if I help them, they'll kill more people. Ace, stay with Mary. She can't move about.\nACE: Right.\nDOCTOR: Excuse me, please.\nCROMWELL: Don't walk away from me, man! Where are you going?\nDOCTOR: To help. What else can I do?\nGODDARD: Hold his shoulders. Hold his shoulders! Oh, thank heavens.\nDOCTOR: Where do you want me?\nGODDARD: Oh, anywhere, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: What are your plans for that leg?\nGODDARD: Amputation. Sorry. Bullet's got lodged in the bone.\nDOCTOR: Mind if I look?\nGODDARD: Be my guest, but you'd need a miracle. In a minute, Jenkins!\nDOCTOR: Yes, it is quite stuck in there, isn't it?\nGODDARD: What's that you're doing?\nDOCTOR: Your miracle. All done with sound. Now, let me focus, one more, right where it's needed. Good. Now, you'll need to cauterise this. Sorry, it'll hurt.\nGODDARD: All done. Next, please?\nCROMWELL: Who does he think he is? Nobody speaks to me like that!\nACE: He's just trying to help people.\nCROMWELL: And what do you think I'm doing?\nMARY: You are the Devil Incarnate.\nCROMWELL: What?\nACE: Shh, Mary. Don't provoke him. And you - oh, you should just go.\nMARY: He killed Kieran. He killed them all.\nCROMWELL: She's distraught, of course, but I still deserve some...\nACE: Just back off!\nCOOTE: Lord General, Lord General.\nCROMWELL: What is it, Chidley Coote?\nCOOTE: Sir, they've got him.\nGODDARD: Did you study embroidery, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: The stitches should pull against each other. Means less scarring.\nGODDARD: Good. Next?\nACE: [OC]: Doctor? Doctor!\nGODDARD: Now then, soldier, bullet wound, is it? Well, there's a lot of that about just now.\nDOCTOR: Okay, I'm done. Next? Oh dear. Been in the wars, have we?\nACE: Doctor, you've got to come quickly.\nDOCTOR: I said stay with Mary.\nACE: You've got to stop him!\nGODDARD: You can see for yourself, I need the Doctor here.\nDOCTOR: We're busy, Ace.\nACE: But Cromwell's going to execute Hex!\nHEX: And I'd do it again in an instant. Don't you get it? Because of us, the women and children got away from ya.\nROBERTS: Remember who you're talking to, boy.\nCROMWELL: You're wrong, Hex. The women and children crowded onto boats, and the boats just sank under the weight.\nHEX: What?\nCROMWELL: That's what I'm told. Hundreds drowned. What do we conclude from that?\nHEX: This isn't a history lesson.\nCROMWELL: None of this has been my fault. You brought this on yourselves.\nHEX: You don't really believe that?\nCROMWELL: It's a fact. All this plotting and ploying and begging more time. If they just submitted to the authority of Parliament...\nHEX: You're not here for Parliament, Oliver. They sent you away to get rid of ya.\nROBERTS: Watch that mouth.\nCROMWELL: There's no need for that, Roberts.\nHEX: You're a tyrant, plain and simple. Someone disagrees with ya, and you butcher them.\nCROMWELL: That's very unfair. I enjoyed our discussions, Hex. I encouraged you to be frank with me. You betrayed that trust.\nHEX: You were the one who turned on me. You don't really see it, do ya?\nCROMWELL: I thought you were a man of conscience. I was wrong.\nROBERTS: He's a traitor, sir.\nHEX: Never mattered what I said.\nCROMWELL: And now yout life is forfeit. Set it up, Roberts.\nROBERTS: Sir.\nHEX: Hey, don't.\nHEX: Ace? Ace? Look, what have I gone and done now? Don't be like this.\nACE: I'm not being like anything. There's a jar of ointment in the console room.\nHEX: What are you talking about?\nACE: Hex, you're covered in bruises. We were meant to be patching you up.\nHEX: Look, I was only asking, that's all. I'm not going anywhere, honest.\nACE: No. Just working it all out in your head.\nHEX: Yeah.\nACE: So you'll be ready to go. Soon as we're somewhere you'll dare to explore. Soon as we get you home.\nHEX: Hey, that's not fair. Listen to what I'm telling ya.\nDOCTOR: How come you never do as you're told?\nACE: Please, Doctor. We have to hurry.\nDOCTOR: Mary needs looking after.\nACE: She's just had a baby, she's not going anywhere.\nDOCTOR: Cromwell? Cromwell!\nCROMWELL: Finished already, Doctor? You must be a good surgeon.\nACE: They're going to hang him!\nCROMWELL: What did you expect? We're not barbarians.\nDOCTOR: Give him to me, Cromwell. He's mine.\nCROMWELL: Hanging is very humane.\nACE: You can't do this! Doctor, tell him! Hex!\nACE: [OC]: Hex!\nHEX: Ace? It's Ace and the Doctor!\nROBERTS: Friends of yours?\nHEX: I didn't think they'd made it.\nROBERTS: Get all sorts turning out to see a thing like this.\nHEX: No, I mean, I thought they were dead.\nROBERTS: Yeah. It's ironic. Right. Lift your arms up.\nHEX: They're alive. Oh my God. They're alive.\nACE: You have to stop this, Cromwell.\nCROMWELL: You'd better keep back, Elizabeth. I'll shoot you myself if I have to. I'd not enjoy that.\nDOCTOR: Whatever he's done, he'll be punished, but this is not the way.\nCROMWELL: I know all the arguments, Doctor. I thought Hex was special, above all this petty violence. But we are judged by our actions, and he turned on me.\nMARY: [OC]: Monster.\nDOCTOR: Mary. You shouldn't be on your feet.\nMARY: He wants to kill everyone.\nCROMWELL: Don't be ridiculous, woman. Now get away from me.\nGODDARD: Doctor, please.\nMARY: Devil! You're the Devil!\nACE: Let me take the baby.\nGODDARD: Doctor, you have to come to help me. I can't manage on my own.\nDOCTOR: Mary, please, he's serious.\nDOCTOR: Mary.\nCROMWELL: She gave me no choice.\nDOCTOR: I spent the best part of today keeping her alive!\nCROMWELL: Goddard, can you help her?\nGODDARD: Hardly, sir. At that range and given the condition she's in.\nACE: Doctor, there's Hex.\nDOCTOR: Are you going to help here, Goddard?\nGODDARD: What, me?\nDOCTOR: You're a doctor, aren't you?\nGODDARD: Yes.\nDOCTOR: Then get over here!\nHEX: What are they playing at now?\nROBERTS: I wouldn't worry about it.\nHEX: No. It's always a mess with him.\nROBERTS: You're following in the wake of a great man. Stands to reason.\nHEX: I guess so.\nROBERTS: You know where you are with him, though. Cromwell's got his heart in the right place.\nHEX: Yeah. Can't say the same for the Doctor.\nROBERTS: Right. This needs to go over your head.\nHEX: Doesn't everything.\nROBERTS: Very good. Genuine gallows humour.\nDOCTOR: Staunch the bleeding, man.\nGODDARD: It's not going to work.\nDOCTOR: Have some faith.\nACE: Cromwell, you've got to stop this. Listen to me.\nCROMWELL: They brought this on themselves.\nACE: Yeah, and you can stop them. That's what all this is meant to be about, isn't it? Stopping the fighting, not starting it.\nCROMWELL: We came to heal and settle the nation.\nACE: The woman you shot, she spent all day in agony just to get this baby out.\nCROMWELL: I know.\nACE: You couldn't do that. The Doctor, he's doing everything to save her. You couldn't do that either, could you?\nCROMWELL: I'm a soldier. A very good soldier. I have to make the most of my gift.\nGODDARD: It's gone through her lung, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I can see that.\nGODDARD: Got to admire her though, haven't you?\nDOCTOR: She shouldn't have been on her feet.\nGODDARD: Well, some things are worth fighting for.\nDOCTOR: Lives, for example.\nGODDARD: He killed her husband, didn't he?\nDOCTOR: Goddard, have you ever seen a sunflower?\nGODDARD: No. Pictures in a book once.\nDOCTOR: I love sunflowers. And cream poured on ice cream so that it dries hard. I even love walking in the rain.\nGODDARD: You must love Ireland, then.\nDOCTOR: I suppose I do. Have you ever been in love?\nGODDARD: Once or twice.\nDOCTOR: And would you kill for love, Goddard.\nGODDARD: (sighs) Yes.\nDOCTOR: Then it wasn't love. I need you to hold her still.\nROBERTS: Right, there's another step coming up. Okay? And then we're on the platform.\nHEX: Thanks.\nROBERTS: Right. Rope going round your head. Oh, sorry. That your ears?\nHEX: Look, you don't have to be so nice about this.\nROBERTS: Sorry, mate. Born that way. Hold on a sec, see that?\nHEX: I've got this bag over me head.\nROBERTS: You should be honoured, lad. Cromwell's watching. And that girlfriend of yours.\nHEX: She's not my girlfriend.\nROBERTS: Well, not now she won't be.(laughs) Sorry, no offence.\nHEX: Doesn't matter.\nROBERTS: Pretty girl.\nHEX: You marry her, then.\nROBERTS: Yeah, I've already got one, thanks.\nHEX: Ah well. But, yeah, she is.\nACE: Right, take your shirt off.\nHEX: What?\nACE: Don't get all coy. This stuff's really good on bumps and bruises.\nHEX: Okay.\nACE: Oh God, Hex!\nHEX: Yeah, I know. It's quite a mess.\nACE: You should work out or something.\nHEX: Funny. Give it here, then. Ah!\nACE: That means it's working. Come on, let me help. Better?\nHEX: Yeah. This stuff really works. Feelng like... What? What?\nACE: You know what you were saying earlier?\nHEX: Was I? What about?\nACE: Mmm, about never knowing where we're going. About- striking out on our own.\nHEX: Oh yeah? That.\nACE: I've got an idea what we could do about it.\nHEX: Think I've got an idea too.\nACE: Get some readouts on the console. Large letters so we can't miss them. Where we are, and when. South Croydon, Human Era, AD 1990.\nHEX: Oh. Right. Yeah, er, that's what I was thinking too.\nCROMWELL: He's taking it so calmly.\nACE: You've got to let him go.\nCROMWELL: Have I? Give me a reason.\nACE: You've got a chance to save him. You can actually stop someone dying. Look at Mary. Look at the Doctor. Look at them. Oliver, please. Stop the killing.\nCROMWELL: It's out of my hands.\nACE: Please.\nCROMWELL: It's stopped raining.\nGODDARD: It's not possible.\nCROMWELL: What is it, Goddard?\nGODDARD: See for yourself, sir.\nDOCTOR: Don't crowd her. Let her sit up. Welcome back, Mary.\nMARY: Doctor? What happened to me?\nGODDARD: But at that range, and her condition, it just isn't possible.\nCROMWELL: Praise God. Cut the lad down! He's free!\nHEX: By rights, you know I should have died.\nACE: Don't talk like that. And hurry up. If the Doctor comes back and finds you with your shirt off...\nHEX: He'll think we've found a very human way of dealing with what we've both been through. He'd understand.\nACE: Hex, you're like my little brother.\nHEX: Yeah, I know. But that's what the Doctor'd think. And it's not so unlikely, is it?\nACE: You were telling me how you ought to be dead?\nHEX: Well, I didn't listen to the Doctor.\nACE: So the punishment is death?\nHEX: Well, I fought. I led the town and I got them all killed. By rights, I should have died with them. It would have been... well, right.\nACE: There but for the grace of...\nHEX: Yeah. Well, Cromwell believes - really believes - there's someone in charge of everything, directing, making it turn out like it should.\nACE: He's a monster. Slaughtered thousands. Here. You've missed the cuts on your face.\nHEX: Thanks. Thanks for everything.\nACE: You're welcome, kid brother.\nHEX: Ha ha. I guess he could use what he believed to justify anything, though. As if there was something or someone looking after it all, like believing in Father Christmas.\nCROMWELL: You were at Drogheda, and then you were here. You should have been long gone from Wexford before I arrived.\nDOCTOR: Our transport was delayed. A lucky accident.\nCROMWELL: There's no such thing. He guides all of us.\nDOCTOR: I won't condone what you've done here, Oliver. I can't give you peace.\nCROMWELL: They're saying we killed women and children too, that we levelled the towns. It's a story.\nDOCTOR: Is it?\nCROMWELL: Others will surrender to us now without any more bloodshed. Doesn't that make it right?\nDOCTOR: No.\nCROMWELL: But I've saved thousands of lives.\nDOCTOR: Look at the heaps of dead on both sides. Tell me you can be proud of this.\nCROMWELL: No, no, not proud.\nDOCTOR: A bit of humility is good for us all.\nCROMWELL: I should submit to Parliament myself?\nDOCTOR: Won't be easy.\nCROMWELL: No. But that's how I know that it's right. Thank you, Doctor. We'll talk on this more.\nGODDARD: Answering the Lord General's questions?\nDOCTOR: Getting him to ask the right questions.\nGODDARD: You're not going to explain how you saved Mary either.\nDOCTOR: You have to work it out for yourself, Goddard. It's better for you that way.\nGODDARD: Oh, I'm gratified by your concern for my well-being, but... Go on, at least give me a clue.\nDOCTOR: You'll find there are like-minded people, people who'll ask the right questions. You could start a club.\nGODDARD: Be an odd sort of club.\nDOCTOR: (laughs) You don't know the half of it. Now, we'll just check on Mary.\nACE: Almost done. Hmm. I think it looks worse than it is. You're going to be fine.\nHEX: You think?\nACE: Yeah. Look, sometimes it's tough what we do, but we made a difference.\nHEX: Did we?\nACE: Course we did. We saved Mary and the baby.\nHEX: Big deal. Do you see how many died? My gran used to go on about Ireland. I thought it was propaganda, you know, part of the course.\nACE: It's what happens with history. There was this time in Tasmania when...\nHEX: But I saw it, Ace. I was part of it. I killed people.\nACE: You can't blame yourself for what happened, Hex. We do what we can and move on.\nHEX: But it's not what I am. You make out like it's so easy, like everything works out better once the Doctor turns up. It's not better.\nHEX: You're looking pleased with yourself.\nDOCTOR: Mary is going to be fine. Her son already has a long queue of godfathers. Goddard is off to start the Royal Society, and Cromwell? Well, he's going to try to be a better man.\nACE: And you believe him?\nDOCTOR: Well, he's been surrounded by people far less tolerant of others than he is, far less willing to think about what they're up to.\nHEX: Being the best of a bad bunch doesn't justify it.\nDOCTOR: No. How are you feeling, Hex? You still want to carry on with us?\nACE: Course he does. Don't you?\nHEX: I guess. Not sure I'm good at it, though.\nDOCTOR: Take your time. Think about it.\nHEX: I'm done with thinking about everything. Sorry. It's just Cromwell wanted me to debate just about everything. God, truth, women.\nDOCTOR: I'm sure it was illuminating.\nACE: No. He was quite charismatic, actually.\nDOCTOR: Ace! And he's a married man.\nHEX: I thought you were dead. I thought I owed ya.. I thought I could make a difference how things turned out.\nACE: And we did, Hex. We did pretty good.\nDOCTOR: You got him to hold off with Wexford, didn't you? You should be proud of that.\nHEX: It's all right, Doctor. I've learned my lesson.\nDOCTOR: And what's that?\nHEX: Isn't it obvious?\nDOCTOR: No.\nACE: From now on, Doctor, we do exactly what you tell us.\nDOCTOR: Do you know, I almost believe you."
