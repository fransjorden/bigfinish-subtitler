There is to be a —\nDOCTOR: Aha!\nTEGAN: You’ve done it?\nDOCTOR: Yes — looped the TARDIS through a parallel dimension where time runs in the opposite direction. They’1l never trace us now.\nTEGAN: Hey, she’s gone.\nDOCTOR: So she has. I so rarely get to see old friends.\nTEGAN: Have we landed?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Let’s grab Turlough and get out of here.\nDOCTOR: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 7\nDOCTOR: SCENE 3. CAPITOL LANDING BAY [CONTINUOUS]\nTEGAN: Doctor? Are you sure this is —\nARCANTIS: (D) Welcome back to the Lord President-elect of Gallifrey — the Doctor!\nASSEMBLED: TIME LORDS\nDOCTOR: Oh.\nTEGAN: (LOW) ‘They’1ll never trace us now’.\nDOCTOR: (LOW) Maybe I went via the wrong parallel dimension.\nTEGAN: (LOW) What do we do now?\nDOCTOR: (LOW) Smile and wave.\nLOWRI: Lord President, it is an honour and a privilege and (BEAT) an honour to welcome you back to your homeworld of Gallifrey as its rightful leader.\nDOCTOR: And you are...?\nLOWRI: Castellan Lowri, your excellency.\nDOCTOR: Excellent. I just need to pop into my TARDIS and grab a few things and I’1l be right with you. Tegan?\nTEGAN: Righto.\nTEGAN: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 8\nLOWRI: It might interest you to know that this landing bay has a dampening field that makes it impossible for any TARDIS to take off.\nDOCTOR: Oh.\nLOWRI: If you’d like to walk with me?\nDOCTOR: Come on, Tegan.\nLOWRI: Not her.\nTEGAN: What?\nLOWRI: There are a few formalities to be completed — the Chancellery Guard will escort you.\nTEGAN: (OFF) Hey! She said ‘escort’, not drag me off by the shoulders!\nDOCTOR: (TO LOWRI) Is this necessary?\nLOWRI: It’s just procedure.\nDOCTOR: (CALLS) Don’t worry, Tegan!\nTEGAN: (OFF) I’m not worried, I’m angry!\nDOCTOR: (CALLS) Good.\nLOWRI: Can we speak in the council chambers, your excellency?\nDOCTOR: All right.\nDOCTOR: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 9\nARCANTIS: (D) The dignity and poise — such a natural Presidential air. The Doctor, everyone.\nDOCTOR: Did you have to invite all these people?\nLOWRI: It wasn’t my idea.\nLOWRI: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 10\nLOWRI: SCENE 4. INT. CAPITOL CORRIDOR [CONTINUOUS]\nDOCTOR: You wanted to make it more difficult for me to duck out, didn’t you? In front of a great big crowd like that.\nLOWRI: I told you, it wasn’t my idea.\nDOCTOR: That sort of sleight-of-hand is worthy of your late predecessor, Castellan — um — You know, I don’t think I ever caught his name.\nLOWRI: The official story is that you were unavoidably detained tying up other business before you could take up the Presidency.\nVORENA: Welcome back, your excellency.\nDOCTOR: Thank you...\nVORENA: Chancellor Vorena. I’m a great admirer of yours.\nDOCTOR: (PLEASED) Oh.\nVORENA: I thought you might like some help with your inaugural address?\nLOWRI: I don’t think that will be necessary — excuse us.\nDOCTOR: This is all moving rather fast, isn’t it?\nLOWRI: It needs to.\nLOWRI: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 11\nLOWRI: SCENE 5. INT. COUNCIL CHAMBERS [CONTINUOUS]\nLOWRI: So, we think you should present yourself as —\nDOCTOR: Lowri, I like to think I’m an amenable sort of chap, especially compared with some of my recent incarnations, but even so I have no interest in being told what to do by the High Council.\nLOWRI: Right.\nDOCTOR: I don’t want to be President, and frankly I’m rather good at escaping from things.\nLOWRI: I see.\nDOCTOR: And furthermore, my appointment by so-called “emergency powers” was unconstitutional. No successor was named, hence an election should have been held, which I do not intend to contest.\nLOWRI: (SIGHS) They told me you’d be like this.\nDOCTOR: Who’s ‘they’?\nLOWRI: I don’t have a list to hand, but there were quite a few of them. Chancellor Flavia told the public you were indeed named by Borusa as his successor, so you [are —]\nDOCTOR: Where is Flavia? Let me talk to her.\nLOWRI: She retired.\nDOCTOR: Why?\nLOWRI: Because people blamed her for bungling the succession.\nDOCTOR: Well, they’re not far wrong. The idea I’m the rightful President is a complete fiction! No. I won’t do it.\nDOCTOR: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 12\nLOWRI: We’ve announced it all now — you have [to —]\nLOWRI: Hello?\nVORENA: (D) When are you going to be done, Lowri?\nLOWRI: Depends how long it takes me to convince the Doctor to do it at all.\nVORENA: (D) What?\nDOCTOR: You can’t make me.\nVORENA: (D) Send him to me.\nVORENA: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 13\nVORENA: SCENE 6. INT. DETENTION AREA\nVORENA: APPROACHES.\nLEELA: Tegan?\nTEGAN: Leela! I thought everyone had forgotten about me.\nLEELA: One moment. (CALLS) Guards! Lower the containment barrier. (BEAT) I said lower it. If she tries to escape I will kill her myself.\nLEELA: That is better.\nTEGAN: (NERVOUS) Yeah.\nLEELA: (LOW) I will not really kill you. I just wanted them to do as I said.\nTEGAN: (LOW; STILL UNEASY) Good.\nLEELA: (LOW) But please do not try to escape, or I will look foolish.\nLEELA: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 14\nLEELA: SCENE 7. PRESIDENT’S OFFICE\nDOCTOR: I like the water feature, Vorena.\nVORENA: Your predecessor put it there. Doctor, I [appreciate —]\nDOCTOR: What used to be here?\nVORENA: The Harp of Rassilon.\nDOCTOR: Oh yes! So is this the Water Feature of Rassilon?\nVORENA: Stop changing the subject, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: All right. It’s obvious the whole idea is to keep me on a short leash. Make me think I’m in charge, but keep me tied up in bureaucracy so I’m not out in the universe embarrassing them.\nVORENA: (SIGHS) That is how some of the High Council view your appointment.\nDOCTOR: Of course [they —]\nVORENA: But I lobbied for you to be brought back as President.\nDOCTOR: Why?\nVORENA: Because Gallifrey is in trouble. We haven’t told the public what Borusa did, with the timescoop and the Death Zone [and —]\nDOCTOR: Why not?\nVORENA: Because we'd have to explain how we let it happen. And Borusa steered us through some major crises, don’t forget.\nDOCTOR: He had a little help.\nDOCTOR: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 15\nVORENA: But his reputation — it’s hard to fight that.\nDOCTOR: I suppose. Like trying to convince people Churchill had turned into Hitler.\nVORENA: What had turned into who?\nDOCTOR: Why does it have to be me who replaces him?\nVORENA: Borusa quietly laid the groundwork for himself to take absolute power. He undermined and discredited the High Council, he appointed weak people to office to make sure nobody was around to challenge him, and he left us in a constitutional mess.\nDOCTOR: Still, it’s hardly my [usual —]\nVORENA: He deliberately created a system only he could hold together. Without him, parts of Gallifrey are talking about becoming independent states, no longer under the High Council’s rule.\nDOCTOR: But that would be disastrous! The wars we used to have before unification — the whole galaxy could be affected if we had another.\nVORENA: We need a candidate from outside the Capitol to restore trust — a big personality. There aren’t a lot of those in Gallifreyan politics these days, but you [do —]\nDOCTOR: All right! As an interim measure. We start looking for my successor immediately.\nDOCTOR: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 16\nDOCTOR: SCENE 8. INT. DETENTION AREA\nLEELA: They tell me your application to enter Gallifrey is being considered.\nTEGAN: I spoke to someone who kept asking questions like had I been inoculated against diseases I’d never heard of, had I ever participated in illegal time experiments —\nLEELA: You told them no?\nTEGAN: Of course, but then he asked if I’d ever participated in the overthrow of any planetary ruler or system of government...\nLEELA: Oh.\nTEGAN: I mean, you travel around with the Doctor, it happens from time to time! Then they slung me in here with this computer-book thing and told me to read it.\nLEELA: What is it about?\nTEGAN: They want me to take an exam about Gallifreyan history and culture.\nTEGAN: It’s so confusing. Did Omega come after Rassilon or were they\nTEGAN: at the same time?\nLEELA: Would you like me to help?\nTEGAN: Yes please.\nLEELA: So. What is the maximum number of regenerations a Time Lord can have?\nLEELA: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 17\nTEGAN: Ah — now, I’m pretty sure this is a trick question.\nTEGAN: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL)\nTEGAN: SCENE 9. PRESIDENT’S OFFICE\nVORENA: First you’ll be introduced.\nDOCTOR: Right.\nVORENA: Using your full name.\nDOCTOR: Out of the question.\nVORENA: You can’t be called ‘President Doctor’.\nDOCTOR: Why not?\nVORENA: It’s two titles.\nDOCTOR: Page 18\nDOCTOR: They call people ‘Lord President’, that’s two titles.\nVORENA: ‘Lord President Doctor’ sounds even more absurd.\nDOCTOR: Having me as President is absurd, so that seems fitting.\nVORENA: Let’s get you measured for your robes of office.\nDOCTOR: Oh no — I’m not wearing the robes.\nDOCTOR: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 19\nDOCTOR: SCENE 10. INT. HOLDING CELL\nLEELA: ‘True or false: a Time Lord is born with two hearts.’\nTEGAN: Oh! I know this one. False, they develop the second after the first regeneration. — Don’t they?\nULLNER: You are... (PRONOUNCES THIS WRONG) ‘Tegg-anne Jovv-anne-ka’?\nTEGAN: Tegan Jovanka.\nULLNER: That’s what I said. My name is Ullner, and I’m here to tell you your application for Gallifreyan residency has been rejected.\nLEELA: But she has not done the test yet.\nULLNER: You failed the background check.\nTEGAN: So what’1l happen to me?\nULLNER: Don’t worry — we're just going to wipe your memory of everything that’s happened since you met the Doctor and return you to Earth.\nTEGAN: You can’t do that!\nULLNER: Standard procedure I’m afraid.\nLEELA: You must tell the Doctor — the President — about this.\nULLNER: He’s in the Panopticon, giving his inaugural address.\nTEGAN: You mean we’re missing it?\nTEGAN: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 20\nULLNER: You’re not the only one. I never miss an inauguration, but thanks to [you —]\nTEGAN: Put it on the screen!\nULLNER: Don’t take that tone with me.\nLEELA: Please, could you put it on the screen.\nULLNER: All right.\nULLNER: INTO LIFE. DOCTOR IS GIVING HIS SPEECH, WITHOUT MUCH ENTHUSIASM.\nDOCTOR: (D) It is of course an honour to be welcomed into the role of President...\nDOCTOR: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 21\nDOCTOR: SCENE 11. INT. PANOPTICON [CONTINUOUS]\nDOCTOR: I was going to say, welcomed for the second time. But I’m told that my previous occupancy of the highest office on Gallifrey doesn’t count, and has been stricken from the record.\nASSEMBLED: TIME LORDS (MURMURING) Really?/ Quite right, too!/ When was this?\nDOCTOR: It’s a source of great pride to my old chapter, the Prydonians, that they’ve supplied more Presidents than any other. However, my Prydonian privileges were revoked after I stole my TARDIS and left Gallifrey, so it’s a shame they cannot add me to their total.\nASSEMBLED: TIME LORDS\nASSEMBLED: (MURMURING — SOME DISGRUNTLED, SOME AMUSED) So who does he belong to?/ One in the eye for them!/ Typical Prydonian, no class whatsoever.\nDOCTOR: I attended the Academy, like you all. It was a decidedly mixed experience for me. Other institutions might have served me better — but only the Academy can confer the title of Time Lord. And that’s why my first act as President will be to allow other institutions to apply for Academy status.\nASSEMBLED: TIME LORDS (CONSIDERABLE DISQUIET) He’s joking, isn’t he?/ I mean, he can’t!/ Utterly ridiculous!\nDOCTOR: The institution currently known as just the Academy will be renamed the Prydonian Academy, as it has been informally known for many years anyway, and...\nASSEMBLED: TIME LORDS (LOUD DISQUIET) Total outrage! / Did the High Council know about this?\nDOCTOR: (REALISES HUBBUB MEANS NOBODY IS LISTENING) Fine, talk amongst yourselves.\nDOCTOR: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 22\nDOCTOR: SCENE 12. INT. HOLDING CELL [CONTINUOUS]\nDOCTOR: STARTS TO COMMENTATE OVER THE TOP.\nARCANTIS: (D) Gosh. Well, plenty of talking points there from what’s certainly the most eventful inaugural address we’ve had in several centuries, and we’ll be getting reaction to that —\nULLNER: He’s going to be a disaster. A disaster...\nTEGAN: I hope the Doctor hasn’t forgotten about me.\nLEELA: Of course he hasn’t. We’1l think of a way round this.\nTEGAN: Did you have this problem when you came to live here?\nLEELA: No, it was much easier because — I have an excellent idea.\nLEELA: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 23\nLEELA: SCENE 13. INT. CORRIDOR\nLOWRI: Lord President!\nDOCTOR: Ah, Castellan, my Castellan. How do you think that went?\nLOWRI: You should have discussed any policy announcement with the High Counca:.\nDOCTOR: Everyone was looking bored so I thought I’d liven things up.\nLOWRI: You can’t just create new academies!\nDOCTOR: It should have been done aeons ago. You said people are becoming disgruntled with the elite around here. Expanding the academy system to Gallifreyans from different backgrounds will create Time Lords with fresh outlooks.\nLOWRI: But won’t it devalue the status of Time Lord if you have several institutions appointing their own?\nDOCTOR: Yes, probably. So you’1l all have to work a bit harder at becoming interesting and worthwhile people in your own right, won’t you?\nLEELA: (OFF) There you are, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Leela! (TO LOWRI) Excuse me, I need to talk to my friend.\nLOWRI: But we need clarification [on —]\nDOCTOR: I’ll clarify everything for you later. (TO LEELA) Where’s\nDOCTOR: Tegan?\nLEELA: That is why I came. (THEY ENTER THE ROOM. INTO: )\nLEELA: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 24\nLEELA: SCENE 14. INT. PRESIDENT’S CHAMBERS [CONTINUOUS]\nDOCTOR: I haven’t spoken to you properly since I arrived. It’s good to see you.\nLEELA: And you too.\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry — I’ve been back twice recently and wanted to catch up but, you know, things got in the way.\nLEELA: They always do, with you.\nDOCTOR: But you’re keeping well? How’s Andred?\nLEELA: He and K9 are away with a squad cleaning up the Death Zone. There are creatures still lurking in its darker recesses.\nDOCTOR: Did they find that Raston Warrior Robot?\nLEELA: No.\nDOCTOR: Oh dear.\nLEELA: I found it. A worthy opponent. I have its head mounted on the wall of my kitchen.\nDOCTOR: Of course you have. Did you see my speech?\nLEELA: Part of it —\nDOCTOR: Put the cat among the pigeons!\nLEELA: But there is a more urgent issue — they will not let Tegan stay.\nDOCTOR: I should have known they’d be tedious about this.\nDOCTOR: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 25\nLEELA: They intend to erase her memory and send her back to Earth.\nDOCTOR: What? I’ll get the Castellan to lodge an appeal, she’1ll know how to do it all [properly —]\nLEELA: I have a much simpler idea that will solve everything.\nDOCTOR: Excellent.\nLEELA: You and Tegan could be married.\nDOCTOR: (BEAT) Right.\nLEELA: It is a very good idea, isn’t it.\nDOCTOR: I’m not sure I’d say very good.\nLEELA: But you do want her to stay?\nDOCTOR: Of course, it’s just... marriage?\nLEELA: It wouldn’t have to be a proper marriage.\nDOCTOR: It wouldn’t be a proper marriage.\nLEELA: Is there a problem?\nDOCTOR: Excuse me, Leela, this looks urgent. (INTO COMMS) Yes, hello, Lord President of Gallifrey here.\nCREX: (D) My name’s Crex, Lord President. I need to speak with you,\nCREX: privately.\nDOCTOR: Certainly. Sorry, Leela, duty calls. You can see yourself out...?\nDOCTOR: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 26\nCREX: (D) Lord President?\nDOCTOR: Crex, yes! The good news is you’ve just interrupted a conversation I didn’t want to have, so I’m already well disposed to whatever you have to say.\nCREX: (D) Good! You must abandon your plan to create new Academies.\nDOCTOR: Right. Not that well disposed.\nCREX: (D) You must.\nDOCTOR: I suppose you’re going to foretell doom if I suggest things should be done differently from how they’ve been done for millennia, are you?\nCREX: (D) Lord President — I’m part of the High Council’s Policy Adjustment Bureau.\nDOCTOR: I’ve never heard of it.\nCREX: (D) Only the President has access to our findings.\nDOCTOR: Findings?\nCREX: (D) We travel back in time and prevent Presidents from taking decisions which have negative consequences.\nDOCTOR: Really.\nCREX: (D) I’ve come from the near future of Gallifrey to advise you to drop this plan immediately — and no previous President has ever ignored our advice.\nCREX: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 27\nCREX: SCENE 16. INT. HOLDING CELL\nULLNER: Time to go, Jov-anne-ka!\nTEGAN: But what about the Doctor?\nULLNER: I sent a message up to the President, but I’ve heard nothing back.\nTEGAN: He wouldn’t just leave me like this, without saying goodbye.\nULLNER: What difference does it make? You won’t remember him anyway, after this.\nTEGAN: Please — give him a bit of time, I’m sure he’1ll come —\nULLNER: We have no time.\nTEGAN: But you’re the Time Lords!\nULLNER: Your attitude is doing you no favours, you know. Do as I say or I’1ll make sure you forget more than just your time with the Doctor.\nULLNER: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 28\nULLNER: SCENE 17. INT. COUNCIL CHAMBERS\nDOCTOR: How long has this Policy Adjustment Bureau existed, Castellan?\nLOWRI: I’ve no idea. There’s nothing in the official records. Or the unofficial ones.\nDOCTOR: I’m President now, I need to know these things. Vorena? Did you know about this?\nVORENA: No. It’s not even mentioned in the Black Files, which officially unexist and which you can only read by visiting an office at the heart of an asteroid in a pocket dimension which is the only surviving remnant of a redundant timeline.\nLOWRI: I’ve never seen those.\nVORENA: They’re nowhere near as exciting as you’d expect.\nDOCTOR: So the Policy Adjustment Bureau is so secret, only the President knows about it? It’s a disgrace! It means the President can appear almost infallible!\nLOWRI: Also, it directly contravenes the Laws Of Time.\nDOCTOR: Of course, and you’d never catch me breaking those. (CLEARS\nTHROAT: )\nVORENA: So what are you proposing?\nDOCTOR: I’m shutting down the Policy Adjustment Bureau with immediate effect.\nCREX: That’s a bad idea, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Ah, I thought you might make an appearance.\nDOCTOR: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 29\nLOWRI: Who is this?\nDOCTOR: This, Lowri, is Crex from the P.A.B.\nVORENA: You look familiar.\nCREX: I don’t think so.\nVORENA: Chancellor Vorena. Didn’t we go for dinner once?\nCREX: You must be thinking of someone else.\nVORENA: I’m sure we did.\nCREX: I’m trying to warn the President he’s making a dreadful mistake.\nDOCTOR: I’m not.\nCREX: You were told not to inform anyone else of the existence of the P.A.B.\nDOCTOR: Yes. I ignored you. And now I’m getting rid of you.\nCREX: The P.A.B. has protected Presidents for several generations —\nDOCTOR: From what? Themselves? Who are you to decide what’s a good or bad decision?\nCREX: If you’d seen the future for yourself —\nDOCTOR: But that’s not allowed, is it?\nCREX: Naturally the President himself cannot be seen to contravene the Laws of Time.\nCREX: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 30\nDOCTOR: So I just have to take your word for it? I cannot allow this kind of power to reside with a secretive autonomous body.\nCREX: That’s a shame, Doctor.\nLOWRI: Lord President — he’s armed!\nDOCTOR: He won’t shoot me, don’t worry.\nCREX: No. I’ve got a better idea. I’m going to go back to before Borusa decided to play the Game Of Rassilon and warn him how it’ll end.\nVORENA: We can’t have Borusa back.\nCREX: Too late.\nDOCTOR: You're right, it is too late. Because I suspected you’d use your facilities to try and stop me, and that’s why I gave my friend Leela a Time Ring —\nCREX: What?\nLEELA: Move and I will slit your throat.\nCREX: (STARTLED) Aah!\nDOCTOR: Take his Time Ring, Leela.\nCREX: No, you can’t!\nDOCTOR: (TO LEELA) Throw it here, please.\nLEELA: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 31\nDOCTOR: (CATCHING IT) Thank you. Crude compared to a TARDIS, but they are rather more stealthy than —\nLEELA: (WINDED) Oof!\nCREX: Don’t try to follow me — or I’11 shoot!\nCREX: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 32\nCREX: SCENE 18. INT. CAPITOL CORRIDOR [CONTINUOUS]\nCREX: Out of my way!\nARCANTIS: Don’t shoot! I only have two regenerations left!\nCREX: Don’t I know you from [the —]\nARCANTIS: Vidcasts, yes, I [present —]\nCREX: I need a TARDIS.\nARCANTIS: I left mine at home — honestly, the parking at the Capitol these days [is —]\nCREX: Which way to the nearest landing bay?\nARCANTIS: Over there.\nARCANTIS: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 33\nARCANTIS: SCENE 19. INT. LANDING BAY\nCREX: Yes! Now...\nCREX: CREX. THIS ONE SOUNDS DIFFERENT — TIRED, BEATEN.\nCREX: What the... What the hell are you doing here?\nANOTHER: CREX Crex.. I came to warn you.\nCREX: Warn me about what, Crex?\nANOTHER: CREX The future. We were wrong.\nCREX: Wrong?\nANOTHER: CREX If you restore Borusa, the Bureau will become a tool of destruction and repression.\nCREX: No...\nANOTHER: CREX Our work will become perverted. We can’t trust him. You must let the Doctor end it.\nCREX: No — this can’t be right.\nANOTHER: CREX Think. Be honest with yourself... You worked with Borusa — you know how this will end.\nCREX: (BEAT) Yes. I do.\nCREX: LOWRI, VORENA AND LEELA.\nVORENA: Where did he go?\nVORENA: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 34\nDOCTOR: Once he made the decision to allow the Bureau to be dismantled, Vorena, the future he came from was redundant. The Bureau that sent him back will no longer exist.\nLOWRI: It was lucky that other him intervened when he did.\nLEELA: It was not luck.\nDOCTOR: You think Leela would’ve let him go if we didn’t know this would happen? Give her some credit, please.\nLOWRI: sorry.\nLEELA: I am not offended.\nDOCTOR: She and I planned this. The other Crex was a Matrix projection — I programmed him to say those things. Now! Castellan Lowri, can I entrust you with the task of dismantling the P.A.B.?\nLOWRI: Absolutely. As soon as we find their office.\nDOCTOR: I’m sure they can’t hide from you for long. Now! I must go and see Tegan, check how her appeal is progressing.\nLOWRI: Appeal?\nDOCTOR: I sent you a message, asking you to lodge an appeal while I think of a way to contest her deportation.\nLOWRI: I didn’t receive any message.\nDOCTOR: (BEAT) Come on!\nDOCTOR: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 35\nDOCTOR: SCENE 20. INT. DEPORTATION BAY\nULLNER: Sorry this is taking so long.\nTEGAN: No no, take your time.\nULLNER: It’s slightly complicated by your time spent away from the Doctor, which technically you are entitled to keep — I can probably smooth it over, though...\nTEGAN: Actually, don’t worry about that — it wasn’t the best of years.\nULLNER: Right, we’re ready to start. Now, hold still —\nDOCTOR: Wait!\nTEGAN: Doctor! What took you so long?\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry, Tegan, it’s been a busy day.\nULLNER: Lord President. I’m honoured by your presence — you’re here to say farewell to your human?\nLEELA: Farewell?\nULLNER: I’m preparing her for deportation now.\nDOCTOR: No. Stop this.\nULLNER: On what grounds?\nDOCTOR: I’m the President. I don’t need grounds.\nDOCTOR: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 36\nLOWRI: Lord President —\nDOCTOR: Oh for heaven’s sake, Lowri, call me Doctor. Why didn’t you stop this?\nLOWRI: I tell you I did not get the message!\nLEELA: We can stop it now, can’t we?\nLOWRI: Please — controls on immigration are an important issue to ordinary Gallifreyans and this is a delicate moment to be seen circumventing procedure.\nDOCTOR: There must be a way.\nLEELA: Marriage.\nDOCTOR: Another way.\nTEGAN: What did Leela say?\nDOCTOR: Nothing! Lowri — you’re the one who pulled me out of time and Space with Tegan in tow, this is your fault — you think of something.\nLOWRI: Me?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know all the legislation — you do. How can we get around this?\nLOWRI: (PAUSE) Ullner?\nULLNER: Yes, Castellan?\nLOWRI: I’m conferring ambassadorial status on this human.\nDOCTOR: Yes - brilliant!\nDOCTOR: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 37\nTEGAN: I’m an ambassador?\nULLNER: We don’t even have diplomatic relations with her species.\nDOCTOR: No, but we might do. And when it happens, we’ll be ready.\nULLNER: (SIGHS) Very well, you’re free to go.\nTEGAN: Seriously?\nULLNER: Yes, you’ve wasted enough of my time.\nLEELA: Do not speak to the Ambassador this way.\nULLNER: sorry.\nTEGAN: sorry, “ma’am”.\nULLNER: Sorry.. ma’am.\nTEGAN: That’s better.\nTEGAN: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 38\nTEGAN: 2: Past Indiscretions\nTEGAN: SCENE 1.

But not to go and be polite toa self-styled ‘elite species’ who’ve been lording it over their corner of the galaxy for several millennia.\nLOWRI: The ceremony’s very short. And it would really shore up your image with those who aren’t sure about your appointment — there are still some Gallifreyans who remember that war.\nDOCTOR: Really?\nLOWRI: Some.\nDOCTOR: How old are they?\nLOWRI: Some people don’t fritter away their regenerations as recklessly as you have.

INT. HANGAR\nLOWRI: INSIDE. LEELA AND TEGAN WALK THROUGH IT.\nDOCTOR: Ah! Tegan, Leela. Glad you could make it.\nTEGAN: Woah! What is this thing?\nDOCTOR: It’s a WARDIS.\nLOWRI: That’s not the actual name.\nDOCTOR: No, but it stuck — it’s a military TARDIS. Have you been in one before, Leela?\nLEELA: (THRILLED) No — I have heard of them, but never seen one...\nTEGAN: There are military TARDISes?\nDOCTOR: Don’t worry, it’s decommissioned.\nLOWRI: They’re all decommissioned.\nDOCTOR: Officially.\nLOWRI: And actually.\nDOCTOR: You might want to check that. (TO TEGAN) But yes, this one’s no longer active — the plasma cannons are just for show, they don’t fire.\nTEGAN: Mightn’t we need weapons? Not that I want to use them, but the people we’re meeting sound like a nasty bunch.\nDOCTOR: They are.\nDOCTOR: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 42\nLOWRI: Don’t worry — I’ve sent a squadron of the Chancellery Guard to prepare for our arrival, and in fact they’1ll be waiting for us so we really should leave.\nDOCTOR: No rush, we’re travelling in a time machine.\nLOWRI: I don’t want to travel in time if I can possibly help it.\nLEELA: Why not?\nLOWRI: t's just.— Lt?s: protocol ;\nDOCTOR: No it isn’t, we’re perfectly [free —]\nLOWRI: I don’t like doing time travel, all right?\nTEGAN: But... you’re a Time Lord. Lady. Whatever.\nLOWRI: I just hate the thought of less time having passed for other people than for me. I like to keep things... straight, so can we please get in there and set off?\nDOCTOR: Fine. Come on.\nLEELA: It is very big on the outside.\nDOCTOR: I know, and it’s still bigger on the inside.\nDOCTOR: INTO:\nDOCTOR: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 43\nDOCTOR: SCENE 4. INT. MILITARY TARDIS [CONTINUOUS]\nTEGAN: Wow. It’s nicely done out.\nLOWRI: Oh yes, it’s purely for state functions now, so they had to some comfy chairs in and so on.\nDOCTOR: Do you need any help?\nLOWRI: Noy, LoL pile 2b.\nDOCTOR: I only asked.\nLEELA: Why is she being so cross?\nDOCTOR: She thinks I’m going to try to escape.\nTEGAN: Not a totally unreasonable assumption.\nLOWRI: I can manage on my own. Relax and take a seat.\nLEELA: So was this ship used in the war against the Arimcei?\nDOCTOR: Oh yes.\nLEELA: How exciting.\nTEGAN: Wasn’t much of a war though, was it? Beat them pretty quick, from what I hear.\nDOCTOR: How do you know?\nDOCTOR: put\nDOCTOR: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 44\nTEGAN: I’m taking this ambassador stuff seriously, you know. I thought I ought to read up.\nLEELA: I hear people talk of the war, but I don’t know what it was about.\nDOCTOR: They’re a pretty unpleasant bunch. Not many of them left now, they set themselves up as gods over their corner of the galaxy.\nTEGAN: See, they draw their power from the faith of all the religions that’ve been set up in their name.\nDOCTOR: Their followers have been declaring religious wars on each other for millennia, and the Arimcei just let it happen.\nLEELA: Ugh.\nTEGAN: So then they tried to set up a religion on Gallifrey.\nDOCTOR: And we didn’t like that, so we declared war. But that was when a lot of Time Lords were pushing for a policy of non- intervention, and so the war with the Arimcei didn’t last long before we negotiated a peace.\nTEGAN: Which they were grateful to take. They were being thrashed.\nDOCTOR: But they pretended it was a draw and we shook hands and went our separate ways.\nLEELA: And they keep acting like gods?\nTEGAN: A lot of the religions that sustained them have died out now, but there’s one planet where it’s still going strong, and that seems to keep them going.\nDOCTOR: This ceremony’s one of the very few times they take corporeal form. Mostly they remain intangible, and just whisper in the ear of the people who worship them.\nDOCTOR: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 45\nLEELA: And people just do as they say?\nTEGAN: Something about the quality of their voice hits a part of the brain that makes you believe you’ve spoken to a god.\nDOCTOR: And we go through this rigmarole to remember the conflict and flatter them they’re somehow our equals. You see why I didn’t want to go.\nLOWRI: (OFF) Doctor, if you’ve quite finished complaining, we’re about to land.\nDOCTOR: Come on then. Let’s get it over with and we can be home in time for tea and scones.\nDOCTOR: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 46\nDOCTOR: SCENE 5. EXT. PEACE GARDEN\nDOCTOR: OPEN.\nGUARD: CAPTAIN CAPTAIN The Lord President of Gallifrey!\nGUARD: CAPTAIN CAPTAIN Greetings, Lord President, our lives are at [your —]\nDOCTOR: Yes, very good.\nTEGAN: Oh. It’s quite nice.\nDOCTOR: What were you expecting?\nTEGAN: I don’t know. All I knew about this place was there was a huge battle here. Which was a long time ago, I guess, so ignore me.\nLOWRI: This is a peace garden now — covers about twenty acres.\nLEELA: If you think gardens are peaceful, then you have never talked to a spider.\nTEGAN: (BEAT) Have you ever talked to a spider?\nSUGRU: (APPROACHING) Representatives of the Time Lords of Gallifrey!\nSUGRU: I am Sugru, ambassador of the Arimcei.\nLOWRI: I am Castellan Lowri, honoured ambassador Sugru. It gives us great pleasure to meet with you once again in peace and fraternity, and present our Lord [President —]\nDOCTOR: (CUTTING HER OFF) The Doctor. Hello.\nDOCTOR: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 47\nSUGRU: Doctor...\nDOCTOR: Yes. And this is —\nTEGAN: Tegan Jovanka, official Earth ambassador to the Time Lords. Pleasure to meet you.\nLEELA: And I am Leela, of the Sevateem.\nSUGRU: Leela.\nLEELA: Yes.\nSUGRU: Of the Sevateem.\nLEELA: Yes.\nSUGRU: (PAUSE) You killed my brother.\nLEELA: I did?\nLOWRI: There must be some mistake.\nSUGRU: No mistake.\nDOCTOR: I can vouch for her, she wouldn’t harm a fly.\nSUGRU: In his final message to his brethren he named those who slew him. A quick-witted knife-wielder named Leela —\nLEELA: (PLEASED) Quick-witted.\nSUGRU: And a clownish man who prattled and chuckled, named the Doctor.\nSUGRU: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 48\nDOCTOR: Ah, well now I know you’ve got the wrong people.\nSUGRU: I know my brother’s killers! You will pay for what you did to Inec!\nDOCTOR: (BEAT) Oh — Inec!\nLEELA: Yes! I remember Inec.\nLOWRI: Doctor — is there something you should have told me?\nDOCTOR: These things slip your mind —\nLOWRI: Really? Do they really?\nDOCTOR: It was a long time ago, I don’t even really [remember —]\nLEELA: We were in a place called Japan. And Inec had come there looking for Azal, the last of the Daemons, because of some personal grudge between them.\nDOCTOR: I don’t think he wants to know [about —]\nSUGRU: I want you to admit your crimes.\nLEELA: And when he couldn’t find him, tried to build a dimensional gate to take himself home, [but —]\nTEGAN: Hey, Leela, this might be an anecdote for another time.\nLOWRI: Yes. Ambassador, why don’t you talk to Tegan here -\nTEGAN: What?\nLOWRI: — while I confer with the Lord President and Leela.\nLOWRI: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 49\nTEGAN: Where are you going?\nLOWRI: Just do a bit of diplomacy, we’1ll be back in a moment.\nDOCTOR: (OFF) Don’t worry, Tegan — we’ll straighten all this out.\nLEELA: (OFF) He does look like his brother.\nTEGAN: OK, so —\nSUGRU: You dare mock us with this outrage?\nTEGAN: We wouldn’t dream of mocking you. You don’t look even slightly mockable. With your... nine heavily armoured limbs and your head made of fire.\nSUGRU: This day of remembrance is utterly sullied.\nTEGAN: Although, on the bright side, haven’t we been lucky with the weather?\nTEGAN: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 50\nTEGAN: SCENE 6. EXT. PEACE GARDEN (QUIET CORNER)\nLOWRI: So, you two killed his brother.\nLEELA: Not on purpose, Lowri.\nLOWRI: Oh, good grief.\nDOCTOR: Leela’s right — it was eighteenth century Japan.\nLEELA: I liked it there.\nDOCTOR: And his brother was trying to escape through a dimensional gate.\nLEELA: But he was powering it with the souls of the dead.\nDOCTOR: Well it was a bit more complex than that, but essentially, yes. And he was proposing to kill thousands to get enough power...\nCROSS TO: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 51\nCROSS TO: SCENE 7. INT. CAVE [FLASHBACK]\nCROSS TO: WITH SAMURAI SWORDS.\nLEELA: Your skill is pitiful — you do not deserve to wield such a fine weapon.\nINEC: Argh! I will drain your primitive energies —\nINEC: And you shall power my escape from this world!\nLEELA: (SHOUTS) Now, Doctor!\nINEC: What?\nLEELA: (EFFORT — KICKS HIM INTO THE GATE) Hah!!!\nCROSS BACK TO: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 52\nCROSS BACK TO: SCENE 8. EXT. PEACE GARDEN (QUIET CORNER)\nLEELA: I distracted him while the Doctor did something clever to his gate, then I kicked him into it —\nDOCTOR: And the gate trapped him in a pocket dimension.\nLOWRI: So he’s not dead?\nDOCTOR: Well he is, because his own attempts to escape caused the pocket dimension to collapse.\nLEELA: Good riddance.\nLOWRI: Keep your voice down.\nDOCTOR: He really was a rum chap, we had to do something. He must have managed to get a message home before the collapse.\nLEELA: I did not know he was one of these Arimcei people.\nDOCTOR: Yes, you see I pretended not to recognise his species, in case he realised I was a Time Lord. It sets them off rather.\nLOWRI: How could you have forgotten all this?\nDOCTOR: I’ve foiled an awful lot of tyrants and homicidal maniacs, Lowri, they don’t all stand out.\nLOWRI: Go back there and apologise.\nLEELA: No!\nDOCTOR: Leela, I think we have to.\nDOCTOR: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 53\nDOCTOR: SCENE 9. EXT. PEACE GARDEN\nTEGAN: So, Ambassador Sugru... you ever been to Earth?\nSUGRU: It is where my brother died. The very mention of it fills me with loathing.\nTEGAN: Right... That’s a shame.\nSUGRU: The murderers are returning.\nTEGAN: Oh good.\nDOCTOR: (TO SUGRU) Hello again, Ambassador. Leela and I have something we would like to say.\nLEELA: Yes.\nDOCTOR: I assure you that your brother’s death was an unfortunate accident.\nSUGRU: That isn’t what he said.\nDOCTOR: And we are very sorry for your loss. Aren’t we?\nLEELA: Very sorry.\nDOCTOR: And we hope this apology is accepted in the spirit of ongoing peace between our two peoples.\nSUGRU: This is no apology.\nLEELA: Why not?\nLEELA: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 54\nSUGRU: You haven’t apologised for what you’ve done, you’ve just expressed your sorrow for what I experienced!\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry he died.\nSUGRU: You killed him!\nDOCTOR: I didn’t.\nTEGAN: (LOW) Doctor, maybe [just —]\nSUGRU: Presenting this killer to us as your President is an insult.\nDOCTOR: Aha! Then I tender my immediate resignation.\nLOWRI: Doctor!\nSUGRU: Not good enough.\nLEELA: Then I also tender my immediate resignation.\nLOWRI: You don’t have a job.\nSUGRU: You will hand them both over to my custody and I will have their heads.\nTEGAN: What if we refuse?\nSUGRU: That will be considered an act of war. Hand them over.\nDOCTOR: Leela had nothing to do with it.\nLEELA: Yes I did.\nDOCTOR: She’s always exaggerating, you can’t believe a word she says. Take me, leave her.\nDOCTOR: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 55\nSUGRU: Inec named you both, I’1l take you both.\nDOCTOR: You could compromise.\nSUGRU: I could.\nTEGAN: Yes.\nSUGRU: But I don’t want to. I want to watch you both die for what you did.\nLOWRI: (SIGHS) Can we have some time to consider?\nSUGRU: There’s nothing to consider. I will accept nothing less.\nLOWRI: Even so — we would like to confer.\nTEGAN: (LOW) Do I have to stay here again?\nLOWRI: No, come with us.\nSUGRU: Talk all you want. I will kill you here or on the battlefield!\nSUGRU: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 56\nSUGRU: SCENE 10. EXT. PEACE GARDEN (QUIET CORNER)\nGUARD: CAPTAIN.\nLOWRI: Guard Captain — cover that archway. The Arimcei aren’t very patient, he may come and take them by force.\nGUARD: CAPTAIN Yes, Castellan.\nDOCTOR: Right — what do we do?\nTEGAN: I’m usually the one asking that.\nDOCTOR: I know, Tegan, but Lowri knows all the protocol and so on.\nLOWRI: I’ve no idea. I’ve never had to deal with anything like this before.\nTEGAN: With the Doctor, that happens at least twice a day.\nLEELA: We cannot hand the Doctor over. If they want war, give them war.\nDOCTOR: No.\nLEELA: But we would win! They are nothing.\nDOCTOR: I will not be the first President in goodness knows how long to take Gallifrey to war.\nLOWRI: Tegan — why don’t you take the TARDIS back to Gallifrey and talk to Vorena?\nTEGAN: Me?\nLOWRI: Someone should go, and I think I should stay here.\nLOWRI: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 57\nTEGAN: I tried piloting a TARDIS before — it didn’t go well.\nLEELA: It is not as complicated as the Doctor makes out.\nDOCTOR: It is quite complicated.\nLEELA: He just likes doing all the driving himself.\nLOWRI: Use the Fast Return Switch, top right hand side of the panel opposite the door. It’ll take you back to the previous landing\nLOWRI: site.\nTEGAN: Fast Return. Got it.\nLOWRI: Vorena may have some ideas on how to deal with this. I’1l stall\nLOWRI: for as much time as I can.\nTEGAN: OK.\nLEELA: I have another suggestion.\nDOCTOR: Not war?\nLEELA: No — I challenge him to one-on-one combat.\nLOWRI: This is a Peace Garden!\nLEELA: We could fight somewhere else. I bested his brother.\nDOCTOR: His brother was weakened.\nLEELA: I am not afraid. He would have to accept or his honour would be\nLEELA: wounded.\nLEELA: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 58\nDOCTOR: You do realise he might not have any honour.\nLOWRI: It’s a better solution than any we have thus far, although I doubt he’1ll accept.\nLEELA: Doctor. Let me do this.\nDOCTOR: (BEAT) All right.\nLOWRI: You stay here. I’1l go and talk to him.\nLOWRI: (TO GUARD CAPTAIN) Guard Captain! Make sure you keep an eye on them.\nGUARD: CAPTAIN Yes, Castellan.\nGUARD: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 59\nGUARD: SCENE 11. INT. VORENA’S OFFICE\nVORENA: The Lord President absolutely refutes these allegations from the Arimeci.. he was not responsible for the death of Inec... and he will do everything in his power to find the true killer and bring them to [justice —]\nTEGAN: Vorena! I just got here from the memorial. There’s a bit of a Situation down there.\nVORENA: Yes, I know. Tegan, isn’t it?\nTEGAN: Ambassador Jovanka, yes, but you can call me Tegan.\nVORENA: How generous of you. I’ve been monitoring the situation, I’m already preparing the President’s statement.\nTEGAN: But he’s not even here.\nVORENA: No, but we need to get the denial out there, we can’t wait for him.\nTEGAN: The Arimcei know he was involved though, he’s admitted it.\nVORENA: We don’t need to deny it to them. It’s the rest of Gallifrey we need to tell.\nTEGAN: Why?\nVORENA: There’s a faction of the High Council opposed to the Doctor’s Presidency. If they get wind of this, they’1ll have a field day.\nTEGAN: I see.\nVORENA: There are those who’ll say we should hand him over and save a diplomatic incident.\nVORENA: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 60\nTEGAN: What do you say?\nVORENA: I think that’s a dreadful idea. It’ll be a significant show of weakness and could be a slippery slope. Other species might see it and start challenging us.\nTEGAN: And it’d put the Doctor and Leela in danger.\nVORENA: That too, yes.\nTEGAN: So what do we do?\nVORENA: I don’t know.\nTEGAN: I did have a thought on the way here.\nVORENA: I suppose I may as well hear it.\nVORENA: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 6l\nVORENA: SCENE 12. EXT. PEACE GARDEN\nLOWRI: Greetings, Ambassador.\nSUGRU: You haven’t brought the criminals.\nLOWRI: No, but —\nSUGRU: Then war it is.\nLOWRI: Wait — wait! We have an alternative proposal.\nSUGRU: I’m not interested.\nLOWRI: Leela has challenged you to combat.\nSUGRU: Why?\nLOWRI: To settle this. Like a duel. A lot of cultures have that.\nSUGRU: I see. We do not.\nLOWRI: Right. You could always start.\nSUGRU: Why would I agree to face her in combat when I could make you hand her over and then kill her without any risk to myself?\nLOWRI: Honour...?\nSUGRU: Your concept of honour is meaningless.\nLOWRI: Maybe, but, you know... she is just a human woman... I’d have thought you could kill her quite easily unless... unless you’re scared...\nLOWRI: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 62\nSUGRU: (ANGRY) You dare suggest I’m scared of her.\nLOWRI: No, no. I mean, you could easily prove you’re not scared of her\nLOWRI: [by —]\nSUGRU: You dare suggest I’m [scared —]\nLOWRI: No — sorry, I didn’t mean scared, what’s the word I’m looking for? Busy. Yes. I can see you’re too busy to have a duel, so I’1l just, I’1l — yep.\nLOWRI: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 63\nLOWRI: SCENE 13. INT. VORENA’S OFFICE\nVORENA: Actually... that might work.\nTEGAN: You think so, Vorena?\nVORENA: You understand, though — this conversation never happened.\nTEGAN: Why not?\nVORENA: Gallifrey can’t be seen to act. Officially, you’re a lone wolf.\nTEGAN: I like that.\nVORENA: Officially, you stole that military TARDIS and you also stole these co-ordinates I’m about to give you.\nTEGAN: Right. (BEAT) How did I do that?\nVORENA: Does it matter?\nTEGAN: If anyone asks, I mean this is a pretty tight ship you run here, seems unlikely you’d just leave it lying around —\nVORENA: I don’t know — you hacked the system.\nTEGAN: ‘Hacked’? What does that mean?\nVORENA: Look — no-one will ask. Particularly not if this works.\nTEGAN: What if it doesn’t?\nTEGAN: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 64\nVORENA: Hard to say, but since you’re the Earth ambassador to Gallifrey, and you appear to make a point of telling everyone this, the Arimcei may declare war on your planet and head over there to conquer it.\nTEGAN: (BEAT) OK! No pressure at all then.\nTEGAN: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 65\nTEGAN: SCENE 14. EXT. PEACE GARDEN (QUIET CORNER)\nLOWRI: It’s just as I thought, he’s got no interest in... (BREAKS OFF) Guard! Where are the President, and Leela?\nGUARD: CAPTAIN Um, about that.\nLOWRI: They’ve escaped, haven’t they?\nGUARD: CAPTAIN To be fair, you told me to stop anyone getting in.\nLOWRI: And to keep an eye on them! Look — never mind. We just need to find them. Get everyone to scour the garden, they can’t have got far.\nLOWRI: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 66\nLOWRI: SCENE 15. INT. PEACE GARDEN (SHED)\nLOWRI: VOICES.\nDOCTOR: We’ve got quite far, haven’t we? Well done us.\nLEELA: What is this building?\nDOCTOR: It’s a shed. And over here... yes — a disposal chute for garden waste. We can get out that way.\nLEELA: I do not like running away, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Don’t you? It’s very underrated, I think.\nLEELA: There are many implements here that would make excellent weapons. See, over there — with a few modifications, that could be an effective tank.\nDOCTOR: It’s a ride-on lawnmower.\nLEELA: Its churning blades would be a fearsome sight as we rode into battle.\nDOCTOR: I’m not sure we’d be such a fearsome sight, riding into battle at three miles per hour. No, I think this is a conflict we should just remove ourselves from.\nLEELA: But what about Gallifrey? The Arimcei will think they have let us escape —\nDOCTOR: Gallifrey can look after itself.\nLEELA: But I have to go back there!\nDOCTOR: You don’t have to. There’s always room in my TARDIS.\nLEELA: Which is on Gallifrey. Along with Andred, and my entire life!\nLEELA: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 67\nSUGRU: Aha! I knew you would try to hide in here.\nDOCTOR: Did you?\nSUGRU: Come. Back to the memorial.\nSUGRU: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 68\nSUGRU: SCENE 16. EXT. BATTLEFIELD\nSUGRU: EPISODE. USCAN AND CARTH ARE FIGHTING.\nCARTH: I’1l beat your heathen face to a pulp!\nCARTH: CARTH and USCAN\nUSCAN: It is we the gods protect!\nCARTH: Ha! Where is your ‘god’ now?\nBATTLE: CEASE AS EVERYONE STOPS TO LOOK AT IT.\nUSCAN: It cannot be...\nCARTH: It’s some kind of... heavenly chariot!\nUSCAN: (SHOUTS) Bow down before the messenger of the gods!\nCARTH: What?\nPROSTRATES: THEMSELVES. TEGAN EMERGES FROM THE TARDIS.\nTEGAN: Er... hi?\nUSCAN: Heavenly visitor — your true servants are at your command.\nCARTH: No, we are the true — (SHOUTS) Bow down! Everyone!\nPROSTRATES: THEMSELVES.\nPROSTRATES: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 69\nTEGAN: OK! Great. Now, if I [could —]\nCARTH: No, bow lower! Show the angel how much more devout we are!\nUSCAN: How dare you engage in this false display of piety —\nCARTH: How dare you!\nTEGAN: Shut up!\nTEGAN: Thank you. Now — I’m taking a little trip. Anyone want to come along for the ride?\nTEGAN: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 70\nTEGAN: SCENE 17. EXT. PEACE GARDEN\nTEGAN: MEMORIAL. LOWRI IS ALSO THERE.\nSUGRU: I found them when your guards apparently couldn’t.\nLOWRI: Doctor — what were you playing at?\nDOCTOR: Well, I could see I was causing trouble, so I thought —\nLEELA: (TO SUGRU) We were escaping. It had nothing to do with her.\nLOWRI: (TO LEELA) I was just starting to make some progress with him.\nSUGRU: No, you weren’t.\nLOWRI: Wasn’t I?\nSUGRU: Not in the slightest.\nLOWRI: I might have done if I’d had more time.\nSUGRU: You wouldn’t.\nDOCTOR: It’s a moot point now, isn’t it.\nLEELA: Very well, take us.\nDOCTOR: Yes — we surrender.\nSUGRU: You’1ll be killed when we return to Arimcea. Your fate is certain. You won’t escape our custody.\nDOCTOR: It never even occurred to us to try, did it?\nLEELA: There must be something else...\nLEELA: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 71\nDOCTOR: We can hope.\nDOCTOR: Tegan?\nSUGRU: Any attack on us will be considered an act of [war —]\nLEELA: Yes, yes, we know.\nTEGAN: Good, you’re all still here.\nSUGRU: We're leaving.\nTEGAN: Already? But we haven’t had the memorial ceremony yet!\nLEELA: (LOW) What is she doing, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: (LOW) No idea. I hope it’s something good.\nLOWRI: Er.. that is true. I mean, regardless of the issues you have with the Doctor and Leela, we still need to honour the dead, don’t we?\nSUGRU: (BEAT) Yes. But the Doctor and Leela should not be present — that would be an even greater insult.\nTEGAN: Of course. Lowri here can represent Gallifrey, and as for the neutral observers from other species — I’ve brought a few with me.\nCARTH: What is this place?\nTEGAN: It’s a peace garden, so please fellas, don’t start anything.\nTEGAN: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 72\nUSCAN: Who... who is that?\nSUGRU: Where... where did you find these people?\nCARTH: The voice...\nTEGAN: Found them on a little planet called Drella Nine. These guys have been fighting a hell of a war over you — you see, both of them think you created them in your image, and they’re not dealing very well with the whole difference of opinion thing.\nSUGRU: You should not have brought them...\nTEGAN: That’s not very nice, these are some of your biggest fans.\nUSCAN: He has the voice of the Arimcei.\nCARTH: The voice I hear in my head when I pray. It tells me my cause is righteous.\nUSCAN: It tells me my cause is righteous.\nCARTH: But... he looks like neither of us.\nUSCAN: Nothing like either of us.\nTEGAN: Well I never. But I thought you created them both in your image?\nDOCTOR: (LOW) Well played, Tegan.\nSUGRU: I.. take many forms.\nTEGAN: But you’ve been telling them both they’re right and the other lot are wrong. So... which is it?\nTEGAN: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 73\nSUGRU: Ah...\nUSCAN: The gods lied to us?\nCARTH: I must consult with the religious elders.\nUSCAN: We should all meet together. Cease hostilities [until —]\nSUGRU: No. No!\nTEGAN: Ooh, why don’t you want them to meet together?\nDOCTOR: Because the faith energy generated by their conflict is all that keeps the [Arimcei -]\nTEGAN: Yeah, I know, I’m trying to force him to tell more lies, give him enough rope to hang himself.\nDOCTOR: sorry.\nTEGAN: I think we’re done here. Back in the TARDIS and I’1l drop you all off home again.\nSUGRU: You can’t leave.\nTEGAN: I think we should, it’s all gone a bit awkward.\nSUGRU: No!\nSUGRU: HITS A FORCE FIELD.\nCARTH: He... tried to kill us!\nTEGAN: Isn’t it lucky I had the TARDIS force fields up?\nUSCAN: False. He’s a false god.\nUSCAN: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 74\nTEGAN: OK, everyone, show’s over.\nTEGAN: TARDIS.\nSUGRU: This cannot be. No! This is an act of aggression!\nSUGRU: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 75\nSUGRU: SCENE 18. INT. MILITARY TARDIS\nVORENA: (D) Well done, Tegan.\nTEGAN: Glad you showed me how to use the force fields. It’s a bit easier to be brave with those up.\nUSCAN: What are force fields?\nCARTH: Were we on another planet just now?\nTEGAN: Fellas, you’ve got so much to learn now his lot aren’t keeping you in the dark.\nTEGAN: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 76\nTEGAN: SCENE 19. EXT. PEACE GARDEN\nTEGAN: CONTINUES. SUGRU’S VOICE IS GETTING SMALLER, WEEDIER.\nLOWRI: This is nothing to do with us, by the way.\nLEELA: Obviously she stole that TARDIS and did that all by herself.\nDOCTOR: Clearly.\nSUGRU: Then you must punish her!\nLOWRI: Unfortunately, as an ambassador, I’m afraid she’s protected by diplomatic immunity.\nSUGRU: We’1ll crush her and her species!\nLEELA: Doctor — he is getting smaller and smaller.\nSUGRU: I hereby declare war on the planet Earth and its miserable inhabitants!\nDOCTOR: Tegan must have taken those people from a point in the past. She’s taken them back there, seeded doubt among them, and now the faith that sustains the Arimcei no longer exists. Like deflating a balloon.\nSUGRU: We shall return! We will find a way back...\nLOWRI: He’s gone.\nLEELA: Look!\nLEELA: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 77\nTEGAN: Hiya! — Where’s Sugru?\nLEELA: Gone.\nTEGAN: What, completely?\nLOWRI: His entire species. Without the faith to sustain them, the Arimcei are nothing.\nTEGAN: Oh. I thought I might just weaken them enough to make them back off, I didn’t mean to commit genocide.\nDOCTOR: Tegan, they had a choice a long time ago. They could have found another way to exist, but they chose to be parasites.\nTEGAN: If you say so.\nLOWRI: And I for one am so relieved we don’t have to be nice to them any more. All of Gallifrey thanks you for that, Tegan.\nTEGAN: No worries.\nLEELA: It was very clever. Wasn’t it, Doctor?\nTEGAN: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Yes, you did extremely well.\nTEGAN: You’re welcome. If you want to pop into the TARDIS, I’1ll give you a lift home.\nVOICES: FADE AS THEY WALK INSIDE.\nDOCTOR: All right, don’t get to enjoy it too much.\nTEGAN: Just because my TARDIS is bigger than yours.\nTEGAN: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 78\nDOCTOR: It’s not your TARDIS.\nTEGAN: You know like ambassadors have those stretch limos? This could be my Ambassadorial TARDTS...!\nTEGAN: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 79\nTEGAN: 3: History Repeating\nTEGAN: SCENE 1. INT. PRESIDENT’S OFFICE\nTEGAN: Where did that massive portrait of you come from?\nDOCTOR: Do you like it?\nTEGAN: It’s not bad. Did you get them to make that?\nDOCTOR: No no no. If they’d consulted me, I’d have got John Singer Sargeant to do it. He did a very good job last time, but that was two regenerations ago.\nTEGAN: Huh. Makes you look a bit... permanent. I thought you were only going to stay until they found someone else?\nDOCTOR: We need to lay the groundwork for them, make sure the public is primed.\nTEGAN: ‘Them’ ?\nDOCTOR: What?\nTEGAN: You said ‘them’. Like you don’t know who it is yet.\nDOCTOR: We haven’t pinned our candidate down, no. I’m discussing it with Vorena today before the Academies policy launch.\nTEGAN: See, you’re getting sucked into all this legislative stuff too.\nDOCTOR: It’s a golden opportunity, Tegan. Imagine you were suddenly made President of Earth.\nTEGAN: Ooh, imagine.\nTEGAN: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 80\nDOCTOR: There’s some business you’d like to get done, wouldn’t you?\nTEGAN: Oh yes. Close the gender pay gap, revise Aboriginal land rights, force my ex-boyfriend Scott to admit he had a thing with my cousin that summer —\nDOCTOR: Exactly. We’ve all got a list. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to cross some things off mine.\nDOCTOR: Ah, Vorena.\nVORENA: You wanted to talk?\nDOCTOR: Yes — sorry, Tegan.\nTEGAN: It’s fine. I’ll go for a wander.\nVORENA: Is she all right?\nDOCTOR: She’s just bored. I know the feeling only too well.\nDOCTOR: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 81\nDOCTOR: SCENE 2. INT. ACADEMY DORMITORY\nFEGAX: Computer — start recording.\nFEGAX: My name is Fegax, and I’m a student at the Academy. If you’re watching this message, my plan has succeeded. Maybe the authorities have managed to hush it up and banished me to the wastelands. But in one hour, the President is visiting the Academy and I’m going to use this.\nFEGAX: A temporal drill. See, eighteen thousand years ago this part of the Academy was all under water. I’m going to use this to open a wormhole from then to now and flood the place in a protest against how the older generation of Time Lords are clinging onto power, and we need to be washed away, just like I’m — hang on, I said ‘we’ need to be washed away, I meant ‘they’. Computer, stop recording.\nFEGAX: Let’s go again.\nFEGAX: My name is Fegax, and I’m...\nFEGAX: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 82\nFEGAX: SCENE 3. INT. CAPITOL LOUNGE\nINFINITY.

I’ve heard about you.\nTEGAN: Oh dear. Who from?\nSCANDRIUS: What you did to the Arimcei — it was amazing.\nTEGAN: I suppose.\nSCANDRIUS: Just, wow. That someone would be bold enough to think of something like that.\nTEGAN: Oh, you.\nSCANDRIUS: Look, I’d like to hear more about it — could I buy you a drink? There’s a little place I know...\nTEGAN: OK, you’ve twisted my arm.\nSCANDRIUS: Great. Come on!\nTEGAN: Easy, tiger.\nTEGAN: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 83\nTEGAN: SCENE 4. INT. PRESIDENT’S OFFICE\nVORENA: No, Doctor, we can’t have him.\nDOCTOR: What’s wrong with Chancellor Hanrith?\nVORENA: He’s got a reputation for anti-Arcalian bias.\nDOCTOR: Why?\nVORENA: Well, mostly because of his undeniable record of anti-Arcalian bias. And besides, he can’t smile without looking like he wants to eat you.\nDOCTOR: He could regenerate.\nVORENA: Might end up with something even worse. I think we’ll have to bring someone new through the High Council.\nDOCTOR: I’d never been on the Council before I was President.\nVORENA: You were a special case.\nDOCTOR: There is one member of the High Council we haven’t discussed yet.\nVORENA: Aha - No.\nDOCTOR: You’ve proved yourself more than able, and you have a good public profile —\nVORENA: Doctor, we both know I’m a polarising figure.\nDOCTOR: So am I.\nVORENA: Yes, but —\nVORENA: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 84\nDOCTOR: Some people really hate me.\nVORENA: But you are winning them over, exactly as I knew you would.\nVORENA: don’t have the charisma and I don’t want the job.\nDOCTOR: Let me know if you change your mind.\nVORENA: Good afternoon, Leela.\nLEELA: Doctor, Lowri sent me to tell you —\nDOCTOR: That it’s time for me to leave for the Academy, I know.\nLEELA: Lowri is there already. I am to accompany you by transmat.\nDOCTOR: She still doesn’t trust me with a TARDIS.\nVORENA: Can you blame her?\nDOCTOR: I suppose not.

LOWRI IS WAITING.\nLOWRI: There you are.\nLEELA: We are not late, Lowri.\nLOWRI: No, Leela, but we’ve had a security warning.\nDOCTOR: How exciting.\nLEELA: Yes.\nLOWRI: I think we should get this over with as quickly as possible, before anything happens.\nDOCTOR: Oh yes, we don’t want anything to happen. That would be awful.\nLOWRI: Follow me.\nSTUDENTS HAS GATHERED: THEY APPLAUD THE DOCTOR AS HE ENTERS.\nDOCTOR: (CALLS) Hello, yes, thank you for coming.\nLOWRI: First there’s a reception, hosted by an Architecture professor named Kasnegar —\nDOCTOR: (LAUGHS) You’re joking!\nLEELA: Something is funny?\nDOCTOR: Kasnegar never forgave me for rewiring the food machine on the fourth floor so that, instead of soup, it dispensed —\nDOCTOR: BUILDING. HE SOUNDS VERY SELF-SATISFIED.\nDOCTOR: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 87\nFEGAX: Just a moment, Lord President.\nDOCTOR: I didn’t think we were doing autographs until the end.\nFEGAX: My name is Fegax and I am here to protest.\nLOWRI: In that case, you should have lodged an application to do so —\nFEGAX: I don’t need an application from you High Council bureaucrats. I’ve got my temporal drill.\nEARLIER: IT’S A BIT LIKE A KEYTAR.\nLEELA: He has a weapon! Stand aside, I [will —]\nDOCTOR: No no, let’s listen to what he has [to —]\nFEGAX: No! You will listen to what I have to say!\nDOCTOR: That’s what I was saying.\nFEGAX: Good! I am here to protest against Time Lords continuing to occupy senior positions over successive regenerations.\nLOWRI: Not this again.\nFEGAX: This is a major issue for our generation. How can we aspire to the top jobs?\nDOCTOR: That’s a valid criticism, and in fact I’m considering the\nDOCTOR: introduction of maximum terms [for —]\nFEGAX: Yeah, you can talk — but I’m taking action!\nFEGAX: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 88\nLEELA: What are you doing?\nFEGAX: You will now see the power of my temporal drill.\nLOWRI: Guards — stop him!\nFEGAX: It’s too late!\nFEGAX: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 89\nFEGAX: SCENE 7.

STOLEN TARDIS\nTEGAN: Scandrius, why didn’t you tell me this was your TARDIS?\nSCANDRIUS: Well... it’s not actually mine.\nTEGAN: It’s stolen?\nSCANDRIUS: I saw her in a landing bay, and she just called out to me. She wanted to be stolen.\nTEGAN: Maybe she did, but I certainly didn’t!\nSCANDRIUS: I could see it in your eyes you were as bored back on Gallifrey as I was. And the Doctor wasn’t going to take you anywhere —\nTEGAN: Wait — how do you know about that?\nSCANDRIUS: A lot of gossip goes on around the Capitol. Probably because we’re all so bored.\nTEGAN: OK, I am bored, but that’s no excuse — I thought we were just going for a drink.\nSCANDRIUS: We are. I know a little place near Proxima Centauri. If you’re still interested.\nTEGAN: All right.\nSCANDRIUS: Great. Sorry, it was supposed to be a big gesture, you know.\nTEGAN: It comes off more like a kidnapping.\nSCANDRIUS: Sorry, yes, I see that now.\nSCANDRIUS: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 90\nSCANDRIUS: SCENE 8.

Can I disarm him now, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I suppose so.\nLEELA: Good.\nFEGAX: No. Keep away — I’m warning you —\nFEGAX: TO THE GROUND.\nFEGAX: (WINDED) Police brutality!\nLEELA: I will take that.\nFEGAX: (WINDED) Give my temporal drill back — you can’t possibly\nFEGAX: understand it.\nLEELA: No. That is why I am giving it to the Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Thank you.\nLOWRI: Guards!\nLOWRI: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 91\nDOCTOR: IS EXAMINING THE MACHINE, AND SPEAKS IN AN\nOFFHAND: WAY.\nLOWRI: Arrest this student, and charge him [with —]\nDOCTOR: Oh, I hardly think that’s necessary.\nLOWRI: It is necessary.\nDOCTOR: Just confine him to his dormitory until my visit is done.\nFEGAX: I don’t need any favours from you.\nLOWRI: (SIGHS) Do as the Lord President says.

I’ve never travelled so far before — and I always had a supervisor with me. But instead I’m out here with a real, living, breathing alien!\nTEGAN: That’s me.\nSCANDRIUS: Who knows what we’1ll find out there?\nTEGAN: I thought you said we were going for a drink?\nSCANDRIUS: It might start out like that. But then — perhaps we’1ll find injustices to be righted.

Yes, he never could resist bringing strange creatures home with him.\nDOCTOR: How’s the trans-dimensional architecture department?\nKASNEGAR: I haven’t been here much, I’m leading the team designing the new Capitol.\nDOCTOR: Oh, well the proposals look splendid. But I’d expected you to be head of department by now.\nKASNEGAR: No, Alafar still hasn’t retired.\nDOCTOR: Aha, you see under my proposals you’1ll be able to move sideways to a position at another Academy.\nKASNEGAR: I’m too settled here to move.\nDOCTOR: Maybe old Alafar will. Or who knows, maybe he’1ll regenerate and he'll suddenly be terrible at trans-dimensional architecture and he’1l have to retire.\nDOCTOR: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 96\nKASNEGAR: Actually that has already happened.\nDOCTOR: Oh.\nKASNEGAR: Only he didn’t retire.\nDOCTOR: (CHANGING SUBJECT) I’d like to see my old room.\nLOWRI: It would make a good photo opportunity.\nKASNEGAR: If we must.

Well — they smell like this. And the texture of this stuff the TARDIS is sitting on...\nSCANDRIUS: (OFF) Yes — viscous, slippery. Like —\nTEGAN: Toothpaste.\nSCANDRIUS: (OFF) What?\nSCANDRIUS: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 98\nTEGAN: I think this whole planet is made of toothpaste.\nSCANDRIUS: (OFF) What is ‘toothpaste’ ?\nTEGAN: For cleaning your teeth. Why on earth would a planet be made of toothpaste?\nSCANDRIUS: (OFF) Aha! One of the many mysteries of the cosmos. Together we shall discover the truth behind it, no matter how unpalatable or disturbing it may [be —]\nTEGAN: We could... or I could lower a rope so you can climb back up and we could go somewhere you can actually walk around.\nSCANDRIUS: (OFF) Yes, that too.

But he is a terrible gossip.\nKASNEGAR: You nearly cost me a regeneration! Why did you use a drinks machine to synthesise mercury?\nDOCTOR: Just a little experiment I was working on. The lab was shut so I had to do it in my room.\nKASNEGAR: Speaking of which, here is your old room.\nLEELA: Oh!\nDOCTOR: Gosh.\nDOCTOR: Look at that. And it’s still got my old poster of Marcella\nDOCTOR: Retaxus.\nLEELA: Who’s she?\nLEELA: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 100\nDOCTOR: She was a reverse fusion engineer when I was at school — rather good singer, too. The place hasn’t changed a bit.\nKASNEGAR: No, of course it hasn’t.\nDOCTOR: (BEAT) Oh of course. I was fiddling around with time field distortions one night and accidentally set the entire room in permanent stasis.\nLEELA: Oh dear.\nKASNEGAR: Still nobody can work out how you did it.\nDOCTOR: I wish I knew.

DOCTOR'S SPEECH\nCONTINUES: UNDERNEATH.\nDOCTOR: (BACKGROUND) I remember my time at the Academy with fondness and pride, but also feelings of resentment and despair. I think that’s the nature of the institutions that raise us, and I’m suspicious of anyone who says otherwise. Of course, I never tried to destroy it entirely, but a very good friend of mine did, and if he was here today... well, he’d tell me I wasn’t going far enough. I seem to have drifted off the point, but what I’m saying is, we shouldn’t let nostalgia cloud our need to embrace change. Thank you.\nLOWRI: Oh that’s me. Sorry.\nLEELA: Who is it?\nLOWRI: This is Castellan Lowri.\nVORENA: (D) This is Vorena. The Doctor is still there, isn’t he?\nLOWRI: Of course, why?\nVORENA: (D) A TARDIS has been stolen.\nLOWRI: Well it’s not him, he’s here. Unless he travelled back in time and —\nVORENA: (D) Look, I need help with this urgently, transmat back here now.\nVORENA: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 104\nLOWRI: All right, I'll [just —]\nLOWRI: Right, yes, she’s already gone.\nLOWRI: APPLAUDS.\nLOWRI: Tell the Doctor I had to go back to the Capitol.\nLEELA: Because of the stolen TARDIS?\nLOWRI: Don’t tell him there’s a stolen TARDIS. I’1l see you later.\nLEELA: Understood.\nDOCTOR: I thought that went rather well. Where’s Lowri?\nLEELA: She went back to the Capitol to deal with a stolen TARDIS.\nDOCTOR: How interesting. Well, since she’s not here, let’s have a look at that device you took from that student, shall we?\nDOCTOR: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 105\nDOCTOR: SCENE 15. INT.

I want to go back.\nSCANDRIUS: Of course, just as soon as I set the, er... helmic regulator and stabilise the time rotor, and... stuff.\nTEGAN: You don’t know what you’re doing, do you?\nSCANDRIUS: I do, I just —\nTEGAN: Don’t.\nSCANDRIUS: Not as such, no. Something seems to be preventing us from entering the correct segment of time. In fact.. we seem to be moving further away [from —]\nTEGAN: Is that clock supposed to do that?\nSCANDRIUS: Do what?\nTEGAN: It’s melting.\nSCANDRIUS: Right.

Lower order Prydonian.. bit of a loner... he seems to fit the profile, Lowri.\nLOWRI: He would’ve had access to TARDIS keys... and he was seen with Tegan earlier today, and we can’t locate either of them now.\nVORENA: He’s taken the Doctor’s human?\nLOWRI: Or she went with him willingly. (LOW) Vorena, we can’t let the Doctor get involved in this.\nVORENA: (LOW) Why not?\nLOWRI: (LOW) His concern for his human isn’t playing well with the public.\nVORENA: We need to think of something. They’re travelling too fast — we can’t materialise around them. If only we still had the Timescoop —\nLOWRI: Don’t ask me to reactivate the Timescoop.\nVORENA: I’m not, but.. we may have to let them go.\nVORENA: Oh.\nVORENA: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 108\nLOWRI: What does that mean?\nVORENA: Paradox alarm.

From the staff parking bay at the Academy. Nice sporty little number. You know, I think it might belong to Kasnegar?

But Doctor, we’ve already tried materialising around the other [TARDIS —]\nDOCTOR: (D) I’m not going to do that.\nLOWRI: So what are you going to do?\nDOCTOR: (D) Crash into them, of course.\nLOWRI: What?\nDOCTOR: (D) Talk to you in a minute, if this works.\nDOCTOR: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 112\nDOCTOR: SCENE 20.

It only sounds —\nTEGAN: I know what the cloister bell is, you idiot!\nTEGAN: COMING IN AND OUT.\nSCANDRIUS: Someone’s hailing us on the scanner.\nDOCTOR: (D) Hello!\nTEGAN: Doctor!\nSCANDRIUS: Oh.\nDOCTOR: (D) Tegan, what are you doing there?\nTEGAN: Look, I'll explain later, right now we’re in a bit of trouble\nDOCTOR: (D) I know. But don’t worry, I’ve extrapolated your course and the good news is you’re locked into a quite narrow time path.\nTEGAN: Best news ever.\nDOCTOR: (D) That means it should be easy for me to materialise in your path, which I’m doing... now.\nSCANDRIUS: In our path?\nSCANDRIUS: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 113\nDOCTOR: (D) That’s right, so you might want to find something to hang onto. Some of these models are fitted with seat belts I think. Impact in five.. four...\nTEGAN: Oh my giddy aunt—\nDOCTOR: (D) Three... two...\nSCANDRIUS: Hold on!\nDOCTOR: (D) One —\nDOCTOR: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 114\nDOCTOR: SCENE 21. INT. LANDING BAY\nLOWRI: (BEAT) It’s stopped.\nVORENA: Lowri, he’s done it.\nLOWRI: But I thought he was only knocking their TARDIS off course, Vorena. Did he... destroy it?\nVORENA: He may have had to.\nVORENA: (CALLS) Clear the area! The Lord President is —\nVORENA: Two TARDISes.\nLOWRI: He saved them!\nDOCTOR: Did it work? (BEAT) Ah! Yes.\nTEGAN: Oh thank heavens. We’re back!\nSCANDRIUS: (SIGH) Yes, so we are.\nLOWRI: Doctor, this TARDIS you ‘borrowed’...\nDOCTOR: Mm? Oh yes, sorry about that.\nLOWRI: I don’t think it’s me you should apologise to.\nLOWRI: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 115\nDOCTOR: I needed to slow their TARDIS down, so I let this TARDIS absorb most of the impact.\nVORENA: You have absolutely wrecked that.\nDOCTOR: Nothing a couple of weeks of block transfer restoration won’t fix. In the big scheme of [things —]\nLOWRI: I’1l call Kasnegar and let him know.\nVORENA: So, when the other TARDIS was slowed down enough —\nDOCTOR: I managed to bring it within the dimensional field of this one. Like a tow truck. Good feature, that.\nTEGAN: Thank you. (TO SCANDRIUS) Say ‘thank you’.\nSCANDRIUS: (RELUCTANTLY) Thank you.\nVORENA: You are in very serious trouble, Scandrius. In fact, I should check the Matrix for any timeline damage. Excuse me.\nSCANDRIUS: Doctor. I only did exactly what you did, all those years ago.\nDOCTOR: I suppose you did.\nSCANDRIUS: You had the strength of character to say you were going to go out there, and explore, and do [good —]}]\nTEGAN: Leela!\nLEELA: Tegan! I am very glad you survived.\nLEELA: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 116\nTEGAN: Yeah, well me too.\nDOCTOR: Did you give that student his temporal drill back?\nLEELA: Yes.\nSCANDRIUS: Excuse me, I was trying to confront you with the reality of what you’ve become.\nDOCTOR: Sorry, yes, So you were.\nSCANDRIUS: You were a hero to me — to us all. And now look at you. Sitting at the top of the establishment. You wouldn’t know an act of rebellion if it punched you in [the —]\nLOWRI: (OFF) Doctor!\nSCANDRIUS: I was nearly finished!\nDOCTOR: Sorry, Lowri — just a moment. (TO SCANDRIUS) Please, do finish.\nSCANDRIUS: (SLIGHTLY DEFLATED) Teeth.\nDOCTOR: Right. (TO LOWRI) Yes, Lowri?\nLOWRI: I’ve just put in a call to the Academy, and the entire building is flooded.\nSCANDRIUS: Flooded?\nLEELA: How unexpected.\nLOWRI: Doctor, did you fix that temporal drill you took off that student?\nLOWRI: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 117\nDOCTOR: I expect he did it himself, it was very straightforward. Probably, I mean I wouldn’t know.\nSCANDRIUS: But how —\nDOCTOR: Lovely to meet you, sorry you’re disappointed that I’ve sold out to the establishment and whatnot, anyway, work to do. Come on, Tegan, Leela.\nLEELA: This was fun.\nSCANDRIUS: Tegan? Can I see you again?\nTEGAN: (OFF) I don’t think so.\nTEGAN: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 118\nTEGAN: SCENE 22. INT. VORENA’S OFFICE\nTEGAN: IS WAITING FOR HER.\nARCANTIS: Well that was a risk that didn’t pay off — wasn’t it, Vorena?\nVORENA: There was no harm done, Arcantis.\nARCANTIS: There could have been. I told you Scandrius was incompetent.\nVORENA: Exactly, I assumed they’d just get lost in time and space and we'd never see them again. It seemed the easiest way to get rid of Tegan.\nARCANTIS: There’s no way this can be traced back to you? Or me, for that matter? Someone of my public profile can’t be associated [with\nARCANTIS: =a\nVORENA: No, he’ll never make the connection. And the access privileges we'll give you are worth a little risk, surely?\nARCANTIS: What now?\nVORENA: We proceed. I think this would be a good time to run your exposé on what happened with the Arimcei. Play down Tegan’s role, we don’t want her to be the focus.\nARCANTIS: As long as you’re ready.\nVORENA: It would’ve been easier without Tegan around... but she can’t stop us. Ultimately, the Doctor will see things our way.\nVORENA: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 119\nVORENA: 4: Architect of Destruction\nVORENA: SCENE 1. INT. PRESIDENT’S CHAMBERS\nTEGAN: You mean it’s finished?\nLEELA: Yes. A little behind schedule, [but —]\nTEGAN: But I walked past the building site yesterday and there was nothing there. I mean, literally just a blank space.\nLEELA: They have a special way of building things here, Tegan.\nDOCTOR: (OFF) Block transfer computation, Leela.\nLEELA: Yes, what the Doctor said.\nTEGAN: That rings a bell — they had that on Logopolis, right?\nDOCTOR: (OFF) That’s the chap. Enables you to create structures out of pure mathematics. Bit more elegant than putting up scaffolding and lugging bricks around.\nLEELA: I don’t understand how it works.\nDOCTOR: (OFF) Don’t worry — almost nobody does. But it means you can perfect a virtual model and the transfer into reality is practically instantaneous.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I know what you’re laughing at.\nDOCTOR: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 120\nTEGAN: You look very dignified.\nDOCTOR: No I don’t.\nLEELA: What is that around your neck?\nDOCTOR: The Sash of Rassilon. I also have to hold the Staff of Rassilon, not to be confused with the Rod of Rassilon, the Coronet of Rassilon, the Thimble of Rassilon -\nTEGAN: And is that the Belt of Rassilon?\nDOCTOR: No, this is the Belt of Omega. Between them they discovered the power that remains the cornerstone of Time Lord society, but they had no sense of style.\nTEGAN: Maybe Omega tried to steal your body because he was jealous.\nLEELA: You have to wear all these things?\nDOCTOR: Well, the opening of a new Capitol building is quite a big deal.\nTEGAN: What are they going to do with the old Capitol building?\nDOCTOR: Oh, I don’t know. Turn it into flats and a hotel probably. Always thought it was quite ugly. It was never meant to be permanent.\nLEELA: The previous one was the focus of an invasion by beings who called themselves Dominators.\nTEGAN: Dominators? Seriously?\nDOCTOR: There was never any serious risk of us being conquered, but they flooded the Capitol with Quarks.\nLEELA: K9 and I destroyed thirty-nine of them between us.\nLEELA: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 121\nDOCTOR: But one of them had a bomb in it. Did quite a bit of damage. Anyway, the High Council put up the temporary one while they argued endlessly about what the new one would be.\nTEGAN: And you've finally got them to agree?\nDOCTOR: Yes. You see, I am getting things done. Are you two coming?\nTEGAN: Only if I don’t have to wear Rassilon’s hand-me-downs.\nDOCTOR: Don’t worry, that’s my job.\nDOCTOR: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 122\nDOCTOR: SCENE 2. INT. SITE OFFICE\nDOCTOR: BUSTLES IN TO MEET KASNEGAR.\nLOWRI: Sorry about that, Kasnegar, all very hectic today.\nKASNEGAR: Quite all right, Castellan.\nLOWRI: Call me Lowri. Now, obviously we can’t get round all the new Capitol building today —\nKASNEGAR: No no, it would take seventy-three days to traverse every part of the Capitol.\nLOWRI: Right.\nKASNEGAR: Depending on how fast you walk.\nLOWRI: Obviously. So what we’ve planned is this — a route that takes us through the Hall of Rassilon, on to the Panopticon, through the Council Chamber then back via the Presidential offices.\nKASNEGAR: Could we see the High Courtroom as well?\nLOWRI: Why?\nKASNEGAR: I’m rather proud of it.\nLOWRI: All right — we’ll see if there’s time, I’m [sure —]\nVORENA: Stop what you’re doing.\nLOWRI: I was just talking [to —]\nVORENA: There’s a labour dispute among the Sheboogans.\nVORENA: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 123\nKASNEGAR: Again?\nVORENA: Who are you?\nLOWRI: This is Kasnegar, the architect behind our new Capitol building.\nVORENA: Congratulations, it’s a triumph.\nKASNEGAR: Thank you. We really wanted to [reflect —]\nVORENA: (TO LOWRI) You’re needed immediately to resolve this Sheboogan business.\nLOWRI: Is it really as urgent as [all —]\nVORENA: It won’t look good if you’re going on a jolly while the Sheboogans are rioting, will it?\nLOWRI: They’re rioting?\nVORENA: Not yet, but they might unless someone does something.\nLOWRI: Who'll go on the tour instead?\nVORENA: I will. Could be amusing.\nLOWRI: Well — if I’m back in time for the ceremonial dinner, save me a seat.\nKASNEGAR: Chancellor, I’m deeply honoured to present the [new —]\nVORENA: Don’t lay it on too thick, Kasnegar.\nKASNEGAR: Yes — sorry.\nKASNEGAR: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 124\nVORENA: Come on, the President’s arriving.\nVORENA: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 125\nVORENA: SCENE 3. EXT. CAPITOL\nTEGAN: Oh hey. So this is it?\nLEELA: It is very... red.\nDOCTOR: It is, isn’t it?\nTEGAN: It totally clashes with the sky.\nVORENA: I’m afraid it’s too late to change it.\nDOCTOR: Ah, Vorena. And Kasnegar! Good to see you again, hope they’ve managed to get the building to dry out.\nKASNEGAR: My office is still out of bounds.\nDOCTOR: Oh dear. Students these days, eh?\nKASNEGAR: Indeed.\nDOCTOR: It didn’t look quite this red on the blueprint.\nLEELA: Probably because it was blue.\nTEGAN: Maybe you could change the colour of the sky instead?\nDOCTOR: Hmm.\nLEELA: I think she was joking.\nDOCTOR: What do you think, Vorena?\nDOCTOR: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL)\nVORENA: I think we should get on with the tour.\nDOCTOR: Yes. I’m sure we’ll get used to the red. Lead on!\nKASNEGAR: (CLEARS THROAT) Open!\nKASNEGAR: This way, please.\nKASNEGAR: Page\nKASNEGAR: 126\nKASNEGAR: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 127\nKASNEGAR: SCENE 4. INT. HALL OF RASSILON\nKASNEGAR: THROUGH AN IMPRESSIVE HALL. SHE SOUNDS NERVOUS.\nKASNEGAR: So, er, we decided that it would simplify everything if the main transmat terminal for visitors was here —\nDOCTOR: In the same place as the ground entrance, yes.\nTEGAN: All the faces on the statues keep changing.\nVORENA: Fluid sculpture. Each of these is a notable Time Lord, depicted in all their regenerations. Rassilon, Omega, Apeiron, Pandak, Pandak the fourth, Eutenoyar, Pandak the eleventh —\nLEELA: Doctor — there’s you!\nDOCTOR: Oh, now you didn’t tell me you were going to do that.\nKASNEGAR: She wanted it to be a surprise, Lord President.\nDOCTOR: You, Vorena?\nVORENA: Naturally, we can update it to add your subsequent incarnations.\nDOCTOR: Unless I’m disgraced and it’s torn down following a campaign of public outrage.\nVORENA: I don’t think that’s likely to happen.\nDOCTOR: I’m taking nothing for granted. Shall we move on? I’m worried it might fall on me, being crushed by an enormous statue of yourself would be a very silly way to die.\nKASNEGAR: It won’t collapse, it’s bonded to the wall at a [molecular —]\nKASNEGAR: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 128\nDOCTOR: (OFF) I’m sure it is, yes.\nDOCTOR: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 129\nDOCTOR: SCENE 5. INT. PANOPTICON\nLEELA: Where are we now?\nVORENA: This is the new Panopticon, isn’t it?\nKASNEGAR: Yes — and in fact, we modified the design to accommodate your... exciting new plans to create more Time Lords.\nDOCTOR: The acoustics are very good.\nKASNEGAR: And we have six entranceways leading off, bearing chapter seals\nTEGAN: Did you just see that?\nDOCTOR: See what?\nTEGAN: I don’t know... You know when you’d see in a film that they’d zoom in and move the camera at the same time so it’d sort of —\nDOCTOR: Ah yes. I gave Alfred Hitchcock the idea for that, you know.\nTEGAN: No you didn’t.\nDOCTOR: I might have done.\nVORENA: (OFF) We’re a bit behind schedule — we need to be at the\nVORENA: President’s office in twenty minutes, so if you don’t mind —\nDOCTOR: Come on, Tegan.\nTEGAN: Yeah — in a minute.\nTEGAN: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 130\nTEGAN: SCENE 6. EXT. CAPITOL\nTEGAN: COMMENTATING, ALONG WITH A SENIOR TIME LORD CALLED KESNELL.\nARCANTIS: A good crowd gathering now at the doorway to the new Capitol building, which really is looking splendid. The President is still touring the complex, he should be out in less than an hour — so while we’re waiting we’ll bring you the latest on the Sheboogan crisis. Chancellor Kesnell is with me now — can you enlighten us on the Sheboogan situation?\nKESNELL: Yes, negotiations have broken down.\nARCANTIS: A number of Gallifreyan citizens will be asking how this can be allowed to happen.\nKESNELL: As well they might. I and many others have repeatedly warned the Castellan that this situation was inevitable, but no action has been taken because she’s been running around after the President.\nARCANTIS: And you view this as a problem?\nKESNELL: The Castellan has gone a long way beyond her remit since the President was appointed, and frankly it seems she is determined to interfere in Presidential business.\nARCANTIS: I see.\nKESNELL: It’s no secret she resisted the appointment of the Doctor and fundamentally disagrees with his methods.\nARCANTIS: Is there a general lack of confidence in the Castellan’s abilities?\nKESNELL: You understand that I can’t speak for others.\nARCANTIS: Of course.\nARCANTIS: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 131\nKESNELL: But the people who disagree with me on this are idiots.\nARCANTIS: Fascinating — stay with us, when the tour’s over we’ll bring you our first exclusive interview with the President — I’m sure\nARCANTIS: it’ll be the first of many.\nARCANTIS: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 132\nARCANTIS: SCENE 7. INT. COURTROOM\nKASNEGAR: Ah yes — and this is the courtroom.\nDOCTOR: This is very nice. If my last trial had taken place here I think it would’ve been a more pleasant experience all round.\nVORENA: Rather a good speech you made at that trial, I thought.\nDOCTOR: I didn’t realise you’d seen it.\nLEELA: Where’s Tegan?\nDOCTOR: Oh, she’s terrible for wandering off.\nVORENA: Kasnegar — could you go and get her? You know your way round better than any of us.\nKASNEGAR: I suppose —\nVORENA: Come on, quick quick.\nKASNEGAR: All right, all right. (HURRIES AWAY)\nDOCTOR: I do like it.\nVORENA: The courtroom?\nDOCTOR: The whole building. It’s all very... timeless, ironically. Or do I mean appropriately?\nLEELA: Don’t you find the layout doesn’t always seem to make sense?\nVORENA: I’m sure it’1ll make sense to you once you see it up and running.\nVORENA: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 133\nVORENA: SCENE 8. INT. PANOPTICON\nKASNEGAR: Tegan..? There you are.\nTEGAN: All of the corridors in here are the same, when I look down them my eyes just go —\nKASNEGAR: We need to catch up with the others.\nTEGAN: But look —\nKASNEGAR: We’re getting left behind.\nTEGAN: All right —\nTEGAN: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 134\nTEGAN: SCENE 9. INT. COURTROOM\nDOCTOR: You are one of the most evil and corrupt beings our Time Lord race has ever produced. Your crimes are without number and your villainy without end. And so.. I am stopping your pocket money for the next five hundred years.\nVORENA: You do realise there are cameras following you everywhere on this visit.\nLEELA: Of course he realises that, Vorena. That is why he does it.\nVORENA: This footage will be released to the media, it would be helpful if we didn’t have to edit around your clowning.\nDOCTOR: Sorry, am I compromising my Presidential gravity again?\nVORENA: Slightly.\nDOCTOR: The wearer of the Thimble of Rassilon must conduct himself with\nDOCTOR: dignity at all times.\nVORENA: Doctor, it makes everyone’s job harder when you —\nDOCTOR: Where on earth is Tegan?\nLEELA: (CALLS) Tegan?\nVORENA: Perhaps we should continue —\nDOCTOR: Without the architect? That doesn’t seem fair, the whole point of this is so she can show us all the clever things she’s done\nDOCTOR: with —\nDOCTOR: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 135\nDOCTOR: The door.\nLEELA: What?\nDOCTOR: Does anyone know what’s happened to the door?\nDOCTOR: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 136\nDOCTOR: SCENE 10. INT. CORRIDOR\nDOCTOR: CORRIDOR.\nTEGAN: Is this the right way?\nKASNEGAR: Of course it’s the right way. You’re talking to the man who designed this place — we simply turn left down here and —\nKASNEGAR: Ow.\nTEGAN: OK, great.\nKASNEGAR: This — this isn’t supposed to be a wall. It should lead directly to [the —]\nTEGAN: Well it doesn’t, does it?\nKASNEGAR: What’s going on?\nTEGAN: Is it stable, this place?\nKASNEGAR: What do you mean?\nTEGAN: I dunno, however your Block Transfer Computation thing works — did you forget to carry the one or something?\nKASNEGAR: It’s a little more complicated than that.\nTEGAN: OK, great — you know more about it than me, you work [it —]\nTEGAN: A BLACKBOARD. THE ARCHITECTURE IS SHIFTING BENEATH THEIR FEET. NOT TOO LOUD YET BUT WILL GET LOUDER.\nTEGAN: What was that?\nTEGAN: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 137\nKASNEGAR: It can’t be.\nTEGAN: Can’t be what?\nKASNEGAR: Nothing.\nKASNEGAR: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 138\nKASNEGAR: SCENE 11. INT. COURTROOM\nLEELA: Doctor...\nDOCTOR: Yes, I don’t like the sound of that either.\nLEELA: Are you sure this building is safe?\nVORENA: We drone-tested it thoroughly this morning.\nDOCTOR: But has anyone actually walked through it before?\nVORENA: Well... no, that’s the point. You get to be the first!\nLEELA: We are getting out of here.\nDOCTOR: Yes. (BEAT) How? The door’s gone.\nVORENA: Up to the public gallery — there’s another door there.\nVORENA: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 139\nVORENA: SCENE 12. INT. CORRIDOR\nTEGAN: Rabbits!\nKASNEGAR: What did you say?\nTEGAN: Kasnegar — this is meant to lead to that hall with all the statues in it. Where are we now?\nKASNEGAR: This is the banqueting hall. You see, the tables and chairs are all kinetic and can be rearranged into new formations at the touch of [a —]\nTEGAN: OK, great, but we need to — wait.\nKASNEGAR: What?\nTEGAN: There’s windows in the ceiling.\nKASNEGAR: Yes, in fact they can be opened to the sky to form —\nTEGAN: Is there a ladder or whatever?\nKASNEGAR: No, it’s all automated.\nKASNEGAR: THROUGH THE BUILDING.\nTEGAN: OK — we need to get out of here. You were about to say you could move the tables and chairs at the touch of a button, yeah?\nKASNEGAR: Well, it’s not a button, [it’s —]\nTEGAN: But you can make them move?\nKASNEGAR: Yes, the controls are here.\nKASNEGAR: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 140\nTEGAN: Can you pile them all up on each other high enough to reach the ceiling?\nKASNEGAR: (BEAT) Oh no.\nTEGAN: Oh no you can’t, or oh no you don’t want to?\nKASNEGAR: I couldn’t climb as high as that — I’m not good with -\nTEGAN: Look, I can tell you know a lot more about this than you’re letting on.\nKASNEGAR: No, I — I’m telling you — (STOPS LYING) This shouldn’t be happening — not yet...\nTEGAN: Right — first, you’re getting me out of here. Then you explain what’s going on and how we get everyone else out too!\nTEGAN: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 141\nTEGAN: SCENE 13. INT. CORRIDOR\nTEGAN: THE BUILDING SHIFTS.\nVORENA: This way.\nLEELA: Where are we?\nDOCTOR: Your sense of direction is usually infallible.\nLEELA: I know.\nDOCTOR: There’s only one sensible conclusion. The entire Capitol is shifting around us. This can’t just be a flaw in the block transfer — it’s too big for that...\nVORENA: Through here.\nLEELA: Is it the way out?\nVORENA: I think so.\nVORENA: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 142\nVORENA: SCENE 14. EXT. CAPITOL\nARCANTIS: We continue to await an official explanation regarding the noises emanating from the new Capitol complex —\nKESNELL: This is the Castellan’s area, Arcantis. She should be all over this.\nARCANTIS: We reiterate, do not adjust your mediascreen —\nKESNELL: Matters of infrastructure are clearly the domain of the — of — ugh I think I’m going to be sick, that noise cuts straight through [you —]\nARCANTIS: Apologies for interrupting you, Chancellor Kesnell, but I’m just hearing two people are apparently emerging from the Capitol at this very moment.. via the skylight in the banqueting hall. A skimmer has been dispatched to pick them up...\nKESNELL: It moved!\nARCANTIS: Sorry, Chancellor?\nKESNELL: Up there — the spire. It just moved!\nARCANTIS: Fascinating developments here at the opening of the new Capitol.\nARCANTIS: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 143\nARCANTIS: SCENE 15. INT. CONTROL ROOM\nARCANTIS: ENTERS, FOLLOWED BY DOCTOR AND LEELA.\nLEELA: Where are we now?\nVORENA: President’s quarters.\nLEELA: But it looks like —\nDOCTOR: The control room of a TARDIS.\nLEELA: Yes.\nDOCTOR: A little larger, but unmistakable. Vorena, I don’t remember this being in the plans.\nLEELA: Doctor, she knows something.\nDOCTOR: I think so too.\nLEELA: Talk or I will cut out your —\nVORENA: Wait, Leela. I’m quite happy to tell you everything.\nVORENA: AND IT COMES TO LIFE WITH A SOFT, LOW GROAN.\nDOCTOR: This is a TARDIS.\nVORENA: Much more than a TARDIS.\nDOCTOR: But it is a TARDIS.\nLEELA: What is?\nLEELA: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL)\nDOCTOR: The entire Capitol.\nLEELA: The Capitol is a TARDIS?\nVORENA: The largest TARDIS ever built.\nLEELA: Do you hear that? That groaning?\nDOCTOR: Yes. I think it’s talking to us.\nLEELA: What is it saying?\nDOCTOR: It’s just been born. It’s trying to understand\nDOCTOR: Page 144\nDOCTOR: what it is.\nDOCTOR: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 145\nDOCTOR: SCENE 16. INT. SITE OFFICE\nDOCTOR: KASNEGAR. A LOT OF HUBBUB, PEOPLE WONDERING WHAT’S\nGOING: ON.\nLOWRI: One side, please — out of the way! Guard — close the door and keep everyone out.\nTEGAN: Right, then, Kasnegar — tell us what’s going on.\nKASNEGAR: I won’t speak to the Castellan without legal representation.\nLOWRI: Oh yes you will — the new Capitol you designed for us is moving around out there!\nKASNEGAR: It wasn’t just me, it was a team effort.\nTEGAN: And the Doctor, and Leela and Vorena are inside!\nKASNEGAR: None of this was my idea! It.. was part of the brief.\nLOWRI: I prepared that brief.\nKASNEGAR: After you signed it off there were some... tweaks.\nTEGAN: Who tweaked it?\nKASNEGAR: It was a big commission — the kind of thing you dream of! I\nKASNEGAR: could never have said no —\nTEGAN: Who? Not the Doctor?\nKASNEGAR: No. Vorena.\nKASNEGAR: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 146\nLOWRI: (CROSSING TO DOOR) What’s going on out there...?\nTEGAN: Castellan..

CONTROL ROOM\nNOISES: OUTSIDE.\nDOCTOR: Why, Vorena?\nVORENA: You’ve been saying since you got here that you miss your TARDIS. I thought I’d get you a new one.\nLEELA: Why is it moving?\nVORENA: It was supposed to stay dormant at first, but this sort of intelligence is always a little unpredictable.\nDOCTOR: It’s responding to my presence.\nVORENA: You want to get away from here, don’t you? Maybe it does too.\nLEELA: Doctor, look — the scanner!\nDOCTOR: The whole structure is rising up.\nVORENA: This is a masterpiece of architecture and engineering. It moves between the form of a citadel and a humanoid machine.\nLEELA: A giant robot?\nVORENA: If you like.\nDOCTOR: Why?\nVORENA: Because we need a new politics.\nDOCTOR: A new politics... with a giant time-travelling robot?\nVORENA: We all know you left because you were frustrated we didn’t use our power —\nVORENA: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 148\nDOCTOR: That was one of the [reasons —]\nVORENA: I’m giving you the power. You can take the Capitol through all of time and space, making your interventions with the full force of the Time Lords behind you.\nDOCTOR: It’s a very thoughtful gift, but —\nVORENA: This is what you were born to do — I have the backing of enough senior Time Lords, people who’ve admired you for a long time but didn’t feel able to say so openly.\nDOCTOR: How flattering.\nVORENA: And we've got Arcantis, our main political broadcaster, onside too - he’s been making sure the coverage puts you ina favourable light. Gallifrey is ready to follow you, Doctor.\nLEELA: Doctor...?\nDOCTOR: She makes a compelling case.\nVORENA: And we thought you might like to join him again, Leela.\nLEELA: What?\nVORENA: We know he works best with an outsider next to him. Tegan isn’t right for the job — always doubting and complaining. He needs someone alive to dangers.\nDOCTOR: What do you think?\nVORENA: Take the controls. Begin a new era.\nDOCTOR: All right.\nDOCTOR: THE GROAN BECOMES A CONTENTED HUM.\nDOCTOR: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 149\nDOCTOR: Hello, old fella.

CAPITOL\nDOCTOR: LOWRI AND KASNEGAR.\nLOWRI: Now this was definitely not in the brief!\nTEGAN: What the heck are we going to do?\nLOWRI: Can we cut the power?\nKASNEGAR: I don’t know.\nTEGAN: Fat lot of use you are.\nLOWRI: We can try — get me the technicians at the Eye Of Harmony.\nTEGAN: But the Doctor’s in there!\nKASNEGAR: This was all done for the Doctor!\nTEGAN: What?\nTEGAN: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 151\nTEGAN: SCENE 19. INT. CONTROL ROOM\nVORENA: How does it feel?\nDOCTOR: Remarkably comfortable, Vorena.\nLEELA: Doctor...\nDOCTOR: Mm?\nLEELA: I am not sure about this.\nDOCTOR: Why not?\nLEELA: You have always taken the side of the weak, the oppressed.\nVORENA: You can still do that.\nDOCTOR: She’s right, we could. And with this kind of power —\nLEELA: It is too much power.\nVORENA: I don’t think the people you’d help would think it’s too much, not when you’re saving lives.\nDOCTOR: Imagine if we always won.\nLEELA: But it should not be too easy!\nVORENA: Nonsense —\nLEELA: When power can be used too easily, it becomes used too lightly — you would not know where to stop. You would become the oppressor, Doctor.\nLEELA: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 152\nVORENA: You wouldn’t be corrupted — I believe that. Don’t listen to her.\nDOCTOR: Why, because you think she might change my mind?\nVORENA: I know you’ve got a lot of respect [for —]\nDOCTOR: Oh, she won’t change my mind.\nVORENA: Good.\nDOCTOR: Because I already agree with her. I always intended to refuse your offer.\nLEELA: Ha!\nVORENA: But you said — at your trial, you said we should fight evils and -\nDOCTOR: I was wrong. Without the non-intervention policy, you’d be a\nDOCTOR: bunch of all-powerful intergalactic prefects, telling so-called\nDOCTOR: lesser civilisations you know what’s best for them.\nVORENA: It wouldn’t be like that!\nDOCTOR: It would be exactly like that. I work with the oppressed, I don’t just sweep in and rescue them. It’s worked rather well far — I do usually win, you know.\nVORENA: You coward. You’re afraid of the power.\nDOCTOR: Of course I’m afraid of the power. Anyone should be.\nVORENA: I’m not.\nDOCTOR: I know you’ve put a lot of time and effort into this thing —\nDOCTOR: sO\nDOCTOR: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 153\nVORENA: If you won’t use it, I will.\nDOCTOR: I thought you might say that. Leela?\nLEELA: Yes?\nDOCTOR: Destroy the controls.\nVORENA: No!\nLEELA: With pleasure. (STABS CONSOLE REPEATEDLY) Ya! Ya! Yaaa! (ETC)\nSPARKS: FLY, SYSTEMS FAIL, THROUGH:\nVORENA: You can’t cripple a TARDIS just like that — it’1ll start to repair itself —\nDOCTOR: It will, but it won’t finish repairing itself before it dematerialises and locks itself in a time loop.\nVORENA: What?\nDOCTOR: What did you think I was doing with the controls just now? Changing the dematerialisation noise to Beethoven’s Fifth?\nVORENA: You can’t [do —]\nDOCTOR: I already have. I told you I usually win.\nLEELA: (FINISHED STABBING) Shouldn’t we get out of here?\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nVORENA: No.\nVORENA: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 154\nDOCTOR: Don’t be ridiculous — we’ve got five minutes before this entire complex is banished from this dimension permanently.\nLEELA: Five minutes?\nVORENA: I won’t let you throw all this away!\nDOCTOR: You don’t have a choice.\nVORENA: I can repair the damage.\nDOCTOR: The time loop can’t be broken. I sealed it with the Thimble Of Rassilon.\nLEELA: Is that what that thing is for?\nDOCTOR: Apparently so.\nVORENA: I'll break the seal!\nDOCTOR: Give this up and come with us. You’re better than this, Vorena.\nVORENA: I thought you were.\nLEELA: Doctor — leave her. Come on!\nLEELA: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 155\nLEELA: SCENE 20. EXT. CAPITOL\nLOWRI: (INTO COMMS) You bet there’ll be a full investigation! Out!\nLOWRI: Unbelievable. That thing has its own private link to the Eye Of Harmony. I can’t believe Vorena set this thing up right under my nose -\nTEGAN: What’s it doing now?\nLOWRI: Dematerialising.\nTEGAN: But it can’t!\nLOWRI: It’ll take a few minutes, judging by the sheer size of it.\nTEGAN: We need to get the Doctor out!\nLOWRI: You heard Kasnegar — the Doctor wanted this. He can have it!\nTEGAN: No! Lowri — you’ve got this wrong! Listen!\nTEGAN: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 156\nTEGAN: SCENE 21. INT. CORRIDOR\nLEELA: Doctor, where are we going?\nDOCTOR: I know a way out.\nLEELA: How?\nDOCTOR: My mind touched the mind of this TARDIS when I operated the controls, I saw the layout. We turn here —\nDOCTOR: Oh.\nLEELA: It’s a dead end!\nDOCTOR: Well... I suppose it might be down...\nLEELA: How long do we have left?\nDOCTOR: Um... forty-five seconds.\nLEELA: Doctor...\nDOCTOR: sorry.\nLEELA: What you did was right.\nDOCTOR: Bungled it rather, though, didn’t I?\nLEELA: Doctor...?\nDOCTOR: Yes -\nDOCTOR: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 157\nLEELA: Tegan!\nTEGAN: Come on — get in!\nDOCTOR: Right!\nDOCTOR: DEMATERIALISES.\nDOCTOR: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 158\nDOCTOR: SCENE 22. EXT. CAPITOL\nDOCTOR: DEMATERIALISES. CHATTER AMONG CROWD RISES.\nARCANTIS: And... the Capitol has dematerialised.\nKESNELL: I have to say, I was not expecting that at all.\nARCANTIS: (TRYING TO GATHER HIMSELF) Well! In his short reign so far, the President certainly has sprung some surprises on the public —\nKESNELL: Is it coming back?\nARCANTIS: I think this is the clearest sign yet that we’re entering an exciting new age of Gallifreyan politics —\nKESNELL: The Capitol has just vanished.\nARCANTIS: And I’m sure that, whatever the explanation behind this turn of events, it’ll be good news for Gallifrey’s future. I’d stake my reputation on it.\nARCANTIS: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 159\nARCANTIS: SCENE 23. INT. TARDIS\nDOCTOR: What model is this, Lowri?\nLOWRI: Type Double X.\nDOCTOR: Oh! Emergency use.\nLEELA: How did you find us so quickly in that enormous building?\nTEGAN: You know when she joked about having him tagged?\nLEELA: Yes?\nTEGAN: That wasn’t a joke.\nDOCTOR: Outrageous.\nLOWRI: Or you could say thank you.\nLEELA: Thank you.\nLOWRI: You know, when it dematerialised I thought you’d accepted their offer, but Tegan convinced me otherwise.\nDOCTOR: Of course I hadn’t.\nTEGAN: Or you could say thank you.\nDOCTOR: The Capitol is trapped in a time loop.\nLEELA: And Vorena too. What a shame.\nLEELA: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 160\nDOCTOR: It’s the Capitol I feel sorry for. The largest TARDIS ever made, and a few minutes after attaining self-awareness, he gets sent on an endless journey to nowhere.\nLOWRI: I’m most concerned about you, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Why?\nLOWRI: Do you realise the resources that went into building the new Capitol? A building which you signed off on?\nDOCTOR: Aha! I have the perfect way to spin this.\nLOWRI: Good.\nDOCTOR: You tell everyone I had the Capitol TARDIS built as a vast abuse of my position, and then I stole it and ran away.\nTEGAN: Finally!\nLOWRI: Would everyone really believe that?\nLOWRI: WEARING.\nDOCTOR: Lowri, could you hold the Thimble of Rassilon please?\nLOWRI: But Doctor, [you —]\nLEELA: Who’1l1 take over?\nDOCTOR: I do have a suggestion. Here — Sash of Rassilon.\nLOWRI: Who?\nLOWRI: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 161\nDOCTOR: Someone who’s warned everyone from the beginning what a bad idea it was to have me as President. Rod — Staff —\nLOWRI: (BEAT) Me? No, I couldn’t —\nDOCTOR: Lowri, I am appointing you Over-Chancellor, which means when I’m gone, you will automatically become Acting President. Coronet.\nTEGAN: You know how this place works better than anyone — of course you can do it.\nLOWRI: I suppose...\nDOCTOR: Now, if you can just drop me off at my TARDIS — Leela? It might be tricky for you, as a known associate of mine...\nLEELA: I will stay and ride it out.\nDOCTOR: (A LITTLE SADLY) As you wish.\nLOWRI: Here we are.\nDOCTOR: Thank you, Lowri. And not just for this. You actually were a great help.\nLOWRI: It’s been... an experience.\nTEGAN: Goodbye, Leela. Hope we see you again.\nDOCTOR: I’m sure we will.\nLEELA: He always says he will come back, but...\nLEELA: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 162\nLOWRI: Go, before anyone sees you.\nLOWRI: #230: TIME IN OFFICE by Eddie Robson (FINAL) Page 163\nLOWRI: SCENE 24. INT. CORRIDOR [CONTINUOUS]\nTEGAN: There she is! Come on, Doctor! Key!\nDOCTOR: Back to Frontios it is, then.\nTEGAN: Stop saying that. (AS SHE ENTERS) Come on. After all that — you can’t be sad to be leaving.\nDOCTOR: No. But it might have been nice to take one last look around the place before I went.\nTEGAN: You’1l be back.\nDOCTOR: Perhaps. But imagine how bad things will have to have got, if the Time Lords ever call me back again. (ENTERS)\nDOCTOR: THE END"
