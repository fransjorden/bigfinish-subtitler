Hold fire, Sergeant Gredd.\nSTENN: See how their star-pods flounder without a leader. Like limbs on a body when you’ve removed the head.\nGREDD: (GRUNTING LAUGH) Aye, Marshal. I remember that Velosian commandant.\nSTENN: The Jalanx have learned their lesson here, just as the Velosians did on the Ninth Moon. Yet another Rutan ally discovers its folly. All those who stand against the Empire will feel the sting of the Six-Twentieth Attack Fleet.\nSTENN: (FX: COMMS ALERT) Major Vlaar? Report.\nVLAAR: (D — VIA COMMS) Six gravity spheres remain, Marshal Stenn.\nVLAAR: Captain Trab and Sergeant Klor died as warriors.\nSTENN: Yes. I saw.\nVLAAR: (D) Permission to pick off the remaining Jalanx, sir?\nSTENN: Granted, Major. You’ve earned it.\nSTENN: What’s that?\nGREDD: Urgent transmission from Sontar Command. New orders, Marshal.\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 2\nSTENN: Go ahead, Sergeant.\nGREDD: We are to move to these co-ordinates and await further instruction.\nSTENN: (TAKING PRINTOUT) I see. We are the nearest available company... Hmmm. Sergeant Gredd. Signal the capsules. Have them return to the Command Ship. Once they’ve mopped up.\nGREDD: There is also this, Major. A video attachment. Putting it on- screen.\nSTENN: A transmission, eh? Good. It is some time since I saw the Imperial newsreel. Let us see how close the Five Hundredth have come to our death-tally.\nGREDD: No, Marshal. This is not from Sontar Command.\nSTENN: What then?\nGREDD: It appears to be a.. commercial.\nGARUNDEL: (ON SCREEN) Sick of the same-old slaughter-appliances?

We’re looking for the most dangerous man on Earth.\nWILL: (FOLLOWING) Or off it.\nKLEIN: Hardly the time to catch up on your T.V. viewing.\nDOCTOR: Dr Klein. Mr Arrowsmith. I hope you’ve made yourselves at home. (FX: STOP AD, RAPID REWIND TO TOP) Take a look at this.\nGARUNDEL: (ON SCREEN) Sick of the same-old slaughter-appliances? [In need a killer new killing-machine? Then look no further. Garundel Galactic. For all your death-dealing needs...]\nWILL: What is that?\nKLEIN: Some sort of toad-man?\nDOCTOR: Urodelian. Native to the swamps of the third planet of the Urodel system. Notorious collectors and traders. Some might say thieves and pirates.\nWILL: He certainly appears to have some amphibian ancestry. Although, I’d say the shape of the face and orbital sockets are quite different from those of a toad, Dr Klein.\nDOCTOR: Quite right, Will. That amphibian ancestry means Urodelians can re-grow parts of their body. Rather handy, given some of the more crudely punitive judicial regimes in this part of the galaxy.\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 4\nWILL: Like a salamander?\nDOCTOR: Exactly. This individual.. Garundel.. is a particularly slippery specimen.\nKLEIN: You talk as if you know him.\nDOCTOR: A passing acquaintance. A long time ago.\nKLEIN: It seems you’re in the habit of looking up old acquaintances...\nDOCTOR: But aren’t you glad I did?\nKLEIN: I’1l let you know. (BEAT) So. Why him? Why now?\nWILL: What’s stacked up behind him? Are those missiles?\nDOCTOR: Among other horrors. Listen, both of you.\nGARUNDEL: (VIA VIEWSCREEN, VOLUME COMES UP) [.. So don’t miss this exclusive offer.] Roll up, roll up. For the sale of the millennium. Heck, the billennium! Blasters, tanks, missiles and bombs. No bang too big or micro-laser too small. If you’ve got the credits, I’ve got the kill-sticks. Cash buyers get preferential rates. Just name your method of destruction we’1l have something that fits the bill. Or the kill. [On application to attend, you become a preferred bidder, and you can browse our auction guide while you wait for the secret co-ordinates. ]\nKLEIN: A giant frog running a closing-down weapons sale. It’s a curiosity, I admit. But I fail to see how it gets us any nearer-\nDOCTOR: This is the interesting part.\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 5\nGARUNDEL: (ON VIEWSCREEN) Trouble with hard to reach insurgents? Got a rebel faction you just can’t shift? The Persuasion Machine could be just what you need.\nKLEIN: Persuasion Machine?\nGARUNDEL: (ON VIEWSCREEN) Developed by Dr Kurt Schalk of Earth. Mid-20™ Century vintage. This was one ape-man way ahead of his time. Download our free catalogue, and you’1l see the full documentation confirming this as the genuine article.\nDOCTOR: Sounds familiar? Here, Elizabeth. Look at the catalogue.\nGARUNDEL: (ON VIEWSCREEN) The Persuasion Machine comes complete with owner manual stored in its creator’s brain. Purchase of the Machine and manual includes Kurt Schalk’s body at no extra charge.\nKLEIN: Pause it, there!\nWILL: That’s him! That’s Schalk!\nKLEIN: Could be. Hard to tell, what with the hood and the cage.\nWILL: He’s auctioning Dr Schalk? Along with his machine?\nDOCTOR: The power to change the way people think. Sold. To the highest bidder.\nWILL: Who is this message being sent to? Who’s invited along to this... auction?\nDOCTOR: Oh, Garundel knows his market. He’s bombarding the secure channels of all the warlike species clustered around this part of space.\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 6\nKLEIN: You make it sound like the skies are teeming with them.\nDOCTOR: They are. This end of Mutter’s Spiral seems to attract the belligerent. Humans included. Must be the feng shui. As for your question, Mr Arrowsmith. ‘Who’s invited?’ We are.\nKLEIN: You mean... You want us to go in there and buy Kurt Schalk?\nDOCTOR: No, Elizabeth. I want you to go in there and steal Kurt Schalk.\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 7\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 3: INT. GARUNDEL’S SALES OFFICE\nZIV: (READING) Incoming. One-sixty. One-eighty... Two hundred thousand credits...\nGARUNDEL: Fabulissimo! Move it all to the secure account and clear the buffers for the next one.\nZIV: Looks like it’s gonna be a full house, Mr G.\nGARUNDEL: Course it is! Chalk another one up to my natural showmanship. Take a missive, Miss Ziv... (CHUCKLES) Oooh, that’1ll never get old!\nZIV: I’m on it Mr G. (FX: STARTS TYPING)\nGARUNDEL: Vicious bunch of lizards. But loaded with the riches of twelve systems. (BEAT) Don’t write that down.\nZIV: Oh... (FX: HASTY DELETING)\nGARUNDEL: (DICTATING) Thank you for your deposit which is gratefully received. Garundel Galactic Enterprises take great pleasure in confirming your attendance... Yadda, yadda, yadda.\nZIV: Got it.\nGARUNDEL: And send the co-ordinates.\nZIV: Here comes another one.\nGARUNDEL: This is going better than I’d dared hope. We already recouped what we paid the Spivelyn.\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 8\nZIV: Yeah, I thought they’d hold out for more.\nGARUNDEL: Some goods are too hot to handle... This’ll be big. Maybe enough to retire. Got my eye on a land-mass on a little marsh-planet\nGARUNDEL: near the Urodel system. Far enough from home so I can embargo\nGARUNDEL: my siblings. But close enough for them to hear me rattling my\nGARUNDEL: coinage.\nZIV: One-eighty... One-ninety.. two hundred thousand creds. That’s a cool coupla million now, boss.\nGARUNDEL: And that’s before they’ve even started the bidding. All goes to show — you get the right product, they’1ll kill themselves to find you.\nZIV: Let’s hope they don’t start killing each other when they get here...\nGARUNDEL: Oh, I think they can be persuaded otherwise...\nZIV: Should I go ahead and send out the reply? Think I got the hang of it now...\nGARUNDEL: Knock yourself out, Ziv-girl. I’m so glad the agency found me somebody so... adaptable.\nZIV: It’s interesting work, Mr G. And I get to travel too.\nGARUNDEL: Some people can get icky about their moral position. Selling weapons of mass destruction.\nZIV: We all gotta make a living... It’s not like we’re pulling the triggers, is it?\nGARUNDEL: See — that’s what I like about you. A rational outlook. Just like me. (FX: MORE CREDITS BEING RECEIVED) Forget the continent! Looks like I’m gonna be buying the whole planet...\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 9\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 4: INT. SONTARAN COMMAND VESSEL, CORRIDOR\nVLAAR: (WALKING) I cannot believe Sontar Command have released funds to this... salesman.\nSTENN: (WALKING) It pains me to let a single credit pass to a creature like that. But.. (BEAT) I’d like you by my side, Major Vlaar. In case of complications. We’ll take your sphere down to the surface.\nVLAAR: What race is it? This hawker of arms?\nSTENN: Urodelian. A breed of scavengers. Mercenaries. Bottom-feeders. They are beneath us.\nVLAAR: Than why must we deal with it? Why not simply crush it in our fist?\nSTENN: High Command knows this... payment is for the greater good.\nVLAAR: This is not the way Sontar fights. We use our might to subjugate. We do not... pay for favours.\nSTENN: (STOPPING) Vlaar. I tell you this because I trust you. But it goes no further.\nVLAAR: (STOPPING) Marshal?\nSTENN: The Imperial Fleet is engaged across more than a thousand star systems. The clonebanks are at capacity. Why do you think we have seen no reinforcements?\nVLAAR: The Six-Twentieth needs no special treatment...\nSTENN: We began our campaign with thirty capsules. We now have six.\nVLAAR: They all died well.\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 10\nSTENN: I do not deny that. But hatchlings are in demand on every front. It is regrettable, but we must find new ways of waging war. To prevent the Rutans gaining ground.\nVLAAR: Death to the Rutan scum! Glory to Sontar!\nSTENN: Indeed. (BEAT) This Persuasion device... This Terran scientist. Both are sought by many races. Our orders are to secure them. If only to prevent others gaining the advantage. Others who may assist the Rutan Host.\nVLAAR: The Six-Twentieth is Sontar’s finest attack squad! We destroyed the Rutan fleet at Wendron’s Pass. We eradicated the assembled hordes of the Velosions in the Seventh System. We are not... errand-boys to be sent... shopping.\nSTENN: Respect the chain of command, Major Vlaar. High Command has good reason. Besides. We will flex our muscles soon enough. No more credits will be wasted on this costermonger.. As far as he is concerned, Marshal Stenn, veteran of the Six-Twentieth Attack Fleet, is simply... browsing.\nSTENN: Sergeant Gredd. Report.\nGREDD: (VIA COM) All is prepared, Marshal. We have the final co- ordinates.\nSTENN: (WALKING ON) Lead the way to your capsule, Major.\nVLAAR: (FOLLOWING) For the glory of Sontar!\nSTENN: For the glory of Sontar.\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 11\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 5: INT. TARDIS — CONTROL ROOM\nKLEIN: I feel ridiculous.\nWILL: You look rather... striking, ma’am. If you don’t mind me saying... sorry.\nKLEIN: And you look preposterous. Doctor, couldn’t you have found him a uniform that fitted?\nDOCTOR: So. Commander Elizarra Klineforth of the Zebrednik Horde. Meet Captain Will-Valar. Your man-at-arms.\nKLEIN: Is all this leather really necessary?\nDOCTOR: You have to look the part, Elizabeth.\nKLEIN: So. What about you? You haven’t even changed. What have you come as?\nDOCTOR: Your getaway driver.\nWILL: The Doctor’s not actually going in with us.\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid I can’t join you at the auction itself. As I said, Garundel knows me of old. I would only raise suspicion.\nKLEIN: And me dressed as a fetish queen from Mars wouldn’t?\nDOCTOR: Mr Arrowsmith and I scanned the TARDIS database to find some appropriate profiles. The Lost Warlords of Zebrednik. From far enough away that few would know them. But near enough to plausibly make the trip.\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 12\nWILL: Their physiognomy is close enough to human as makes no odds. Strange how evolution progressed on some of the outer rimworlds... I’ve always found it fascinating how many of Earth’s invaders resembled us so closely in so many ways. And even those who didn’t still appear at the very least to have evolved from a similar physical structure... I wonder if there’s a biological template of sorts, whether-\nDOCTOR: (INTERRUPTING) Now. Mr Arrowsmith. Would you like to present arms to your leader? Imagine she’s a fearsome warrior queen with no compassion. No sympathy of any kind.\nWILL: (FLUSTERED) I- I- Well of course... I’d never actually think that of you ma’am.. but for the purposes of the undercover mission... Would you mind terribly if I-\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO, SMILING) I can’t imagine it’s too much of a stretch.\nKLEIN: I heard that, Doctor.\nWILL: Oops. Sorry! Heavier than it looks.\nKLEIN: Look out! Is this wise, Doctor? He’s going to vaporise us if he’s not careful.\nDOCTOR: Don’t worry. They’re not loaded.\nKLEIN: Oh, that makes me feel so much safer...\nDOCTOR: Besides, the auction operates under an amnesty. As soon as you arrive, all weapons must be surrendered to the host. It’s in the small print. That multi-photon rifle is only for show. Now: we’re about to arrive on the planetoid where Garundel has pitched his stall. (GIVING KLEIN AND WILL COMMUNICATORS) Here. Take these.\nWILL: (TAKING PHONE) What are they? Communication devices?\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 13\nKLEIN: Yes. They certainly date your Dictaphone, Mr Arrowsmith.\nDOCTOR: Garundel has scramblers and jammers criss-crossing the sales dome, but there are gaps around the edges. These twenty-first century mobile telephones are actually our best bet for keeping in touch. I’ve lashed up a network via the TARDIS. So long as you’ve two bars on the display, we should be able to hear each other.\nWILL: (FX: PRESSING BUTTONS ON PHONE) Voice-recorder... stopwatch... camera... some kind of... video-game? ‘Furious Avians’?\nDOCTOR: I thought you might like them. They’re only a few years into your future. Communication is about to make a quantum leap. Internet, email, Twitter. All the rage come the twenty-teens.\nKLEIN: When you’ve quite finished showing off your gadgets — I do have one question, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Yes, Elizabeth?\nKLEIN: What if the real versions of our aliases turn up?\nDOCTOR: Ah.. That’s the thing about the ‘Lost Warlords of Zebrednik’. (BEAT) They’re lost.\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 14\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 6: INT. SALES DOME, FOYER\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: MILLING ALIENS, GROWLS, MUTTERING, MUZAK IN B/G, SWISH OF\nENTRANCE: DOORS)\nGARUNDEL: (CALLING) Welcome, welcome. One and all. Please... Don’t stand on ceremony. We’re all friends here. You’re entitled to a complimentary beverage of your choice. Fell free to scan for any life-threatening additives before consumption. And don’t forget to hand your weapons in at reception. We’re all about the trust here at Garundel Galactic.\nGARUNDEL: (FX: GROWLING CREATURE SCANS A DRINK BEFORE TAKING, AND\nWANDERING: OFF)\nWANDERING: There ya go fella. Won’t kill ya. We’re all on equal terms here. (SOTTO) All that matters is the size of your wallet.\nZIV: (APPROACHING) Mr G. May I introduce Krakenmother Benarra. Queen of the Krellor systems. And her Squire, Asalla.\nBENARRA: Urodelian. How long am I to tarry with these... degenerates?\nGARUNDEL: No need to be so formal. Please, call me Garundel, Benarra. Can I call you Benarra?\nASALLA: No, you cannot. Urodelian.\nGARUNDEL: Thank you, Ziv. Best get back to the front desk. (TO BENARRA) Can I offer you a refreshment before the auction? Orange? Tomato juice? Gamorrean wine?\nBENARRA: The only refreshment I require is the spine-fluid of my enemies once I have crushed the life from their pitiful bodies.\nGARUNDEL: Hmm. We’re right out of spine fluid. (BEAT) Tempt you with an elderflower cordial?\nASALLA: We will wait for the weapons.\nGARUNDEL: My associate is just welcoming the last few guests. Then we can get this show on the road.\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 15\nGARUNDEL: Ah - looks like the Sontarans are here.\nBENARRA: Sontarans? (SPITS) You invite those stunted clones to your auction?\nASALLA: This is an outrage. Sontarans? (SPITS) What other vermin infest this place? Who next? Bandrils?\nGARUNDEL: That a problem? I like to think I offer a haven from all the warmongering so you can recharge and begin the slaughter afresh. With all-new toys. (HARDER) We’re not gonna have any trouble, are we, Krakenmother? I want us all to play nice while we’re here.\nBENARRA: I will take pleasure in outbidding them at every sale.\nGARUNDEL: Good-good. (GOING OFF) The Bandrils sent their excuses, by the way...\nBENARRA: (SOTTO) And then eviscerating them as soon as we are ready to depart. Come, Asalla!\nASALLA: (NASTY LAUGH) It will be a pleasure, Krakenmothexr...\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 16\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 7: INT. SALES DOME, RECEPTION [CONTINUOUS ]\nZIV: Thank you for coming along to Garundel Galactic today. I hope you found our secret location without any trouble. Pleasant journey?\nVLAAR: All lesser races flee before a Sontaran Command Ship.\nZIV: Course they do. Could have done with you on the Kessel run last month! Got stuck on the planetary bypass for three days.\nZIV: If I could just have your names, please? Check you off my list.\nVLAAR: I am Major Vlaar. This is Marshal Stenn of the Sontaran Empire’s Six-Twentieth Attack Fleet. Bloodletter of the Ninth Moon of Velos. Ravager of the Doghead Nebula.\nZIV: (TYPING) And how are you spelling that...\nVLAAR: What?\nZIV: Bloodletter.. Is that two T’s or one? For the badge.\nSTENN: What is the creature saying, Vlaar? I need no badge.\nVLAAR: You heard the Marshal, female. A Sontaran Officer needs no badge.\nZIV: But you do kind of... look the same... (BEAT) OK.\nZIV: (FX: SCRUNCHES UP PAPER) No badge. But I do need to check in your weapons. That’s two.. rifles... and one.. laser stick? What do you call that thing?\nVLAAR: A Sontaran Marshal does not relinquish his swagger-stick.\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 17\nZIV: It did say on the invitation... Erm.. Just one second... (CALLS) Mr G!\nVLAAR: Besides. I am Sontaran. My body is a weapon. The most perfect weapon ever devised.\nZIV: Ooooh..Kay. (BEAT, LOUDER) Mr G!\nGARUNDEL: (ARRIVING) Hey, what’s the hold-up? Not a problem, I hope? Hello representatives of the mighty Sontaran Empire! You know, I look at you guys, and I think... disintegrators. (SOTTO) That, and heels.\nVLAAR: What?\nGARUNDEL: Disintegrators. You’re in the market for some planetary disintegrators, I’1ll bet. (OFFERING HAND) Garundel. Of Garundel Galactic. Pleasure to meet you.\nSTENN: Your minion requests our weapons. And that we wear identification.\nZIV: I did say we could make an exception on the badges, Mr Stenn.\nVLAAR: Marshal Stenn.\nZIV: Marshal? I like that name. I went out with a guy called Marshal once. He used to live over in the-\nVLAAR: It is not a name. It is a rank.\nGARUNDEL: So sorry, Marshal, Major. My assistant is very new to all this... Still training her up...\nZIV: (BEGINNING TO PROTEST) Wha-?!\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 18\nGARUNDEL: (SOTTO) Go with it, sweetie.. (ALOUD) Listen. I know, and you know — Sontaran officers do not need a weapon to decimate the field. If things turn nasty... Hand-to-hand combat... I know who my money’s on.\nSTENN: That is good. You... recognise the might of the unarmed Sontaran warrior.\nGARUNDEL: Let you into a little secret, guys. There’s an E.M. field around this whole sales dome, so energy weapons are pretty much useless. Except maybe as clubs. Which I’m sure a big tough soldier like you just wouldn’t need.\nSTENN: Here, girl. Take care of my arms. They are precious. Major. Give her your Meson rifle.\nGARUNDEL: See. They’re sealed away. Safe and secure.\nZIV: We'll take care of your weapons like they were your babies, Marshal.\nSTENN: I sent eight of my clonespawn into the Doghead Nebula. (PROUD) They did not return.\nGARUNDEL: Even better, then. We’ll take care of your weapons like they were your.. weapons. Miss Ziv will lock them up in our security pantry. Same goes for all the other guests. They’1ll be safe and sound. Alongside all our own auction items, of course. Your security is our prime concern.\nZIV: All done. In you go.\nSTENN: Come Vlaar. Let us see what alien scum we have to contend with.\nZIV: (WHISPER) Sorry Mr G. Did I mess up?\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 19\nGARUNDEL: (TO ZIV) No, no. You gotta go with the flow sometimes, little buddy...\nZIV: (TO GARUNDEL) But Sontarans.. Ain’t that a bit of a risk? Inviting the likes of them?\nGARUNDEL: (TO ZIV) I know... Everybody hates ‘em. But they’re loaded, so everybody’s gonna try and outbid them. I asked them along to push the prices up.\nZIV: Oooh. You are clever, Mr G.\nGARUNDEL: You better believe it, blue.\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 20\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 8: EXT. PLANETOID, OUTSIDE SALES DOME\nKLEIN: So. We’re here. (BEAT) Where are we again?\nWILL: It doesn’t have a name. Planetoid Q-987. A.. (UNSURE) G-class? No, J-class planetoid. Uninhabited. No natural resources. No strategic value. It’s basically an insignificant rock in space.\nKLEIN: You seem to have got the hang of the TARDIS databases. I’11l give you that, Mr Arrowsmith.\nWILL: Thank you. Ma’am.\nKLEIN: Drop the ma’am. It’s Commander, remember. ‘Wil-valar’.\nWILL: Yes. Yes, of course. Commander.\nKLEIN: That dome over there. I suppose that must be our destination.\nWILL: A desert on a boulder in the middle of nowhere. Just the sort of place you’d open a branch of Guns R Us.\nKLEIN: (SETTING OFF) Come on.\nKLEIN: Doctor? You couldn’t resist trying out your technology.\nDOCTOR: (DISTORT, VIA PHONE) Elizabeth. Didn’t you know? It’s good to talk.\nKLEIN: I’1ll put you on speaker.\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 21\nDOCTOR: (D, SPEAKER) My preliminary scans have found a concealed hatchway. Fifty metres from the sales dome. By the rocks. Looks like a secure bunker. Even the TARDIS is having trouble scanning it. I’m almost certain that’s where Schalk is being held. If you could find a way of lowering its shielding, I might be able to land inside... (FX: ALARM IN TARDIS)\nKLEIN: What’s that noise? Doctor?\nDOCTOR: (D, SPEAKER) Can’t hang around too long, I’m afraid. They’11l pick me up on the next sweep.\nWILL: So you’re going into temporal orbit?\nDOCTOR: (D) Very good, Mr Arrowsmith. I won’t be far. Ready to land just as soon as you give the signal.\nKLEIN: (SARCASTIC) What could possibly go wrong?\nDOCTOR: (D) That’s the spirit, Elizabeth! Happy bidding!\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 22\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 9: INT. SALES DOME, RECEPTION\nGARUNDEL: Help yourself to the courtesy Cristal. Another crostini?\nGARUNDEL: Sure, take twelve...\nZIV: (WHISPER) Mr G. Dunno if it’s a problem... But the proximity sensors picked... something up. Just for a second. A ship. But not a ship. Like nuffink we got on record.\nGARUNDEL: But it’s gone now?\nZIV: Totally.\nGARUNDEL: Hmmm. Just a blip. No doubt there are all kinds wanting to stick their noses, beaks, and assorted mandibles in. Keep an eye on the sensors. You got all the weapons stashed?\nZIV: Yep. Our... guest’s smelling pretty ripe.\nGARUNDEL: That’s OK. Won’t be holding him much longer. Anyways, I’m almost out of vivifiers. Everybody here?\nZIV: All guests accounted for... except...\nZIV: Ah. That’1l be them.\nGARUNDEL: (GOING OVER) Hello! You must be the Zebrednik party. Glad you could make it. Let’s get you checked in.\nWILL: Thank you.\nZIV: If I could just take your names...\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 23\nWILL: I am Wil-valar of the Lost Zebrednik Warlords. Sorry... ‘Warlords of Zebrednik.’ And this is my commanding officer. Elizarra Klineforth. Also of the.. er Lost Warlords. Of Zebrednik. (BEAT) That’s N-I-K. No C.\nZIV: Ta babes.\nGARUNDEL: I leave you in the capable hands of my associate. Miss Ziv. OK... (CLAPPING HANDS, CALLING) If everyone could assemble in the main hall in five minutes. I know you’re all keen to get back to your killing and maiming. (GOING OFF) So let’s see if we can’t fit you out with some new accoutrements.\nWILL: Looks like you’re very busy today.\nZIV: Yes we are, babes. Mr G is a whiz at the old marketing.\nKLEIN: So it appears. A very smooth operator.\nZIV: Here we are. (HANDING OVER BADGES) One for you, Commander Klineforth and one for you, Wil-valar.\nWILL: Call me Will.\nZIV: OK. One last thing for check-in. If I could just take your guns... Thanks so much. (FX: WEAPONS BEING HANDED OVER) I’11 store them away in here. They’1l be held in our security pantry for the duration of the sale.\nWILL: Do you want a hand with that? It looks rather heavy. All that firepower must weigh a ton...\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 24\nZIV: Aww. You’re a sweetie. But look.\nZIV: Hover-trolley. Even a little thing like me can push it around. (GOING OFF) See ya later!\nKLEIN: Will... (REMEMBERS ALIAS) -valar. Stay here. Keep an eye on this Miss Ziv. She seems to like you.\nWILL: Do you think so? I’m never very good at reading those kinds of Signals. Particularly difficult, what with the antennae and... everything. But yes. Yes. It seems logical that she’d have security clearance. Handling the weapons, I mean. It could definitely be worthwhile. What about you, ma’am?\nKLEIN: I’ll have a recce. Try and find a signal. (WALKING OFF) Let’s see if the Doctor’s toys actually work...\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 25\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 10: INT. SALES DOME, FOYER\nVLAAR: Look at them. The lesser species. They dare to call themselves warriors. (GETTING ANGRY) Look! There! Farenians. They allied themselves with the Rutans on Borinor, I will-\nSTENN: (HOLDING HIM BACK) Wait Major. I know it goes against your instincts. But we must play this game for a short time at least. It is clear that none of these aliens should be allowed to take the Persuasion device.\nVLAAR: And we will see to it they will not. (ANNOYED GRUNT) I do not know how you contain yourself so calmly, Marshal.\nSTENN: High Command has deemed it necessary. Think of the end. Not the means.\nVLAAR: Look at that one. The Krelloran. She calls herself the Krakenmother. She glares at us. (ANGRY GRUNT) Now she is gone.\nSTENN: Hm. Our signals are blocked. Perhaps it is this Urodelian’s electro-magnetic field. We will need to find an unshielded transmission location.\nVLAAR: No doubt all communication will be monitored.\nSTENN: I have anticipated this. Gredd has his orders. You need only send the signal. Then. Weapon or no weapon, you can set about these aliens.\nVLAAR: I will run bio-scans for Rutan spies.\nSTENN: Carry on, Major Vlaar. We need not maintain this sham for long.\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 26\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 11: INT. SALES DOME, CORRIDOR\nKLEIN: (TO PHONE) Doctor... Come in Doctor. (FRUSTRATED) Ah... signal lost!\nKLEIN: Nothing. The shielding’s too strong.\nDOCTOR: (VIA PHONE, HEAVY INTERFERENCE) Come in ‘Commander Klineforth’. Are you receiving?\nKLEIN: (INTO PHONE) Doctor? I can barely hear you...\nDOCTOR: (D) Keep moving. There’s a communication bubble. Ten metres ahead of you...\nKLEIN: (INTO PHONE) Doctor? Do you hear me now?\nBENARRA: (CALLING FROM BEHIND) Zebrednik. Commander. You have... lost your way?\nKLEIN: (HURRIEDLY HIDING PHONE) Just... admiring the décor. We’re not big on downlighting and potted plants on... Zebrednik.\nBENARRA: No. I don’t suppose you are. What was that... device?\nKLEIN: Oh... Oh... Nothing. Just taking a few.. photos. For the folks back home.\nBENARRA: (OVERLY PLEASANT) I see. I thought you were speaking into it. But then you could not have been. Because communication is forbidden for the duration of the auction.\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 27\nKLEIN: Of course... (BEAT) Have you... come far?\nBENARRA: (HARDER) You do not know me?\nKLEIN: Forgive me. You see so many faces in this line of work... They all merge into one, before you have to... (TOO CHEERY) blast them off!\nBENARRA: You really do not know me? The Krakenmother of the First Krelloran Brood?\nKLEIN: Sorry. I’m normally so good with... lizards. Was it... at a party?\nBENARRA: (PRETENCE DROPPED) You do not know the destroyer of your world? The Nemesis of Zebrednik? The Krakenmother Benarra?\nKLEIN: Ah.\nBENARRA: I never expected to meet a survivor. I do not like to leave a task unfinished. A genocide incomplete.\nKLEIN: I know... I’m the same with the crossword. Well. I really should go and find my assistant...\nBENARRA: Your pup will be simple to despatch. And after you are both\nBENARRA: gone, the Zebrednik will be no more. I will not meet another.\nKLEIN: Wait. There’s something you should- (CRIES OUT IN PAIN)\nBENARRA: (TWISTING HER ARM) Look at me.\nKLEIN: (STRUGGLING) Let... me... go!\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 28\nBENARRA: We surrendered our guns to the Urodelian. But I need only my Krelloran blade to split your gizzard.\nKLEIN: Please... you don’t understand!\nBENARRA: See how it shines... Look upon me, Zebrednik. You should remember this face. It will be the last one you ever see.\nKLEIN: No!\nKLEIN: END OF PART ONE\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 29"

Trust me, we don’t want to draw her attention.\nWILL: I don’t understand. Did something upset her? Some misunderstanding over social customs, perhaps?\nKLEIN: There’s been a misunderstanding all right. It turns out our aliases aren’t as foolproof as the Doctor thought. Just stay away from that Krakenmother. And her Squire. So, what have I missed?\nWILL: A parade of military machinery. They’ve been showing the full firepower on screen. Then Ziv brings in samples. If these things can do everything they say, then I’ve several undiscovered branches of physics to explore when we get back to the TARDIS. It’s absolutely fascinating.

Focus.\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 33\nKLEIN: How are they running things?\nWILL: It seems to be just the two of them. They’re selling the items in batches. All those at the front are up next. While Garundel takes the bids, Ziv fetches the next set of demonstration devices. That’s how it’s worked so far anyway. They seem to be rattling through the catalogue.\nKLEIN: Excellent assessment, Mr Arrowsmith.

Have you seen where they’re keeping all this stuff?\nWILL: I did what you asked. I’ve been watching her. She took all the confiscated weapons to a locker facility outside. Their ‘security pantry’. Just where the Doctor said it was. Fifty metres from the dome. Over by the rocks. There’s a hatch. She typed in a key-code and locked everything away in there.\nKLEIN: I see. All the auction items and all the customers’ valuables. All in one place.\nWILL: Yes.

We’1ll make a field agent of you yet, Mr Arrowsmith. Go ahead. Stay in contact.\nWILL: Yes, ma’am.\nKLEIN: Once Garundel’s distracted by the bidding, I’1ll try and call the Doctor again. If we run into any more complications I think we should leave.\nWILL: I’1ll be ready. Leave it to me, Ms Klein.

Don’t wanna forget that! (GOES BACK IN HATCH)\nWILL: It’s OK. She’s gone back inside.\nDOCTOR: (D) How are you planning to gain entry?\nWILL: Very useful device, this little cameraphone, Doctor. I had the idea when I was recording video in the hall...\nDOCTOR: (D, SIGNAL FADING, INTERFERENCE) I don’t have much time, Mr Arrowsmith...\nWILL: Yes, yes. Of course. Sorry. I planted it on the rocks by the hatch before Ziv came over. Zoomed in on the keypad. So when she typed in the entry code-\nDOCTOR: (D) You recorded the sequence. Very clever.\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 37\nWILL: Hang on. Here she comes again.\nZIV: (TO SELF) That’s the lot. (GOING OFF) Not long to wait now, Ziv, babe. Not long at all.\nWILL: She’s gone. Taken her trolley over to the dome. Rightio.\nDOCTOR: (D) Mr Arrowsmith? Are you there?\nWILL: I’m entering the code now.

The shields are back up! (TO PHONE) Doctor, I’m inside. But now I’m stuck. Doctor? (BEAT, REST TO SELF) No bars. No signal... Well. Might as well do some reconnaissance as I’m here. Video on. (TO CAMERA) Will Arrowsmith. In the field. Time... Unknown. Location... unknown. Oh hang on. Planetoid Q-987. Inside the Garundel Galactic security pantry. What have we got? Look for a control panel, he said. Well there are control banks here... Lots of control banks...\nWILL: (FX: CLATTER OF WEAPON BEING KNOCKED OVER, HOLLOW PLASTIC\nTUBING: FALLING)\nTUBING: Oops... Don’t want anything going off half-cocked...\nTUBING: Ah. That’s good. Everything’s labelled. Very organised. These crates... Sontaran. Fanerian.. Krelloran.. They must be the weapons taken from the aliens...\nTUBING: And over here... The items on sale.\nTUBING: Oops! Hmm. That’s odd. Half these guns are... plastic? Hollow? Perhaps they’re supposed to be like that.\nTUBING: Ah. This thing’s a bit more solid. A two-foot tall metal dome. Some sort of access panel.. A flashing blue light... Is it...\nTUBING: humming? What does the label say?\nTUBING: (READING) ‘Persuasion module Prototype B-zero-two’. I thought she took that with her...\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 39\nDOCTOR WHO: Ah.

I think it’s time we left.\nDOCTOR: (FX: ANSWERING PHONE, DISTORTED SIGNAL) Elizabeth. Can you hear me? Sorry. I’m trying to breach the shielding on that hatch. There’s another signal beaming through it. In the opposite direction. It’s all very complicated...\nKLEIN: Well. The sale’s underway. Mostly low-level stuff. Hugely advanced by UNIT standards, of course. But fairly indistinguishable from guns the galaxy over, I'd imagine. Point and shoot.\nDOCTOR: (D) What about the Machine?\nKLEIN: The Persuasion Device is Lot number seven-four-nine. Should be up in the next few minutes. Garundel seems to be in rather a hurry to finish.\nDOCTOR: (D) Yes, well. So am I.\nKLEIN: By the way. Your research was flawed, Doctor. There are aliens here who know exactly how the Lost Warlords of Zebrednik got lost.\nDOCTOR: (D) Ah. That was a risk, I suppose. Do you think we should abort the mission? I can extract you at the drop-off point.\nKLEIN: Oh no. I’m fine. Besides, Mr Arrowsmith appears to have gone missing.\nDOCTOR: (D) Not exactly. I believe I know where he is.\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 41\nKLEIN: Good. Well, Doctor, we’re running out of time. We might have to try and buy Schalk after all. How should I proceed?\nGARUNDEL: (ARRIVING, OVER DOCTOR) Quite the little hotspot here.\nKLEIN: (FX: CUTTING OFF PHONE, AND HIDING IT) My... driver... He does tend to fret.\nGARUNDEL: Driver, huh? Coulda sworn you were speaking to your doctor... Nothing life-threatening, I hope? (ANNOYED) I already gave you one warning, Commander Klineforth. You’re gonna get yourself disqualified from the bidding...\nKLEIN: Please. Mr Garundel. Rest assured. I am very interested in what you have on sale. Speaking of which, shouldn’t you be in the hall?\nGARUNDEL: In a moment. My associate is just lining up the final assortment of goodies. Some of your fellow attendees like to see the colour options. But you’re not so interested?\nKLEIN: I’m after one particular article.\nGARUNDEL: Of course. Another one holding out for my Persuasion Machine. Hope you raided your piggy-bank. Cos you’re gonna have a fight on your hands.\nKLEIN: Oh. I don’t think funds will be a problem.\nGARUNDEL: I know. I credit-checked your currency card. No limits, apparently. Interstellar Express? That’1ll do nicely. Lot seven- four-nine’s up next.\nKLEIN: In that case. I’d better make sure I keep my seat. I’1ll see you back in the hall, Mr Garundel.

Compared to the DNA profile of Lot seven-four-nine in the brochure...\nSTENN: Human. Did we not know the Zebrednik had human heritage?\nVLAAR: Yes, but more than just the species...

The one that just left.\nGARUNDEL: (WALKING) It works... but it’s a little limited, shall we say. Range, strength and time. ‘Persuasion-lite’, I call it. Not much use in a battle situation, but ideal to prime folks for a little retail therapy.\nDOCTOR: You actually built it? (STOPS) Whatever else you might be, Garundel, I can’t deny your technical genius.\nGARUNDEL: Gee, thanks. Don’t get carried away though. The ‘fluence only works for two hours. Why d’you think I was in such a hurry?\nDOCTOR: So. The most dangerous device in the universe. And you use it to carry out a confidence trick. To steal their weapons as well as their money.\nGARUNDEL: You know how much Sontaran Meson rifles fetch on the black market? Would have worked too. Just wasn’t expecting little Miss Blue to rip me off. Shoulda known that girl was too good to be true. Her antennae were too close together.\nDOCTOR: That’s not important now. You had the blueprints. But did you ever actually have its creator, I wonder?\nGARUNDEL: Oh, I got Schalk all right. In the hypership. Anyhoo — here we are.\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 60\nDOCTOR: Your podcraft. Buried in the sand.\nDOCTOR: (FX: GARUNDEL OPERATES CONTROL, BURIED PODCRAFT HATCH OPENS,\nGLOOPY: B/G AS IN ‘BLACK AND WHITE’ )\nGARUNDEL: Old faithful. This baby’s seen me through good times and bad. Patched up a dozen times over.\nDOCTOR: Just like its owner.\nGARUNDEL: (RUBBING NECK) Yeah... I blame you for my recurring whiplash. Always gotta wear a collar now. Maybe I should sue...\nDOCTOR: (CLIMBING INTO PODCRAFT) Shall we?\nGARUNDEL: As if you got a choice...\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 61\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 28: INT. HYPERSHIP (WEAPON STORE)\nWILL: (HOLDING ONTO HIS CHAIR, ABOVE ENGINE NOISE) You really shouldn’t have done that, Ziv. Thrown the Doctor out. He could have helped.\nZIV: (ABOVE ENGINES) Story of my life.. Always doing things I shouldn’a. You sit tight and let Zivvy take you for the ride of your life. (SOTTO) I don’t need anyone’s help...\nWILL: Please. Turn us around. Take us back to that planet.\nZIV: I mean it, babes. Sit there. Don’t distract. We’ll be out of this asteroid belt before you know it. (FIGHTING CONTROLS) Just gotta concentrate for a minute.\nWILL: (UNCONVINCING) I- I demand you take us back!\nZIV: Aw, bless. You don’t want me to have to tie you up do you? Maybe save that for later, eh? (FX: CHECKING SCANNER) No — scanner says the sky back there’s so full of plasma-fire we'd fry soon as we turn around. Nip through a full-scale space- battle? No, ta — I’1ll take the asteroids, fanks very much.\nWILL: But I have to get back to my friends. We only came here looking for him. The man in the cage. Dr Schalk. I take it you do know there’s a sedated human being in there?\nZIV: (BUSY STEERING) Yeah... Funny that. Wondered why Mr G brought him along. Not like he even matches his write-up in the brochure or anyfink. Not exactly sedated either. Another fake, I guess.\nWILL: What do you mean? Another fake? (ALARMED) Ziv! Watch out for that-\nZIV: Meteor? (BEAT) Hush now, babes. I’m tryin’ to drive...\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 62\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 29: INT. SONTARAN COMMAND VESSEL — BRIDGE\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: EXTERNAL LASERS AND EXPLOSIONS, SPACE BATTLE BETWEEN SONTARANS AND KRELLORANS )\nKLEIN: You’re outnumbered. Hopelessly outnumbered.\nSTENN: (ENJOYING HIMSELF) How soon you abandon hope! Little wonder your world lies destroyed.\nKLEIN: Destroyed? What do you mean? Earth is still- (BREAKS OFF) Oh.\nSTENN: Terran. I knew it. The scans were correct.\nKLEIN: What scans?\nSTENN: You say we are outnumbered. Did you never hear the Sontar Saying: the greater the odds, the greater the glory! This is what we were bred for.\nGREDD: It’s Major Vlaar, Marshal.\nSTENN: Go ahead, Major.\nVLAAR: (D) We’ve eliminated half the Krelloran fighters. Twenty-two remain with four attack-freighters and the leadship.\nSTENN: Good. Take four spheres around the leadship. To the other side of that moon. You remember... the Vanoonian gambit?\nVLAAR: (D) Aye Marshal. The Vanoonian gambit. (CHUCKLES) An excellent strategy.\nKLEIN: What are you doing? The main force is straight ahead.\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 63\nSTENN: I suspected your Zebrednik name was a disguise... You are an infiltrator. A Terran. But... are you a military officer?\nKLEIN: Not exactly. I have some military connections.\nSTENN: Are females of your world allowed such privileges?\nKLEIN: The ‘females of my world’ are more privileged than you in many ways.\nSTENN: (SNORT OF DERISION) A primitive society. Where the egg-bearer still has a role. We have eliminated that weakness.\nKLEIN: I wouldn’t say it was a weakness.\nSTENN: Ah. Have you reproduced?\nKLEIN: Erm. No... But I-\nSTENN: (OVER HER) Then your opinion is invalid. Gredd. You know the target. Fire at will.\nGREDD: Yes, Marshal. Fire!\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 64\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 30: INT. GARUNDEL’S PODCRAFT\nGARUNDEL: There we go. Leaving the atmosphere. Can’t say I’m sad to see the back of that rock. Ooh. That way’s a no-no. Too much... shooty-stuff.\nDOCTOR: You said my friend Dr Klein was on that Sontaran Command Vessel.\nGARUNDEL: (FX: FLICKING SWITCHES) First things first Doc. I’ve made a few upgrades. You recognise the old place?\nDOCTOR: Only too well. You found your way back to your ‘mothers’ ship?\nGARUNDEL: Eventually. The long way back. Things had changed. I missed out on my birthright. It’s no fun when sixty siblings kick you out.\nDOCTOR: Perhaps not. But probably no more than you deserved.\nGARUNDEL: I realised I work best on my own. (TO SELF) Should have remembered that. (TO DOCTOR) So I made a few modifications to my little podcraft. Extended the range to interstellar.\nDOCTOR: (FX: PRESSING BUTTONS) Yes... these drive systems. A hyper-star core. And warp shielding too.\nGARUNDEL: I know some guys. Who know some guys. Who are missing their hyper-star core and warp shielding.\nDOCTOR: (FIDDLING WITH SYSTEMS) Very impressive. You installed it... so why do you need me?\nGARUNDEL: Look at you, poking and prodding away. Just as I expected. You know these drive systems. I’m guessing you’1ll have some tricks up your sleeve to speed us along.\nDOCTOR: I might be able to give them a boost. Yes.\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 65\nGARUNDEL: That sonic gizmo of yours. How much you want for it?\nDOCTOR: (WORKING WITH SONIC) It’s not for sale.\nGARUNDEL: Oh. I’m forgetting. I’1ll just pluck it from your cold dead hand.\nDOCTOR: You know how to drive a bargain, Garundel.\nGARUNDEL: I need you to keep doing what you’re doing. ‘Specially if we’re gonna beat the Sontarans to the chase.\nDOCTOR: I want to find my friends. That’s all.\nGARUNDEL: (MOCKING) ‘You want..’? Way I see it. You don’t have a choice.\nDOCTOR: There’s always a choice...\nGARUNDEL: So how are the new recruits working out? The ice queen and the test-tube kid. Warlord of Zebrednik? Ha! That boy ain’t seen the outside of a science lab in months.\nDOCTOR: You knew they were with me?\nGARUNDEL: Thing about my comms shield blindspot. Gives me a nice clear channel to listen in on everyone using it.\nDOCTOR: I should have realised... (FX: FINISHES WORKING, CLOSES HATCH) There. I’ve looped the drive output so you’ve the equivalent of six hyper-stars.\nGARUNDEL: (FX: ENGINE PITCH RISES) Ooooh. And six times the speed. I knew you’d come through, Doc. Now get over there.\nDOCTOR: I thought you didn’t need the blaster to persuade me?\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 66\nGARUNDEL: Just makin’ sure. So. Why the newbies? What happened to all your old pals? The sisters with the guns, and that nurse fella with the funny voice?\nDOCTOR: Things... happened. (BEAT) Such a long time ago now.\nGARUNDEL: But you gotta move on. Like me, you don’t let the swamp-grass grow.\nDOCTOR: I am not remotely like you.\nGARUNDEL: Course you are. You’re a control freak. You’re a planner. Nothing wrong with that. Me too. First principles... Assume everyone else is an idiot.\nDOCTOR: I think I have a higher regard for my companions.\nGARUNDEL: But you can’t rely on anyone else to get the job done. Take that hypership of mine. Made for a quick getaway. But like I said, I don’t trust easily. So just in case it wasn’t me getting away... I gave myself remote control.\nDOCTOR: You mean...?\nGARUNDEL: (FX: FLICKING SWITCHES) Now we’re in range, I can switch the engines off. From here.\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 67\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 31: INT. HYPERSHIP (WEAPON STORE)\nWILL: So you’re a thief. And Garundel’s a conman. You’re both... thieves and conmen. Con... women.\nZIV: Con artist, babe.\nWILL: Art? Where’s the art in lying to people to get what you want?\nZIV: Just gotta be a big enough lie I guess. We were gonna make a fortune. All the weapons. The strongbox with the takings from our cash buyers. Not to mention the credit account where everyone paid their deposits. Only... I was never good at sharing. I’ve a fake I.D. I’ve Garundel’s signature down pat. If I can reach a branch of Galactic Creditbank before he does, I can make a withdrawal. A big withdrawal.\nWILL: So it’s all about money. I’d rather hoped aliens might have a different set of priorities.\nZIV: Aw. Bless you and your noble little ideals. Look. I‘m not out to hurt anyone. We’re nearly at Sirius Nine. It’s an A-rated exchange-world. I’1l nip to the bank, then I’1l let you go. If you like, you can take this Schalk fella with you.\nWILL: And the Doctor’s transport, of course.\nZIV: (NO-NONSENSE) You’re cute. But no-one’s that cute. A girl can be too generous...\nWILL: How do you know Garundel won’t get to.. Sirius Nine first?\nZIV: Because this ship is the fastest thing in the twelve systems, and I can fly it like- (FX: ENGINES DIE) Oh.\nWILL: That didn’t sound good.\nZIV: (FX: FLICKING DEAD SWITCHES) It’s not.\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 68\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 32: INT. SONTARAN COMMAND VESSEL — BRIDGE\nSTENN: Maintain fire, Sergeant. Almost complete.\nGREDD: Incoming missiles.\nGREDD: Hull integrity at 60 per cent, sir.\nKLEIN: What do you think you’re doing? We’re about to be blown to pieces. Shouldn’t your people be firing at their ships? What’s the point of wasting your energy on that moon!\nSTENN: You say you are not military. Yet you cast yourself as a general! You know nothing, Terran.\nSTENN: There! The moon is destroyed! Major Vlaar! Lead the spheres through the debris.\nKLEIN: What are they doing?\nSTENN: The Krellorships are big and clumsy. And now they are blind as well. Their sensors see only the rubble from the moon. Boulders and rocks.\nKLEIN: Your spheres — they’re practically the same shape. And size!\nSTENN: And now we know their weakness. See. They turn from the flotsam. The sensor panels on the port bows. Those are the Krellorans’ weak point!\nKLEIN: (MARVELLING) Disguise your own ships while exposing your opponent’s Achilles’ heel. Remarkable. You do know what you’re doing after all...\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 69\nSTENN: The Vanoonian gambit. Now you have learned something, Terran. (BEAT) Klineforth. If that is your name.\nKLEIN: It’s Klein. Dr Elizabeth Klein.\nSTENN: Well, Dr Elizabeth Klein. Watch and envy our prowess. See how the Sontaran Empire wages war!\nGREDD: Marshal. We have contact. Major Vlaar.\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 33: INT.

Weapons cannot lock. Weapons are disabled. They have targeted our sensor arrays...\nBENARRA: How can six spheres and a command ship take down a fleet of forty Krellor Battleships? How can they do this?\nASALLIS: Because they are... Sontarans...\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 72\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 35: INT. HYPERSHIP (WEAPON STORE)\nZIV: I spy with my little eye.. Something beginning with H.\nWILL: You do have an unfair advantage. I don’t know what most of these things are. Besides. There must be something more useful we could do. To get moving again.\nZIV: Stop changing the subject. You lost. H is for Human! Your turn.\nWILL: Look, um, I hope you don’t mind me asking, but... what are you? You’re not human, I mean.\nZIV: What gave it away? Don’t tell me. The hair? Or was it the blue skin and antennae? I’m Gadalaxian. (SAUCY) Most of the rest is the same. Never know. You might find out.\nWILL: Sorry, but if a girl kidnaps me, Gadalaxian or not, she doesn’t tend to get a second date.\nZIV: Who are you kidding, tiger? Doesn’t strike me you get that many first dates.\nWILL: (STAMMERING) Wh- wh- what makes you think that?\nZIV: No offence, ‘Will-valar’. But I’d bet you’ve met more aliens than girls.\nWILL: The name’s Arrowsmith. Will Arrowsmith. (BEAT) And I don’t get that much free time... Actually I’ve met twenty-three distinct alien species. In the line of my field work with a top secret military intelligence agency.\nZIV: Shuuut uuup! You? You’re a soldier?\nWILL: Yes. Well. No. Not exactly. Scientific advisor. (BEAT) Scientific advisor’s assistant. (BEAT) Probationary.\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 73\nZIV: I knew you wasn’t a soldier. On account of you holding your gun at the wrong end.\nWILL: Yes. Well. That was supposed to be a disguise.\nZIV: So. I’m not the only one who tells lies for a living.\nWILL: Do you.. want to have another go at the starter cylinders? I think I’ve worked out how they fire the engine arrays.\nZIV: And I’m dead impressed that you did, babe... but no. The override’s automatic. We’d need to stop the signal at source. Which since we can’t move... is totes impossible.\nWILL: I think I understand. Even if we got the engines started again. The override signal would just cut them out.\nZIV: You are paying attention, aincha? Yeah. Best sit it out. We’re near the space lanes. There’s plenty of air. We’ll get a lift to port eventually. Look. Long range scanner says someone’s on their way.\nWILL: Aren’t you worried it might be your boss?\nZIV: Nah. His bucket of bolts couldn’t make it this far this quick. Most likely a mini-freighter. Cargo for Sirius. I’1l flutter my antennae. Get us a tow.\nWILL: I must say. You’re being very philosophical about the whole thing.\nZIV: Some you win.. Some you lose. There’s always another sucker...\nWILL: You could... come along with us, you know.\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 74\nZIV: Who’s asking who on a date now?\nWILL: Why not consider it?\nZIV: Quite some brain on you, Will Arrowsmith. Sure you wouldn’t want to come with me?\nWILL: I just want to get Schalk to the Doctor. That’s all I can think of for now.\nZIV: If he even is Schalk.\nWILL: What? (BEAT) Yes... Of course. You mentioned it before. You said he was fake.\nZIV: Yeah. We got Kurt Schalk’s DNA profile in the brochure. But... I scraped a sample when I was prepping the vid. And... nope. Doesn’t even match.\nWILL: Hold on... If Kurt Schalk’s not in that cage... Who is?\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 75\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 36: INT. SONTARAN COMMAND VESSEL, BRIDGE\nSTENN: Ah. The glorious sight of an enemy defeated. The bodies. Twisting in space. I’d like to stay longer. Watch their death throes. But no. The mission calls us away.\nKLEIN: It’s.. unbelievable. You managed to win. Against that. Against all of that.\nSTENN: You are impressed, Terran? Dr... Klein?\nKLEIN: Impressed isn’t the word... Stunned. And your Major Vlaar. He sacrificed himself. I thought you said Sontarans had no word for suicide.\nSTENN: His was a glorious death. Well-earned through our campaigns. He was nine years old. A good lifespan for a warrior.\nKLEIN: Tell me about your armies. The Krelloran called you clones.\nSTENN: You do not know of Sontarans?\nKLEIN: Only... a little. Imagine I don’t.\nSTENN: The army of Sontar is infinite. Billions upon billions of clones hatch each dawn on the brood-worlds. Wave upon wave of dedicated soldiers. All like Vlaar. All willing to give their life. In the service of their command.\nKLEIN: Incredible. What couldn’t be achieved with unlimited troops...?\nSTENN: That is our strength. Every soldier is expendable. And every soldier has but one thought. The glory of the Sontaran Empire. (BEAT) You are silent, Dr Klein?\nKLEIN: I was thinking. There’ve been conflicts throughout my world’s history, so many battles, where force of numbers would have swayed the balance.\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 76\nSTENN: You know the art of war? I did not think Terra had progressed above level C civilisation.\nKLEIN: Oh, we may not have the technology, but humanity’s no slouch when it comes to war, Marshal. I’d say we’re beyond the nursery now. Way beyond.\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 77\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 37: INT. GARUNDEL’S PODCRAFT\nGARUNDEL: No no no no no. None of your Time Lordy mind-games with me, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: I’m simply asking which is your stronger impulse, Garundel? What motivates you more? Your desire for profit? Or your instinct for self-preservation?\nGARUNDEL: Trick question. No fair.\nDOCTOR: That Persuasion Machine is not some parlour trick for duping your customers. Any number of alien powers would happily vaporise you to get their paws, claws and assorted tentacles on oe\nGARUNDEL: That’s what I’m banking on.\nDOCTOR: You’ve really no concern for the fate of anything beyond your own pockets?\nGARUNDEL: Don’t knock it. These are some swanky pockets. The jacket’s from Sirius Five. Like it? I’ve eight more back there. Only you won’t need one. On account of being dead.\nDOCTOR: You need my help.\nGARUNDEL: Hey. I’m not stupid. I’m making one last score then out. Besides, Persuasion-lite doesn’t really do what your alien powers want it to.\nDOCTOR: But you have its inventor. I’m surprised you haven’t used him to perfect it already.\nGARUNDEL: Don’t think I didn’t try... But he kept his secrets. However far I dug.\nDOCTOR: What do you mean?\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 78\nGARUNDEL: Schalk pleaded ignorance. So I knocked him out and tried the direct approach. Deep-dive brain-probes.\nDOCTOR: That’s inhuman.\nGARUNDEL: Thanks. But he didn’t feel a thing. Or if he did, he’1ll never remember...\nDOCTOR: But you found nothing.\nGARUNDEL: The contents of his mind. All on this data tablet. Here. (HANDS IT TO DOCTOR) Take a look. Nothing... Nothing beyond the blueprints I already had. The rudimentary ideas... but not the finished article. And as for those dreams...\nDOCTOR: (FX: DOCTOR OPERATES DATA TABLET) Let me see...\nGARUNDEL: Knock yourself out. If you soup up Persuasion-lite like you did\nGARUNDEL: my engines, then maybe you’1ll live to see your next life, Doc.\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 79\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 38: INT. SONTARAN COMMAND VESSEL, BRIDGE\nSTENN: Report, Sergeant.\nGREDD: Target stationary, Marshal. We’ve reached the Sirius system.\nSTENN: Good. A true Sontaran never lets his cannons cool.\nKLEIN: This mission of yours. Is that why you were at the arms sale?\nSTENN: I do not share my plans with aliens. However... amusing you may be.\nKLEIN: Subterfuge isn’t your style. When you saved me from Benarra, you said I didn’t know I was in a fight. Wasn’t that the case for Garundel when you attacked his dome?\nSTENN: I announced our presence. I made our intent clear. Admittedly, these are not the usual form of orders...\nKLEIN: But you obeyed them anyway?\nSTENN: (ANNOYED) I follow my orders because I respect the chain of command.\nKLEIN: Ah. The soldier’s mantra the galaxy over.\nSTENN: The Generals of High Command are where they are because of past glories. Past victories. They do what is best for Sontar.\nKLEIN: Of course. It’s all someone else’s responsibility, isn’t it?\nSTENN: I do not wish to hear your opinions, Dr Klein. Only your history. Tell me more of this Kaiser Wilhelm.\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 80\nGREDD: Marshal. We have contact.\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 81\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 39: INT. HYPERSHIP (WEAPON STORE)\nZIV: So. This big blue box. What’s the story?\nWILL: It’s the Doctor’s. His Ship. I mean... I call it a Ship, but it’s so much more. It’s amazing. I’ve barely scratched the surface...\nZIV: Boys and their toys eh? (WALKING ROUND TARDIS) Looks like a cupboard. Basic transmat device. Seen ‘em before. Usually fetch a few thousand, depending on range. Never this colour. Or with these markings... What’s that say..? ‘Police?’\nWILL: Oh it’s so much more than a transmat. The interior exists in 4a... another dimension.\nZIV: Say what?\nWILL: It’s.. dimensionally transcendental.\nZIV: Oh. Now I’m interested. That’s gonna add a few zeroes to the price.\nZIV: (FX: RATTLING TARDIS DOORS) Locked. OK. Let us in then.\nWILL: I.. don’t have a key. The Doctor does.\nZIV: Hmmm. Say we could get in. Tell me... This TARDIS of yours... What can it do?\nWILL: Go absolutely anywhere in time and space.\nZIV: Wow. (BEAT) I always did want to travel. Meet new people.\nWILL: I’m actually from Earth. I was born in the twentieth century.\nZIV: Get away! (LAUGHS) Dunno if that makes you the sugar daddy or me the cradle snatcher... Twentieth Century Earth...?\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 82\nWILL: I’m sure... if you wanted... I could always... ask the Doctor...\nZIV: Somehow I don’t think he’d want little old me tagging along. No. I know where I belong. I’m used to working with the likes of Garundel. Going along with them. Then stinging them for as much as I can when the time’s right. Cos that way, nobody gets hurt. Nobody who matters anyway.\nWILL: You must reach a point when you’ve earned enough...\nZIV: You’d think so, wouldn’t you? But there’s always a slinkier jumpsuit, always more sequins... Always a new coiffure artiste to try. I’ve stayed in every ten-star orbital hotel in the twelve systems. Room-service and Gadalaxian champagne. You should try it some time.\nWILL: I think you’ve just got used to the lifestyle.\nZIV: It’s not all about me.. I send credits home. You might not believe it, but I’m looking after my old Auntie back on Gadalax Major. Not got long left now... But I’ll see to it she goes out in style.\nWILL: I see. So, you’re like... Robin Hood?\nZIV: Robin who? (BEAT) Why settle for daylight robbery, Auntie Vezza always says, if you can get away with starlight robbery? (BEAT) Nah, I dunno what it means either. Talks a load of old nonsense, Auntie Vezza.\nWILL: Come with us, Ziv. You never know what might happen.\nZIV: Uh-oh. We’re back online. Look.\nWILL: It’s another ship. We’re saved. (BEAT)\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 83\nZIV: (AT CONTROLS) How did he...?\nWILL: Ziv.. what’s wrong?\nZIV: It’s Garundel. And I don’t think he’s here to give me a promotion...\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 84\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 40: INT. SONTARAN COMMAND VESSEL, BRIDGE\nGREDD: Intercept course, Marshal.\nKLEIN: I’ve a question, Stenn. Don’t worry. It’s not about your precious orders.\nSTENN: You may ask it. Once you answer mine.\nKLEIN: Go on.\nSTENN: Why were you at the arms sale?\nKLEIN: For Schalk. We were only interested in Dr Kurt Schalk.\nSTENN: Of course. You come to claim your own. Your kinsman. Go ahead. Your question.\nKLEIN: Why am I still alive?\nSTENN: You have seen already, Dr Klein. I do nothing without strategic purpose. Therefore there is a reason.\nKLEIN: So what am I? A hostage? A bargaining chip? I should tell you now — I’ve nothing to do with this Garundel. The people who took your weapons.\nSTENN: If I’d had reason for you to know, then I would have told you. My own question has just provided an answer. If you have not worked it out, I need not tell you.\nKLEIN: What are you talking about? (SOTTO) You’re worse than the Doctor.\nSTENN: Be silent now.\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 85\nGREDD: Hypership in range, sir. The vessel is shielded. Lifesigns... unreadable.\nSTENN: Open a channel, Sergeant.\nGREDD: Aye sir.\nGREDD: Marshal... There is... another craft approaching.\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 86\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 41: INT. GARUNDEL’S PODCRAFT\nGARUNDEL: Gotcha. Come to momma. My little hypership.\nDOCTOR: Remote control...\nGARUNDEL: Told ya. I thought of everything. So what’s the verdict on Schalk’s brain?\nDOCTOR: You were right. Nothing useful in this data tablet. (SOTTO) Not to you...\nGARUNDEL: In that case, I think this beautiful friendship has run its course.\nDOCTOR: I can’t say I’m disappointed.\nGARUNDEL: Oh but you should be. It’s gonna be a very short reunion for you and the boy blunder. We’re getting my loot back. I’m taking your TARDIS. Then I’m killing you both. But maybe not in that order.\nDOCTOR: An admirably succinct plan. But you might not get the chance to carry it out. We are not alone.\nGARUNDEL: Proximity alarm...\nDOCTOR: Check your starboard scanners, Garundel. Sontarans.\nSTENN: (D) Attention. All aliens. This is Marshal Stenn of the Six- Twentieth Sontaran Attack Fleet. Hold your positions.\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 87\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 42: INT. SONTARAN COMMAND VESSEL, BRIDGE\nSTENN: (ALOUD TO COMM) Repeat. Do not move. The hypership is claimed by the Sontaran Empire. It contains property of an Imperial Attack Fleet. As such it is now a legitimate asset of that fleet. Any attempt to interfere with military business will be deemed an act of aggression against the Sontaran Empire and dealt with accordingly.\nGARUNDEL: (VIA COMMS) Marshal Stenn. Old buddy. Surely we can come to some arrangement. There’s my property in there too.\nDOCTOR: (VIA COMMS) Listen to me, Stenn. This situation has ramifications far beyond your petty war. I demand that all non- combatants be allowed to leave the vessel first.\nKLEIN: (CALLING) Doctor! Is that you? Will’s on that other ship!\nDOCTOR: (D) Elizabeth! You’re alive! Yes, I know.\nSTENN: The... Doctor? The.. Time Lord known as the Doctor?\nGREDD: Scans confirm Gallifreyan occupant in podcraft.\nDOCTOR: (D) Please, explain to the Marshal we need to-\nKLEIN: Aren’t you even going to listen?\nSTENN: I have already stated my intent. They have not complied.\nKLEIN: That’s it? Shoot first and ask questions later?\nSTENN: It is a most efficient policy. One can usually dispense with the questions that way. Gredd — target the Urodelian podcraft.\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 88\nKLEIN: But... the Doctor’s in there!\nSTENN: I remind you, Dr Klein. You are a prisoner of the Sontaran Empire. One more word and I shall remove your tongue. (TO GREDD) Take aim, Sergeant.\nGREDD: Podcraft in range. Missile ready.\nSTENN: This will be a Grag-diamond shot.

With one Meson torpedo. Fire!\nKLEIN: No, you mustn’t!\nSTENN: First the victory against Krellor and now this. Today... is a\nSTENN: very good day indeed. But not for the Doctor.\nSTENN: SCENE 43: INT. HYPERSHIP (WEAPON STORE)\nWILL: He was there... The Doctor was there. And now he’s... dead.\nZIV: That was close. (NOTICING) Hey. Our shields are down.\nDOCTOR: (MATERIALISING) Yes. A little too close.\nGARUNDEL: (MATERIALISING) Way too close.\nWILL: Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Mr Arrowsmith. You seem to be well.\nGARUNDEL: And Miss Ziv. (TUTS) Have I got a severance package for you.\nZIV: Aw, no. Mr G, please —\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 90\nDOCTOR: Garundel. We’re currently in the sights of a Sontaran battleship. I suggest we set aside our differences. And put the forcefields back up.\nGARUNDEL: Good point.\nWILL: How did you...? What are those little rods?\nDOCTOR: Urodelian teleport receivers. We lowered your shields remotely so we could lock on. Now the transmitter’s destroyed, they’re useless.\nGARUNDEL: Let me check on my loot. (GOING ACROSS SHIP) You got five minutes to get us out of this, Doc. Remember who’s holding the blaster.\nWILL: I’m so pleased to see you. Doctor. This is Ziv.\nZIV: Er... hiya...\nDOCTOR: You’re not going to shoot me again, are you?\nZIV: Sorry about that. I was only aiming at your shoes, you know.\nDOCTOR: (POINTED) I like my shoes.\nWILL: She won’t do it again. She’s actually quite nice once you get to know her.\nGARUNDEL: (ACROSS SHIP) Sure she is... Right up until the moment she steals your living out from under your gills. Oh look. A TARDTS...\nDOCTOR: Leave it alone, Garundel.\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 91\nGARUNDEL: (FX: RUMMAGING THROUGH CRATE) Sure I got just the thing for your little box of tricks right here... ah ha! Sontaran Gravity clamp!\nDOCTOR: I said. Leave it alone.\nGARUNDEL: Too late! Segrian gravity clamp across the doors. Your ship’s locked down. With my palm-print no less. (STEELY) Nobody takes anything else without my say-so.\nSTENN: (VIA COM) Attention, hypership. You see the fate of those who defy the Six-Twentieth. Confirm your surrender.\nGARUNDEL: Surrender? I got enough firepower here to atomise that ship.\nDOCTOR: You'd have to drop the shields to use it. You wouldn’t reach the trigger. Marshal Stenn believes you and I have been disintegrated. (BEAT) It may be to our strategic advantage to remain dead.\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL)\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 44: INT.

You killed the Doctor...\nSTENN: I have warned you once, Klein.\nGREDD: They are responding, Marshal.\nSTENN: They have no choice. (TO COMMS) Speak, alien!\nZIV: Page 92\nZIV: (D) Ahem. Marshal Stenn. Hiya. How’s you? Dunno if you remember\nZIV: me-\nWILL: (D, OFF) Ask about Dr Klein.\nZIV: (D) Shush babes. I’m getting to it.\nSTENN: You surrender your ship?\nZIV: (D) So, Marshal. Thing is. We have something you want. And you\nZIV: have something. Someone... we want. How about we make\nCROSS TO: a deal?\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 93\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 45: INT. HYPERSHIP\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) An exchange.\nWILL: (ALOUD, TO COMMS) We’d like to propose an exchange. We’1ll give you the Earth scientist. For my commanding officer. Ms Klein. We’ve no quarrel with the mighty Sontar Empire.\nZIV: (TO COMMS) We’re happy to return your property too. Maybe one or two extras? Can’t say fairer than that.\nSTENN: (D) All the weapons. We will take all the weapons. Along with Schalk and his Persuasion Machine.\nGARUNDEL: (ANGRY WHISPER) No way. No way are those boulder-headed morons taking my-\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) Shhh!\nSTENN: (D) What was that?\nZIV: (TO COMMS) Just... considering your generous offer.\nWILL: (SOTTO) We’ve got to do it. We don’t have a choice.\nSTENN: (D) I am waiting.\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) Go ahead, Will.\nWILL: (TO COMMS) The answer’s yes. You can have everything. Just send\nWILL: back my... friend.\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 94\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 46: INT. SONTARAN COMMAND VESSEL, BRIDGE\nSTENN: So. You are of value to these people.\nKLEIN: Yes. It seems that I am.\nSTENN: You do well to inspire such loyalty in your subordinate.\nKLEIN: I’m his only friend out here now.\nSTENN: Sergeant Gredd. Tether a transporter crate to the hold and direct it over to the hypership.\nGREDD: Why do we not blast it from space, Marshal? Send a boarding party?\nSTENN: Do not question my orders! I follow High Command’s directive. There are items of great value aboard that vessel. They must not be damaged. We must secure the prototype Persuasion Machine and the human scientist. And I want my swagger-stick.\nGREDD: (LEAVING) As you command, sir.\nSTENN: (TO COMMS) Attention hypership. A storage crate is coming. Fill at;\nWILL: (D) Thank you. (ASIDE, OFF MIC) Yes, yes, I’m asking him now. (TO MIC) Can you confirm Dr Klein is unharmed?\nSTENN: She can confirm it herself. (TO KLEIN) You may speak.\nKLEIN: (CALLING) Will. I’m safe. I’m.. sorry. About the Doctor. Don’t worry. I’ll get us home... somehow.\nWILL: (D) Yes ma’am. I’m sure you will, ma’am. Marshal. Will you send Dr Klein in the container?\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 95\nSTENN: Request denied. I won’t be deprived of her company just yet. It is most... illuminating. Do not antagonise me, and you may escape with your lives. Send your cargo. If I’m satisfied, Klein can be exchanged for her clansman. The genetic connection is intriguing... but once we have Schalk, it will be irrelevant.\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 96\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 47: INT. HYPERSHIP\nWILL: Confirmed. (BEAT) What do you mean? ‘Clansman’?\nWILL: Doctor— You’ve cut them off?\nDOCTOR: That’s enough small-talk for a Sontaran. He doesn’t want to be antagonised, remember.\nGARUNDEL: Small-talk. Sontaran. Funny.\nWILL: What did he mean? What genetic connection? I mean, Schalk and Dr Klein are both human...\nDOCTOR: From a Sontaran perspective that’s close enough.\nWILL: But he called them ‘clansmen’. It’s like he thinks they’re related...\nDOCTOR: Sontarans have their own ideas about clans. Many humans share a Similar lineage. Most West Europeans are at least two percent Neanderthal, you know. I’d be very surprised if Klein and Schalk didn’t have some DNA in common...\nZIV: Depends which Schalk you’re talking about. The one in the brochure. Or the one in the cage.\nDOCTOR: Say that again, young lady?\nZIV: (FX: OPENING CAGE) The DNA profile in the catalogue. I guess we had to include it ‘cos everyone would have done their research. But this guy’s just some random stand-in.\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 97\nDOCTOR: Oh I doubt very much it’s random... Will, take off his hood. Garundel, care to explain?\nGARUNDEL: Details. Turquoise traitor’s right. That DNA profile is the real Schalk. I thought this was the guy. Don’t ask me why they don’t match. No biggie. Plan was: hand him over, then vamoose. Anyway, as you can see...\nWILL: Eeurgh.\nDOCTOR: He’s dead. Decomposing.\nWILL: Still looks like the man we met on Minos. Just. Kurt Schalk...\nDOCTOR: So it seems... And full of vivifying catalysts from the smell. Giving the appearance of life to any inquisitive scanners. I’m beginning to see the bigger picture.\nGARUNDEL: Well, whoop-di-do for you. Care to fill us in?\nDOCTOR: Perhaps when we’re not about to be atomised. ‘Persuasion-lite’. Tell me what it can do.\nGARUNDEL: Like I said. It’s got... limitations.\nZIV: Persuasion field’s only half a K. Hardly the planet-wide solution advertised. And it won’t work on anyone not willing to be persuaded. Which kind of defeats the whole purpose, really.\nGARUNDEL: But hey... buyer beware. It’s not like they’d ever return it to the store.\nZIV: Cos the store would be twenty thousand light years away, spendin’ all their money. (SIGH) It was a good plan Mr G..\nGARUNDEL: So good, you stole it yourself. Got nothing more to say to you Missy.\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 98\nDOCTOR: Be quiet. I’m trying to think...\nWILL: Doctor. Schalk’s dead, and the machine is useless.\nDOCTOR: On the contrary. It sounds precisely suited to our purpose. Now. Garundel. Why don’t you do something useful? Put down that blaster and open your machine.\nGARUNDEL: Ask Blue. She knows how it works.\nWILL: Would you mind, Ziv?\nZIV: (OPENING MACHINE) OK. You really think you can get the Sontarans off our back?\nDOCTOR: Undoubtedly... And we may not have to lose everything...\nGARUNDEL: So what you waiting for? Get that Time Lord brain in gear. Don’t mind me. I’ll just sit here and keep you all covered. I do like to watch craftsmen at work...\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 99\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 48: INT. SONTARAN COMMAND VESSEL, DOCKING BAY\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: CLUNKING BAY DOORS, SONTARANS HEAVING CHAINS, DRAGGING\nCONTAINER: IN)\nGREDD: (MUFFLED IN HELMET) Haul it in, Troopers. Steady now.\nGREDD: Mind the paintwork! Marshal Stenn will skin you alive if you take the insignia off his hull!\nGREDD: Seal the doors.\nGREDD: Forcefield down. Repressurising.\nGREDD: (REMOVING HELMET) Helmets off, Troopers. Open it up.\nGREDD: (TO COMMS) Cargo on board, Marshal.\nSTENN: (D) Good, Sergeant. Confirm contents.\nZIV: (OFF, IN CONTAINER) Hiya babes. Bit of a bumpy ride, eh? S’'alright, he don’t say much. Got everything you wanted right here.\nGREDD: The blue-skinned female has escorted the Terran aboard. He appears unconscious, bound and hooded. All armaments... present and correct. And the Persuasion Device.\nSTENN: (D) Unload that first, Sergeant, along with the hardware. I want a full inventory. The aliens can wait.\nGREDD: Aye Marshal.\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 100\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 49: INT. SONTARAN COMMAND VESSEL, BRIDGE\nSTENN: It appears your man’s as good as his word. (BEAT) Dr Elizabeth Klein. Under the seventy-eighth amendment to the Third Party code relating to prisoners of war, I grant you your freedom.\nKLEIN: You’re letting me go? Just like that?\nSTENN: You may enter the container once emptied and the contents verified.\nKLEIN: I’m really free to walk out of here? When you unfasten these straps, that is.\nSTENN: It is what was agreed.\nKLEIN: Thank you.\nSTENN: Thanks are unnecessary. A Sontaran without honour is no Sontaran.\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 101\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 50: INT. SONTARAN COMMAND VESSEL, DOCKING BAY\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: WEAPONS BEING UNLOADED FROM CONTAINER, SONTARANS STOMPING ABOUT)\nZIV: Careful. Dr Schalk fell over twice on the way here.\nGREDD: Why is he sedated?\nZIV: Don’t ask me. I didn’t wrap it. That’s how Mr Garundel had him. So, sweetie. Where’s Dr Klein?\nGREDD: Wait there.\nGREDD: This is the Persuasion Device?\nZIV: Yep. Don’t look like half a billion credits does it?\nGREDD: (CARRYING MACHINE OFF) I will bear this to the Marshal myself. Troopers. Bring the weapons. Follow.\nGREDD: (FX: SONTARANS MARCH OUT CARRYING WEAPONS, FOOTSTEPS ECHO DOWN CORRIDOR)\nZIV: (WHISPERS) They’ve gone.\nGARUNDEL: Let’s hope the Time Lord managed to ramp that Persuasion Machine to the max.\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 102\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 51: INT. HYPERSHIP\nDOCTOR: Hold that wire in place.. This is a very delicate procedure...\nWILL: Do you really think it will work, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: With your help, Will, I think we can do anything.\nWILL: I’m just doing what you told me.\nDOCTOR: Instinctive. Intuitive. When this is all over... I wonder...\nWILL: Wonder what?\nDOCTOR: (CHANGING SUBJECT) I’m hoping my distraction will buy us some time. The blanket persuasion field should be operational now...\nWILL: Let’s just hope it works on all of them.\nDOCTOR: The thing about Sontarans. They’re a military race. They obey orders. They want to be told what to do. And an army marches on its stomach. Or in their case, its collective probic vents.\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 103\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 52: INT. SONTARAN COMMAND VESSEL, BRIDGE\nSTENN: (RECORDED MESSAGE, VIA PA) All Sontaran troops. Report to the nourishment banks. Repeat. All personnel to recharge.\nSTENN: (TO KLEIN) This operation will continue once the plasma cycle is complete. Remain there, Dr Klein.\nKLEIN: I don’t have much of a choice! You were about to release me.\nSTENN: Nourishment is vital. To ready ourselves for the next conflict.\nKLEIN: Isn’t this rather an odd time for a lunchbreak?\nSTENN: I will return at full power to remove your restraints. (FX:\nOPERATES: CONTROLS) Bridge to automatic. Company dismissed.\nOPERATES: (FX: STENN STOMPS OFF, OTHER SONTARANS LEAVE THEIR POSTS,\nSTOMPING: RECEDES )\nKLEIN: (CALLING AFTER) How long will you be? Couldn’t you release me first? Hello? You can’t abandon ship in the middle of a... Situation... (CALLING) I thought you were a military genius!\nGARUNDEL: Anyone home?\nKLEIN: What the hell are you doing here?\nGARUNDEL: Rescuing you, Madam Frosty. If you’d rather, I could come back later.\nZIV: ‘Ello, Dr Klein. Let’s get you out of these restraints.\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 104\nKLEIN: But your ship.. I saw it destroyed...\nGARUNDEL: Don’t remind me. Fortunately, I wasn’t on it. Teleport.\nKLEIN: And the Doctor?\nGARUNDEL: His idea. Gotta give him credit for that.\nZIV: All done. This way, ma’am. Have you back in no time.\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 105\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 53: INT. SONTARAN COMMAND VESSEL, CORRIDOR\nZIV: Next up, bumpy ride in a transport crate. Not far though.\nGARUNDEL: (TRYING DOORS) Now where d’you think the sleeping uglies stashed my takings? And the Grag-diamonds... Every Sontaran Command Ship keeps Grag-diamonds aboard somewhere. (GOING OFF) How many storage bays they got on this thing?\nZIV: I was wondering, Dr Klein. About your... assistant. He said... you might have room on your Ship for one more.\nKLEIN: Will’s a good man. Means well. But we are rather occupied at the moment. I’m not sure-\nZIV: (INTERRUPTING) I wouldn’t be any trouble. Just... er, curious really.\nKLEIN: About the TARDIS or about my assistant?\nZIV: Bit of both, I suppose.\nGARUNDEL: (CALLING, OFF) Found the Fanerian blasters. Now I feel dressed again.\nKLEIN: Well. It’s not up to me. It’s the Doctor’s ship. Where is he anyway?\nGARUNDEL: (COMING BACK) Working on Plan B.. I think... (FX: FUZZY HUM OF\nPERSUASION: MACHINE, IN GARUNDEL’S HEAD) I... think...\nKLEIN: And you, Garundel. I’m surprised he managed to convince you to board a ship full of hostiles, unarmed. To free me at considerable risk to yourself.\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 106\nGARUNDEL: The way he explained it... it was... something to do with the diamonds...\nKLEIN: I’d got the impression you weren’t a great one for personal jeopardy.\nGARUNDEL: No. I’m not. I- I-\nZIV: Mr G?\nGARUNDEL: Oh no. No way I’d board a ship full of Sontarans who’ve already blown me up once.. Not unless.. He did this! He used my own damn Persuasion Machine on me!\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 107\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 54: INT. HYPERSHIP\nWILL: Ready?\nDOCTOR: Sontaran teleport technology... I’ve synchronised Garundel’s receiver. Still only one-way, I’m afraid.\nWILL: I understand. I’1ll use the magnetic field to haul you all back in the transport crate.\nDOCTOR: Poor Mr Schalk. Or should I say, Mr Hinterberger. Ending up as a lure for Garundel’s customers.\nWILL: Hinterberger? I don’t understand... We met Schalk on Minos. That was him.\nDOCTOR: Think about it, Will. You’ve created a hugely powerful and dangerous device, and you don’t quite understand how. Then you find every hostile power on Earth wants it. Not to mention the hostile powers not from Earth. What would you do?\nWILL: Run away, I suppose.\nDOCTOR: You could. But you’d still be you. You’d still be the person they’re looking for.\nWILL: Then you’d need... a disguise?\nDOCTOR: What better disguise than to persuade someone else they’re you? Then to persuade yourself, even, that you are them?\nWILL: Because if you don’t know you’re in disguise, how will anyone else...?!\nDOCTOR: I presume that Herr Doktor Schalk built a prototype back on\nDOCTOR: Earth. But, once he became the target of alien interest, he\nDOCTOR: became so scared that he persuaded Hinterberger here to swap places. Then he destroyed the machine.\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 108\nWILL: So if this Schalk was actually Hinterberger... we still need to find Schalk!\nDOCTOR: Yes. But let’s find Klein first.\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 109\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 55: INT. SONTARAN COMMAND VESSEL, CORRIDOR\nKLEIN: So we’re not going back to the Doctor now?\nGARUNDEL: (FUMING) Keep moving, Ice Queen. Change of plan. Got all my loot on a brand new jalopy. Sontaran Command Ship no less. I’1l blast that dratted hypership from the bridge.\nKLEIN: That’s not fair.\nGARUNDEL: Keep moving. Unless you want a load of Fanerian laser in your leather-cased behind.\nZIV: Can’t we just leave them, Mr G? Send them on their way?\nGARUNDEL: Oh yeah. Miss Ziv.. Second thoughts, stop right there. Both of you.\nZIV: I could... come along with you. Start a new con...\nGARUNDEL: (SLOW AND MENACING) I don’t think you understand, Blue. When I talk this slow, I am furious.\nZIV: (SCARED) Or... we just go our separate ways... You keep my share of the profits if you- (CRIES OUT)\nKLEIN: No!\nGARUNDEL: Don’t you worry girly-girl. I’m keeping everything. Re- investment in resources is required.\nKLEIN: Why don’t you put the gun down? As she says, we can all go our separate ways.\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 110\nGARUNDEL: Ain’t that the risk with taking on staff, Elizabeth? Never know what you’re gonna get. A loyal and trusted assistant. (BEAT) Or a scheming little minx.\nZIV: I said I’m sorry. Will asked me to go with him. You don’t ever have to see me again.\nGARUNDEL: Boy blunder took a shine to you, did he? Where d’you find that one, Klein? An open mind’s one thing, but one so open his brains fall out?\nZIV: He’s a clever boy. A nice boy. I never get to meet nice boys.\nGARUNDEL: Aw. Took a shine yourself, huh? Spin the line about the sick aunt? I checked that one out. She’s sick all right. In an asylum for the criminally insane.\nZIV: She’s innocent... It was a misunderstanding...\nGARUNDEL: Save the doe eyes, Blue. I know your act by heart. Felony runs in the family. You’re hustler through and through. Just like me. I’d such hopes...\nZIV: Mr Garundel. Please.\nKLEIN: Leave her alone.\nGARUNDEL: Like I said, that’s the trouble with staff... If it don’t work out.. Ah well. Can’t live with ‘em.. Can’t kill ‘em. (BEAT) Oh wait. (STEELY) Sure I can.\nKLEIN: No! (BEAT) Was that absolutely necessary?\nGARUNDEL: Absolutely. I will not be taken for a sucker.\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 111\nKLEIN: That’s it? Your pride’s been dented so that girl had to die?\nGARUNDEL: She ain’t the only one. Get going, frosty. Back to the bridge.\nGARUNDEL: I gotta make a call.\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 112\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 56: INT. SONTARAN COMMAND VESSEL, RECHARGE BAY\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: SONTARAN RECHARGE CONTROLS ACTIVATED, PERSUASION MACHINE HUM)\nDOCTOR: (WHISPER) Wakey-wakey, Marshal. Rise and shine.\nSTENN: (WAKING) Who...? — Doctor! How did you get aboard?\nDOCTOR: Once I realised your Command Vessel had a teleport hub, I just adapted Garundel’s receiver to the correct frequency. The one I used to escape his ship.\nDOCTOR: Ignore the machine, Marshal. It’s not important.\nSTENN: Why should I not eradicate you now, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Under the Fifteenth Treaty, non-combatants are exempt from Martial jurisdiction.\nSTENN: But you. You are the Doctor. Infamous enemy of the Sontarans.\nDOCTOR: But I am your prisoner.\nSTENN: What?\nDOCTOR: I’m alone on a Sontaran Command Ship. Unarmed. To all intents and purposes. How could I be anything else?\nSTENN: That is... reasonable...\nDOCTOR: And as your prisoner, I have a last request.\nSTENN: In certain circumstances, a prisoner’s final request may be granted. Go on.\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 113\nDOCTOR: There’s a matter of honour to be settled. And if there’s one thing Sontarans excel at.. (BEAT) I will keep for another time, Marshal.\nSTENN: I have my orders.\nDOCTOR: To secure Kurt Schalk. But Schalk... was not Schalk. Your computer confirms it. Look.\nSTENN: (COMING OVER) My battle-computer. How did you gain access...?\nDOCTOR: Oh... I’d twenty seconds to spare while you were waking up... (FX:\nCHATTERING: READOUT) On screen. A replay of your Major’s lifesign scan on Q-987. The delegates are here.\nSTENN: Including your agent. Klein.\nDOCTOR: And over there. (FX: CHATTERING PAUSED) When the shields come down.\nSTENN: The hidden hypership. The Gadalaxian. Two more humans.\nDOCTOR: My other ‘agent’. And Schalk. Only this doesn’t match the brochure. And he’s actually dead.\nSTENN: Let me see. (FX: COMPUTER CONTROLS) That is not the correct genetic profile.. But Dr Klein’s is. It is most perplexing.\nDOCTOR: We were being sold a lemon, Marshal. Or rather, a goose. A wild goose.\nSTENN: My orders do not allow for such a situation.\nDOCTOR: Consider it a golden opportunity to think for yourself.\nSTENN: Subterfuge is unnecessary, Doctor. I have released Klein.\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 114\nDOCTOR: Really? I’ve met Sontarans before. They couldn’t all be trusted. It appears I’ve misjudged you, Stenn. I apologise.\nSTENN: Apologies are also unnecessary.\nDOCTOR: And if that Gadalaxian body in the corridor is anything to go by, there’s a much more dangerous threat on this ship. (TO SELF) What have I done?\nSTENN: No Doctor. This is my ship. And I am dangerous.\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 115\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 57: INT. SONTARAN COMMAND VESSEL, BRIDGE\nKLEIN: You’re a monster, Garundel.\nGARUNDEL: Now she gets it. (FX: SIGNAL BEEPS) Stay there and keep schtum. I’m calling in the big guns. This game’s gone far enough. I’m taking my haul.\nKLEIN: You’re stealing the Sontaran fleet?\nGARUNDEL: Ships. Guns. Technology. Hey, I can even grind down the troopers for pet-food and sell off their boots.\nDOCTOR: (ENTERING, AT DOOR) So, Garundel. Your profit motive trumps your instinct for self-preservation after all.\nGARUNDEL: How’d you figure that, Doc?\nDOCTOR: Because otherwise, I wouldn’t have been able to persuade you to come here. Hello Elizabeth. We’re leaving.\nKLEIN: Doctor...\nGARUNDEL: Uh-uh-uh. Nobody goes nowhere without Garundel’s say-so.\nDOCTOR: Really? Somebody begs to differ.\nSTENN: (ENTERING) Urodelian. Now you face a Sontaran weapon.\nGARUNDEL: But you don’t have a weapon, Marshal. I, on the other hand...\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 116\nSTENN: Ha! Fanerian disruptor beam? I have faced this many times. Sontaran armour is more than a match. I do not need a weapon. I am a weapon.\nGARUNDEL: (PINNED DOWN) Stenn! Old buddy. Old pal. I’1l do you a deal on those planetary disintegrators...\nSTENN: I want nothing from you. But your slow, agonising and dishonourable death.\nGARUNDEL: (CHOKING) We're... all... out... of those!\nDOCTOR: Marshal. Please. Disarm Garundel. Give the gun to Dr Klein. We’re taking him with us.\nSTENN: No. His debt is to me, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: I need him to release my Ship. He has it locked-down.\nKLEIN: Marshal Stenn deserves his revenge. Just take the key.\nDOCTOR: Nobody deserves their revenge, Klein. There is no key.\nKLEIN: The release code, then. Whatever it is we need to free the TARDIS.\nDOCTOR: No. You don’t understand. It’s locked with Garundel’s hand- print.\nSTENN: Then you only need his hand.\nGARUNDEL: No... please, no...\nSTENN: My swagger-stick could make the cut cleanly. Painlessly. But it is not here. Because you stole it.\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 117\nGARUNDEL: (DESPERATE) I brought it back! It’s in the hold!\nSTENN: You ask me to disarm him, Doctor.

I’m impressed.\nWILL: What’s that, ma’am? Looks like a-\nKLEIN: Don’t ask.\nWILL: Oh. That’s rather unpleasant.\nKLEIN: There, Doctor. Your precious TARDIS is free.

(EXITS)\nDOCTOR: I don’t enjoy violence, Elizabeth. Whatever the provocation.\nKLEIN: You said yourself, Garundel’s hand will grow back in a month. We do what’s required, Doctor. To get the job done.\nWILL: Here we are.\nDOCTOR: Thank you Mr Arrowsmith. I knew we could rely on you.\nWILL: I just did what you told me. I should thank you, really. For your faith. In allowing me on such an important mission. (BEAT) Actually, I did want to ask... (BEAT) Where’s.. Ziv?\nDOCTOR: I’m. sorry. Will, she-\nKLEIN: (CUTTING ACROSS HIM) She decided to stay with her employer. Life on the open road was not for her after all.\nDOCTOR: Elizabeth, are you sure we shouldn’t-\nKLEIN: It’s for the best, Doctor. No point building up the boy’s hopes.\nWILL: Oh. That’s a pity. She seemed so genuine... on the ship.\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 120\nKLEIN: I’m sure she did. That was her vocation after all. Persuading others to believe her stories.\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 121\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 60: INT. SONTARAN COMMAND VESSEL, BRIDGE\nGARUNDEL: (BATTERED) That’s it.. I give in... Just finish me now...\nSTENN: No, Urodelian. I swore I would not kill you. You’ve not earned a warrior’s end. —\nSTENN: What was that?!?\nGARUNDEL: Now they get here...\nSTENN: What is this? Who is that on the outside of this ship?\nGARUNDEL: You’11 find out just as soon as they cut through the hull.\nSTENN: Awake, troopers! Awake! There’s a battle to be won!\nGARUNDEL: Hi gang. What kept ya?\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 122\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 61: INT. TARDIS, CONTROL ROOM\nKLEIN: So the machine’s inactive.\nDOCTOR: I certainly hope so.\nWILL: Dead. Like poor Schalk. I mean... Hinterberger.\nDOCTOR: Still, we should put it somewhere safe. The computer room. Will, would you mind? Down the corridor, second left, third on the right. Past the orangery. Don’t touch the box marked WOTAN.\nWILL: (FX: LIFTING MACHINE, UNSURE) Second left... Third right?\nDOCTOR: The TARDIS won’t let you get lost. She likes you.\nWILL: Yes. (GOING OFF) I think she does!\nKLEIN: Doctor. What about the real Schalk? Where do we start?\nDOCTOR: If I’m right, back on Earth. Where we should have looked in the first place. (BEAT) Elizabeth. Shouldn’t Will know the truth? About his friend?\nKLEIN: Persuading people to believe stories. I thought that was your forte. (GETTING ANGRY) Were you ever going to tell me? The DNA- link between Schalk and myself? Am I important to you? Or is it just my genes you’re interested in? Is that why you came back to UNIT?\nDOCTOR: No, not at all...\nKLEIN: Am I just another tool? Another sonic screwdriver? Something to get the job done?\nDOCTOR: It’s not like that! (BEAT) Elizabeth. I’m afraid that Schalk might be... a relative of yours.\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 123\nKLEIN: Then let’s go and say hello.\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 124\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 62: INT. GARUNDEL’S ALLIES’ SHIP\nGARUNDEL: Three, two, one and —\nGARUNDEL: Look at the pretty patterns. Say goodbye to the Six-Twentieth’s capsules, Marshal. (WINCES) Almost makes up for the hand.\nSTENN: (BEATEN, NEAR DEATH) Every dead Sontaran is worth ten million of you.\nGARUNDEL: Shush you. You’ve no idea what I’m worth. Lying there in your restraints.\nSTENN: This... is a dishonour. I should have died in battle.\nGARUNDEL: Don’t worry. My business partners’1l be along to finish the job soon enough. I did consider selling the capsules, but I already stripped out everything of value. Ready to roll in my very own top-of-the-range Sontaran Command Ship. Only minimal battle damage. Garundel Galactic’s movin’ up in the cosmos.\nSTENN: These creatures... Your ‘partners’.. They cannot be trusted.\nGARUNDEL: Hey. They’ve done right by me so far... Even got me a regen pod to grow back this mitt. (CALLING) All set, guys. The Doctor’s all of a dither. Hope you located your goods in his absence.\nSTENN: This was planned? A... distraction? For the Doctor?\nGARUNDEL: Yeah, so my partners could swipe the real Schalk from Earth, unnoticed. You little clones are... collateral damage.\nSTENN: I do not fear death. If an officer’s heart beats half a billion times, he has failed in his duty. If I have swayed the balance\nSTENN: of the war a fraction of a degree toward Sontar, my life is not wasted.\nDOCTOR WHO: STARLIGHT ROBBERY (FINAL) Page 125\nGARUNDEL: Ooooh. You’ve no idea.. The plans these guys have. Makes your Spat with the Rutans look like a backyard hoo-ha. (FX: 3 x\nALLIES: ROLL IN FROM OFF) Speak of the devil. Here they come!\nSTENN: (GOING OFF AS WE FOLLOW GARUNDEL LEAVING THE ROOM) Get away from me, you metal horrors!\nGARUNDEL: (AT HATCH, CALLING TO ALLIES) Pleasure working with you, fellas. You ever need me again... (CLOSE) Just stick out a sucker.\nSTENN: (OFF) No! No! You can kill me. But you will never defeat the mighty Sontaran Empire. I feel my three hundred millionth heartbeat... Sontar! Sontar! I die for Son-\nGARUNDEL: Nothing personal, Stenn. Strictly business.\nGARUNDEL: THE END"
