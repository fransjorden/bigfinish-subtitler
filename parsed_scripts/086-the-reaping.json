Oh, hi, Mrs Van Gysengham. You're looking jazzy today. That colour really suits you.\nMRS VAN G: Your daughter, Mrs Foster.\nPERI: Suit yourself. Hi Mom.\nJANINE: Morning. Did you hear about the Russians?\nPERI: Yeah. Oh, you know, sometimes the whole world just seems so small and petty.\nJANINE: A bit profound for before breakfast, darling.\nPERI: Yeah, well. Anyway, I’m here to tell you that er, I won’t be coming today.\nMRS VAN G: Surprise, surprise.\nJANINE: Oh, Peri, why not?\nPERI: I guess I’m just not in a real cave mood right now. I wouldn’t want to cramp your style.\nMRS VAN G: I’m sure we'll get on perfectly well without you.\nJANINE: Well, what are you going to do instead? You can’t mope around the hotel all day.\nPERI: Oh, you know me, I'll think of something.\nJANINE: Are you all right?\nPERI: No, no, it’s fine. Seriously. Lanzarote’s great, and the hotel’s great, and Mrs Van Gysengham here is just fantastic.\nMRS VAN G: Ha.\nPERI: But I just wanna, oh, I don’t know, explore.\nJANINE: Well, be careful.\nPERI: I will. Anyway, where’s my dearest step-father?\nJANINE: Oh, you know Howard. He’ll be out on his boat searching for\nJANINE: + PERI: the buried treasures of the deep.\nPERI: Okay. Well, I’ll go and see him first. I, er, Mom? I'll er, I'll see you later.\nJANINE: Honey, are you sure you're all right?\nPERI: I’m fine. I'll see you soon, yeah?\nJANINE: All right. Bye, darling.\nPERI: Bye. Oh, and bye, bye, Mrs Van Gysengham.\nMRS VAN G: You let her get away with too much.\nJANINE: She has to find her own way.\nMRS VAN G: Huh. She’s up to something.\nJANINE: I Know, but what can I do? She’s 18. I can hardly lock her in her room.\nMRS VAN G: In my day, we made sure that children were\nJANINE: Yes, yes, yes, all right. But this is Peri we’re talking about. She knows what she’s doing. Now get your bag and let’s go. Although, knowing my daughter, there’s bound to be a man involved.\nDOCTOR: Come on, Peri.\nPERI: Just a minute.\nDOCTOR: Honestly, I don’t know what takes you so long. It’s not as if you end up wearing much.\nPERI: And there was me thinking you didn’t notice.\nDOCTOR: You’re not exactly dressed for the Ice Caves of Shabadabadon.\nPERI: I can’t see any Ice Caves, Doctor. In fact, there’s a distinct lack of ice and a total absence of caves.\nDOCTOR: Yes, yes, yes. I thought we’d take a slight detour first. This is the Gogglebox. What do you think?\nPERI: Cool.\nDOCTOR: Cool? The Gogglebox is one of the human race’s greatest achievements. Look at it! Embrace it.\nPERI: Human? They all look a bit alien to me.\nDOCTOR: Oh, your lot are on one of their day trips away from Earth space. Solar flares or intergalactic wars or something. The usual.\nPERI: Same old same old. So, where are we?\nDOCTOR: The Gogglebox! One of the human races\nPERI: Greatest achievements. I’m embracing it already. But where are we?\nDOCTOR: Deep, deep down inside the Moon.\nPERI: The Moon? The Moon moon? My Moon?\nDOCTOR: I don’t think it’s solely the property of Miss Perpugilliam Brown, but yes, Earth’s Moon.\nPERI: Wow. Now that really is cool.\nDOCTOR: Well, I’m glad you’re finally impressed. Want to explore?\nPERI: Do I have a choice?\nDOCTOR: You. Yes, you.\nDOCTOR: ALAN56: (Black country accent) Yes, sir. How can I help you?\nDOCTOR: My young friend and I have just arrived and we'd like to experience what the Gogglebox has to offer.\nALANS: (sigh) Really. My name is Alan56 and I’m overjoyed to be showing you around the wondrous delights of the Gogglebox.\nPERI: Overjoyed?\nALANS: Yes, overjoyed. Now, if you'll follow me.\nPERI: I thought you said all the humans were gone.\nDOCTOR: I suspect Alan56 here is a clone.\nALANSE: That’s right. The Gogglebox is staffed by 108 clones of the original Alan. And as he was happy to help, so are we all.\nPERI: You don’t sound it.\nPERI: ALANS5S6: I have been here for over two thousand years.\nPERI: Oh. Never fancied trying anything else?\nPERI: ALAN5E6: No.\nPERI: He’s a bundle of laughs. So, er, what is this Gogglebox thing?\nALANSE: It’s an access system. It lets you view every recorded media event from the human race’s history.\nDOCTOR: Oh, come on, Alan. Put some welly into it. Peri, the Gogglebox lets you witness, no, experience anything. You can watch the first television performance of the Pussycat Dolls, the opening of the Jupiter colonies, every Police Academy film. You can see Battleship Potemkin, the creation of the Euro-combine, mankind’s momentous first meeting with the Mysterious Mymm! The human race has so much history, Peri. Oh, you could watch the execution of Great Britain’s last ruling monarch.\nPERI: I could see what they’re up to at home!\nDOCTOR: What?\nPERI: Alan, can I see the news from America in 1984?\nDOCTOR: What, that’s it? You could see anything, anything at all from Earth’s history, and that’s it? ALAN5B6: You could see that, madam, yes.\nPERI: Fantastic!\nDOCTOR: Didn’t you hear me? Anything!\nPERI: Yeah, and that’s what I wanna watch. What about you?\nDOCTOR: I need to find a book.\nPERI: Barbara Cartland’s latest?\nDOCTOR: No, no. I think... Hmm, now that’s odd.\nPERI: What, you thinking?\nDOCTOR: You’re quite the Oscar Wilde today, aren’t you.\nPERI: I try.\nDOCTOR: No, it’s odd that for some reason I think I left it here, in the Gogglebox, but I can’t really remember.\nPERI: And it’s important, this book?\nDOCTOR: It’s possibly the most important book in all of space and time! You don’t know the...\nPERI: Damage it could cause. Yeah, yeah, okay, well, you go and find this so important book, and I'll check\nPERI: out what’s happening at home.\nDOCTOR: Alan, torture her. Plug her in.\nPERI: Hey.\nPERI: ALANS5SE6: Very well. Madam, please step into the booth.\nPERI: Oh. Right. Why thank you, kind sir. So, I just sit here?\nDOCTOR: Given this is an empty room with a chair in it, it’s probably a good idea, yes.\nPERI: Smart a... (door closes)\nDOCTOR: And now, Alan, perhaps you help me look for my book. The fate of the entire universe could depend upon it.\nALANSE: I’m sure it could, sir.\nPERI: Er, hello?\nPERI: BOOTH/71: Hello, and welcome to Booth 71.

Alan!\nPERI: ALAN32: Yes, madam?\nALAN: Yes, madam.\nPERI: Oh, clones. Great. Where’s the Doctor?\nPERI: ALAN32: The Doctor is with Alan56. Shall I take you to him?\nALAN: Would you rather I did?\nPERI: I don’t care which one of you. Look, just take me to him.\nPERI: ALANS32: Hi, Alan56.\nPERI: ALAN5SB6: Alan32, hello.\nPERI: ALAN32: This madam would like to talk to the Doctor.\nPERI: ALAN56: He said he was not to be disturbed under any circumstances.\nPERI: Yeah, yeah, he always says that. Where is he?\nDOCTOR: He’s here. Alan, I’ve asked 14 of you, and no one seems to have any idea of where the book is.\nPERI: Doctor, we’ve got to go back to the Tardis.\nDOCTOR: Oh, do we, indeed. May I ask why?\nPERI: Someone’s been murdered back home.\nDOCTOR: Well, there’s not much we can do about it now. Now Alan, about this book.\nPERI: You don’t understand. I knew him.\nDOCTOR: Peri, we’re thousands of years into your future. Everyone you know there is dead.\nPERI: (crying) Doctor, take me home. I’ve got to see my Mom and... oh God, Kathy.\nDOCTOR: Kathy?\nPERI: She’s my... was my best friend. Anthony’s daughter.\nDOCTOR: Anthony?\nPERI: The man who’s been murdered! Come on, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Very well. Although I don’t see what good it'll do. Thanks for your hospitality, Alan. Alans.\nALANS: Thank you, Doctor. Well, keep up, Peri. We’ve a murder to investigate.\nDOCTOR: So he was a close friend, then?\nPERI: He was my best friend’s dad.\nDOCTOR: You know we can’t stop it happening. We can’t change history.\nPERI: I know! I just want to go to the funeral.\nDOCTOR: Yeah, very well. Right, let’s see what else... An, here we are.\nNATALIE: [OC]: Shocked the entire community. A man is currently being questioned by local authorities in connection with Anthony Chamber’s death. The unnamed vagrant, who'd been sleeping in the graveyard\nNATALIE: Denies all knowledge of the undertaker’s tragic demise. Meanwhile, friends and family of the murdered father of two are gathered together today for his funeral. I’m Natalie Hamilton, and you’re listening to Channel VNTR, the news you can trust.\nDOCTOR: Well, here we are. Baltimore, the 24'\" of September 1984. How very grey. With an e.\nPERI: It’s weird.\nDOCTOR: What is?\nPERI: Just, one minute we’re there, thousands of years in the future, and the next, home.\nJANINE: Thank you, Reverend. I was a close friend of Anthony’s and I’m sure I speak for all\nPERI: Oh. That’s, that’s my mom. There. Right there.\nDOCTOR: Mmn,, striking woman.\nPERI: Yeah. Only she’d wear fuchsia to a funeral. No surprise it’s her making the speeches.\nDOCTOR: And what on Earth is that? Her, there. She’s got purple hair!\nPERI: Oh, that’s Mrs Van Gysengham. We met her in Lanzarote. Wonder what she’s doing here? I’d best, well, I'd better go.\nDOCTOR: Well, I won't say hello. Probably best if you catch up without me.\nPERI: Yeah. What am I gonna say? She'll want to know where I’ve been.\nDOCTOR: Well, tell her.\nPERI: Yeah, I don’t think that'll work. Wonder where Howard is?\nDOCTOR: Howard?\nPERI: My step-father. You met him before Turlough rescued me.\nDOCTOR: Peri, do you know how many people I’ve met? Really, I can’t be expected to remember all\nPERI: Not here, Doctor. Not now.\nDOCTOR: No. No, no. Well, how about I try and find out more about this vagrant character? We can meet up later.\nPERI: Yeah. Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Mmm hmm?\nPERI: Don’t... well, you know, don’t turn this into something.\nDOCTOR: Hmm?\nPERI: I mean, this is my home, yeah? My family, my friends. Don’t turn it into some big adventure.\nDOCTOR: I do wish you'd have a little bit more faith in me.\nPERI: Okay, okay. Oh, and Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Oh, what now?\nPERI: Don’t go too far. I still want to see the Ice Caves of Shabadabadoodah.\nDOCTOR: You will. Take care.\nPERI: Here goes.\nJANINE: That’s it. You two okay?\nKATHY: I can’t... Oh, I don’t know.\nJANINE: You'll be fine. Trust me.\nNATE: Gonna have to face it. He’s gone.\nKATHY: Nate, you don’t have to... oh, forget it.\nJANINE: It’s okay, kids. You’re both gonna find it difficult, but I’m here for you. Now, did you want to stay here for a while or come back to mine for the wake?\nNATE: Got plenty of beer in?\nKATHY: I don’t understand you. Daddy’s dead. Can you get that? Oh.\nPERI: Hi.\nNATE: Peri?\nPERI: Hi, Nate. Kathy. Mom.\nJANINE: So, you decided to show your face, then.\nPERI: Mom, I’ve...\nJANINE: Save it, Peri. Today for once the world does not revolve around you.\nPERI: I’m sorry.\nJANINE: Aren’t we all. Come on, you two. We'll head back. Now, it’s going to be difficult. You’re going to have every Tom, Dick and Jane telling you how sorry they are and how much they're going to miss Anthony,\nJANINE: and you're going to be feeling awful, (receding) but in a few hours it'll be over and you can just be alone.\nPERI: Mom? Mister Chambers, it’s Peri. Peri Brown? I’m sorry. Sorry I wasn’t here for you and everything, and I don’t know what to say ‘cos I am talking to a box. Sorry. I hope it wasn’t (bursts into tears).\nDOCTOR: Oh, don’t turn it into some big adventure. Honestly, you offer to help and that’s all the thanks you get. Now, how am I going to.... An ha. Purple hair. Mrs Van Gysengham?\nMRS VAN G: Hello?\nDOCTOR: Coo-ee. It’s me, Mrs Van Gysengham. Can I have a word?\nMRS VAN G: Er, yes? Er, what is it?\nDOCTOR: Ah now, terrible business, all this.\nMRS VAN G: Yes. I’m sorry, but have we er, when did we meet?\nDOCTOR: It’s me. We met in Lanzarote. Don’t you remember that night in the bar? Oh, I'll never forget the look on Howard’s face as you told that story, mmm? You know, the one where you, and then they both, and nobody (laughs) didn’t realise. Oh dear, it was such a funny story.\nMRS VAN G: Oh. Oh yes. Of course. Er, how are you?\nDOCTOR: Doctor.\nMRS VAN G: Oh, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nMRS VAN G: Of course. How are you?\nDOCTOR: Ah well, as well as can be expected after what’s happened.\nMRS VAN G: I know. A terrible business. Poor Mister Chambers.\nDOCTOR: Terrible is precisely the word. Still, at least they've got the monster who did it.\nMRS VAN G: Well, there’s the rub. He’s denying it and well, I’m not one for talk, but Daniel Woods is rather old.\nDOCTOR: Daniel Woods?\nMRS VAN G: The vagrant.\nDOCTOR: Hmm?\nMRS VAN G: He lived in a tent, you know. A tent! Who lives in a tent these days? I gather it was a blue one. Probably a Democrat. Never understood them.\nDOCTOR: Ah, no, really, no, no. Well, I wonder\nMRS VAN G: You want to know something else? I don’t think he did it.\nDOCTOR: Oh? What makes you think that?\nMRS VAN G: I'll tell you on the way. You are going to the wake, yeah?\nDOCTOR: Oh, yes.\nMRS VAN G: Hop in and I'll give you a lift.\nDOCTOR: Oh, thank you. So you don’t think it was him?\nMRS VAN G: No. No, the clues just don’t add up. (car doors slam) Belt up.\nDOCTOR: What? Oh, yes. What clues?\nMRS VAN G: Mister Chambers was quite a healthy man, all things considered.\nDOCTOR: All things considered?\nMRS VAN G: All that time surrounded by the dead. (tyres squealing) Never good for anyone’s... get out of the way! For anyone’s spirit.\nDOCTOR: Indeed. Perhaps you’d just like to slow down?\nMRS VAN G: Where is it you’re from, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Oh, you know. Watch out for the...\nMRS VAN G: English? I lived in England for a while, in London.\nDOCTOR: That, that traffic.\nMRS VAN G: I know. How anyone gets around that city alive I don’t know. My first husband owned a pub there. I didn’t really approve. The White Rabbit, on the Embankment.\nDOCTOR: Er, yes, yes, I know it. Now, Mrs Van Gysengham...\nMRS VAN G: Before he died, of course. (tyres squeal) My right of way! And that must have been eight six eight er seven years ago.\nDOCTOR: (sotto) A car accident or euthanasia? (normal) Well, I’m sorry to hear that. Now...\nMRS VAN G: After he died...\nDOCTOR: Anthony Chambers.\nMRS VAN G: I moved to Miami Beach. Lovely place, but full of old people. Then husband number two’s heart went bang. (tyres squeal) Watch it! So I moved here. It’s nice. I’ve been able to support poor Janine over the last couple of months. She’s had such a hard time of it, you know. Oh, that daughter of hers, just\nDOCTOR: Oh yes, I know. Shocking behaviour. So, Anthony Chambers was healthy and\nMRS VAN G: Oh yes, fit as a fiddle. But — and this is the clincher - Daniel Woods, he’s seventy if he’s a day, there’s no way on this Earth he could have done that to Mister Chambers.\nDOCTOR: Done what?\nMRS VAN G: Snapped his neck. He wouldn’t have had the strength. Mark my words, Doctor, that vagrant didn’t kill him.\nDOCTOR: And where (tyres squeal, gasps) where is he now?\nMRS VAN G: Daniel Woods? They're holding him at Fells Point police station. Mrs Doyle’s son works there. He’s a funny one too. Never had a girl friend.\nDOCTOR: Ah now, Mrs Van Gysengham, there’s something I’ve got to tell you.\nMRS VAN G: Yes dear, what is it?\nDOCTOR: Well, you’ve probably worked it out already.\nMRS VAN G: What’s that, my love?\nDOCTOR: I’m not just here to mourn Mister Chambers’ tragic demise. I’m here to investigate it.\nMRS VAN G: British intelligence? I thought so. Not much gets past me.\nDOCTOR: (sotto) The way you drive I’m not (normal) Yes, that’s it, yes. I need you to drive me to the police station.\nMRS VAN G: Fells Point?\nDOCTOR: Face the road!!! Sorry. Yes, yes, that’s the one.\nMRS VAN G: I knew there was something about you. Is that why you’re wearing that, that er\nDOCTOR: Oh, I’m meant to be undercover, as an American.\nMRS VAN G: How exciting. So you’re a secret agent like James Bond.\nDOCTOR: Indeed I am. And you’ve given me exactly the information I needed.\nMRS VAN G: I'll put my foot down, then.\nDOCTOR: No.\nMRS VAN G: To the police station, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: No, no, there’s really.... Oh, forget it.\nPERI: You wouldn’t believe where I’ve been, Mister Chambers. Remember that time you took me and Kathy out on the porch and showed us the Moon? Remember you had that telescope, before Nate broke it. So, you showed us the Moon and you said how one day we’d be living up there. I’ve been there, Mister Chambers. I’ve seen so much that it’s just... I wish you could have seen it. I’ve been to the past and the future, and other planets, and so much. It’s even bigger than you could have imagined.\nPERI: [OC]: I’m so sorry. I really am. I should have come back before, seen you one last time. I guess I should go home, see the others, and Mom. Wish me luck. I don’t think I’ve ever been so scared. Goodbye, Mister Chambers.\nCYBERLEADER: There is nothing to fear.\nMRS VAN G: You sure you don’t want me to wait, hun?\nDOCTOR: Oh, no, no, no, no. Thank you. You’ve been a great help.\nMRS VAN G: I'll see you at the wake, then. Bye, bye.\nDOCTOR: Bye, bye.\nDOCTOR: Carry on driving like that and it'll be your own wake. Oh. 1984. It’s never as good as the book. Oh well, here goes.\nDOCTOR: Hello.\nDOYLE: Good afternoon. Can I help you?\nDOCTOR: Yes, I hope you can. I’d like to see Mister Daniel Woods, the man you’ve charged with Anthony Chambers’ murder.\nDOYLE: Sorry, I’m afraid that won’t be possible.\nDOCTOR: Why not?\nDOYLE: Well, because he’s under arrest, for murder.\nDOCTOR: And?\nDOYLE: And that means we can’t just let anyone in.\nDOCTOR: I’m not just anyone. I’m the Doctor, and I’m here on behalf of UNIT. I presume you’ve heard of them. The United\nDOYLE: No.\nDOCTOR: Oh. Well, this case has ramifications not just for America but for the entire planet. I am here at the personal request of the Secretary General, so unless you want to be responsible for an international incident, it would probably be a good idea if you let me see him.\nDOYLE: (sighs) Do you have any identification?\nDOCTOR: Hmm? Identifi... Oh. Oh, very well. Now, let’s see. Well, I’ve got... oh, actually, would you mind holding this? No. No, that’s no good. Oh, thought I’d lost that. What on Earth’s an Oyster card? Never mind. Now, oh, that’d be handy if I were on Oakes Minor, but... ah\nDOCTOR: [OC]: An apple. You know what they say. Wait, I’ve got a library card in here somewhere. Cuddly toy.\nCYBERLEADER: Facial analysis confirms it is the Doctor.\nDOYLE: [OC]: Understood.\nDOCTOR: [OC]: Tickets to the opening night of the Rocky Horror Picture Show.\nDOCTOR: A pair of socks?\nDOYLE: That will be fine, sir. You may see the prisoner.\nDOCTOR: I may? Oh, well, that’s very good of you. Lead on.\nDOYLE: This way, sir.\nDOCTOR: Well, I’m sure you understand, we just want to get... Are you all right?\nDOYLE: Sir?\nDOCTOR: Your ear. You seem to have\nDOYLE: My ear is fine. Here we are.\nDOCTOR: Hello.\nWOODS: Who are you?\nDOCTOR: I’m here to help. Thank you. You can return to your duties.\nDOYLE: Sir.\nDOCTOR: Hello.\nWOODS: So, have you come to kill me?\nPERI: Oh God. It hasn’t changed. It’s all the same.\nWOMAN: Bobby, come inside, you’re getting soaked.\nPERI: Here goes.\nJANINE: Lost your key?\nPERI: Mom, I’m sorry.\nJANINE: Yes, you said.\nPERI: Can I come in?\nJANINE: Of course you can. Just remember why everyone’s here.\nPERI: I can’t believe he’s dead. Mister Chambers.\nJANINE: I Know. It’s wrong.\nPERI: How are Kathy and Nate taking it?\nJANINE: How do you think?\nPERI: Please don't.\nJANINE: What do you expect... Look, go and get something to eat, or something, and we'll talk later. I’ve got a full house.\nPERI: Okay. Mom, where’s Howard?\nJANINE: Well, I did accuse him of being responsible for my daughter’s death. That kind of thing tends to have a negative effect on one’s marriage.\nPERI: Dead? He thought I was dead?\nJANINE: Just go and... not now, Peri.\nDOCTOR: Hey, you’ve nothing to be scared of. I’m not here to kill you.\nWOODS: Are you... I Know who you are.\nDOCTOR: I somehow doubt that.\nWOODS: You're one of the monsters!\nDOCTOR: No.\nWOODS: Then, then you’re being controlled by them.\nDOCTOR: No.\nWOODS: Come here. Let me see.\nDOCTOR: Hmm? Ow! Gentle.\nWOODS: There’s nothing there.\nDOCTOR: And why should I have anything in my ear?\nWOODS: That’s how they do it. That’s how they control them.\nDOCTOR: Control who?\nWOODS: Everyone. I saw it. I saw it kill the undertaker.\nDOCTOR: You saw who killed Anthony Chambers?\nWOODS: Yes, it was... I saw it!\nDOCTOR: Shh, shh, shh.\nWOODS: I saw it. I saw it.\nDOCTOR: Yes?\nWOODS: Eight six eight seven.\nDOCTOR: What? What do you mean? (door opens) Officer. Oh, er, sorry, didn’t catch your name.\nDOYLE: Lieutenant Doyle, sir. I’ve brought you some coffee.\nDOCTOR: Well, that’s very good of you, but I didn’t ask for any.\nDOYLE: I brought you some anyway.\nDOCTOR: No, not today, thank you.\nDOYLE: You should drink the coffee.\nDOCTOR: Oh. Oh, I should, should I? Thank you. Ouch. Ah. It’s hot.\nDOYLE: Drink the coffee.\nDOCTOR: No.\nDOYLE: Drink it.\nDOCTOR: Why don’t you drink it? Here you go, Lieutenant Doyle.\nDOYLE: That is... that is not allowed.\nDOCTOR: Isn’t it? And why would that be, eh? (sniffs) Ah yes, you can really smell that cyanide. And usually I take mine with just a dash of milk.\nPERI: Who is it?\nKATHY: [OC]: The geek.\nPERI: Kathy, come in.\nKATHY: Here, I brought you some coffee.\nPERI: Thanks, but I’m okay.\nKATHY: Try and drink some. It’s all been a bit, well, a bit of a shock. Oh, it’s a while since I’ve been in here. Miss Brown’s boudoir.\nPERI: Tell me about it. Mom hasn’t changed a thing.\nKATHY: Pillow fight?\nPERI: God, feels like so long ago.\nKATHY: Things change.\nPERI: Yeah. Kathy, I’m so sorry about your Dad.\nKATHY: Please don't.\nPERI: What?\nKATHY: That’s all I’ve had all day. Oh, Katherine, I’m so sorry to hear about, embarrassed mumble, trail off, walk away.\nPERI: Mom said.... Did you really think I’d died?\nKATHY: Is that what she told you? No. Howard told her you were going off travelling. I mean, yeah, she was furious because he’d left you on a boat, but we all knew that wouldn’t stop you.\nPERI: It nearly did. I nearly drowned. And they split up over that?\nKATHY: I guess there were other issues. Let’s face it, he never really gave your Mom the respect she deserved. I think that was the final straw.\nPERI: Yeah, right. Poor Howard.\nKATHY: So, where have you been?\nPERI: Oh, you know, all over. And then some.\nKATHY: You could have sent a postcard. It’s been four months.\nPERI: Four months? It’s been ye... It feels like longer. So, did you miss me?\nKATHY: Nah, not really. Course I did! Who else got me into as much trouble as you? My grades have improved though.\nPERI: What about the others? Do you still see Candy?\nKATHY: Not much. And no, she still hasn’t forgiven you for the Prom.\nPERI: (laughs) No. And what about Eunice?\nKATHY: Oh yah, you missed that. She got married!\nPERI: No way!\nKATHY: Yah, to Jason.\nPERI: No! You're lying. You are so telling me lies, Kathy Chambers.\nKATHY: No, seriously.\nPERI: And what about Nate?\nKATHY: Ah, don’t worry about him. He’s not exactly been pining after you.\nPERI: Oh, I didn’t expect him to.\nKATHY: Urgh, just thinking about you two together. (shudders)\nPERI: Hey, if it had worked out, you could have been the bridesmaid.\nKATHY: Oh, story of my life. Peri.\nPERI: Yeah?\nKATHY: Eight six eight seven.\nPERI: What?\nKATHY: What? What did I say? Oh, that'll be me losing it.\nJANINE: Hi. Hope I’m not interrupting anything.\nKATHY: Ah, just catching up, aren’t we?\nPERI: Yeah. Mom, I\nJANINE: Kathy, people are starting to leave.\nKATHY: Suppose I have to do the whole ‘thanks for coming yes I'll call you if I need anything’ shtick.\nJANINE: I’m sorry, hun, but your brother’s passed out on the sofa.\nKATHY: You coming, Peri?\nPERI: I er\nJANINE: Do you mind if she doesn’t? Actually, I’d like to talk.\nKATHY: Oh, okay. Glad you’re back.\nPERI: Yeah. Good luck.\nJANINE: Okay?\nPERI: Yeah. What about you? You glad I’m back?\nWOODS: He’s trying to poison you? I told you. I told you they’re all involved.\nDOCTOR: So it would seem. I’ve already been identified as a threat. That’s got to be a record for me.\nDOYLE: Drink the coffee, Time Lord.\nDOCTOR: At gunpoint? That’s a sweetener, certainly. Now, officer, this coffee, oh it is hot, isn’t it?\nDOYLE: Yes, so drink\nDOCTOR: Drink it. I know. Or, I could suddenly, say, throw it in your face? Now that would scald you, possibly distract you long enough for Mister Woods and I to escape.\nDOYLE: That is logical..\nDOCTOR: That’s what I thought. And logically, would you want me to do that? Throw the coffee in your face?\nDOYLE: That would impair my sight. If my sight was impaired then I could not sufficiently carry out my function.\nDOCTOR: Therefore the logical thing to do would be to let us escape without me throwing it at you.\nDOYLE: That is... logical.\nDOCTOR: Very good. Come along, Mister Woods.\nWOODS: He’s being controlled.\nDOCTOR: Indeed he is, but not terribly well. Either the Lieutenant has a strong will, or the control is rather weak.\nWOODS: Yeah, but who by? Who's controlling him?\nDOCTOR: Oh, I’ve got a good idea.\nWOODS: Who's doing this?\nDOCTOR: The real question is, how many others are affected? And that would appear to be the answer. No, don’t come any closer. I’ve got coffee, and I’m not afraid to use it.\nWOODS: Who are you?\nDOCTOR: The Doctor. They’re waiting for new orders, so let’s get out of here.\nWOODS: And go where?\nDOCTOR: Where else, Mister Woods. The graveyard, of course. The scene of the crime. I want to know what happened\nPERI: What do you mean?\nJANINE: I said, I want to know what happened. Where have you been?\nPERI: Travelling.\nJANINE: Oh, come on, you owe me more than that.\nPERI: You wouldn't believe me.\nJANINE: Try me. Your travelling destroyed my marriage.\nPERI: Don’t say that.\nJANINE: You’re not a child. You can face the truth. You come to my hotel room and tell me that you'll find something to do. I come back from the caves and Howard tells me you’re going travelling with some English guys. He says he’s left you on a boat and that you’re fine. Then we go to fetch you and you’re gone! We thought you’d drowned! Of course, he was more worried about some artefact you’d stolen.\nPERI: I didn’t mean to. I didn’t want to. It was an accident.\nJANINE: Where did you go for four months? Where did you go? When were you thinking of coming back, huh? Next month? Next year? 1986, 87? When?\nPERI: I... fine. There was this man.\nJANINE: Oh well, there’s a surprise.\nPERI: Like mother, like daughter.\nJANINE: Don't even try it. Your father died, I moved on.\nPERI: Pretty quickly, though.\nJANINE: You know what? I’m not going to apologise anymore. You think what you like.\nPERI: Oh, I do.\nJANINE: You're a selfish little... You don’t even care, do you.\nPERI: You, you know what? Coming back was a mistake. I’ve changed, moved on, grown up.\nJANINE: Well, why don’t you just go, then? We all coped fine without you. In fact, I’ll get you a suitcase and you can do it properly this time.\nDOCTOR: Are you all right?\nWOODS: Yeah. I... it’s difficult, being back here. I still don’t understand. Why have we come back?\nDOCTOR: Because there’s clearly something going on, and if I don’t stop it, then who will?\nWOODS: You’re a most peculiar young man.\nDOCTOR: Well, that’s the nicest thing anyone’s said to me all day. Right, in we go. Once more into the breach and all that..\nWOODS: It’s very quiet.\nDOCTOR: Graveyards usually are, Mister Woods.\nWOODS: Call me Daniel.\nDOCTOR: So tell me, Daniel. What happened?\nWOODS: I er, well, I was sleeping here.\nDOCTOR: In the graveyard.\nWOODS: It’s er, it’s a long story.\nDOCTOR: Just the edited highlights, please.\nWOODS: My wife died.\nDOCTOR: Oh. Oh, I’m sorry. Were you together long?\nWOODS: Thirty one years. We were happy. Then in August she... Maureen was hit by a bus. The number 8.\nDOCTOR: I am sorry.\nWOODS: Stupid, really. 68 years old. Fought cancer for seven years. Survived the war. Survived me. Then out she goes. She’d run out of shampoo. Stepped out into the road and bang, she’s gone.\nDOCTOR: Maureen Woods. A much-missed wife. Sweet dreams. It’s a beautiful headstone.\nWOODS: I couldn’t afford anything too fancy.\nDOCTOR: No, it’s quiet and understated. There’s nothing worse than being gaudy and ostentatious. So, tell me, Daniel, how did you end up sleeping here?\nWOODS: That’s not important. I was here, and I saw it.\nDOCTOR: The monster.\nWOODS: Silver. It was a silver ghost.\nDOCTOR: A ghost?\nWOODS: I heard it. I heard its voice.\nPERI: Fine. Clearly I haven’t been missed.\nJANINE: So, Kathy, is everyone gone then?\nKATHY: Yeah. Bert and Mary said thanks for everything. Oh, and Mrs White said she’d bring over that [Doors??] thing tomorrow.\nJANINE: Right, thanks. What are you doing? What’s that?\nKATHY: A box of stuff Dad left. Found it under his bed. Silly stuff, really. Report cards, Nate’s sporting certificates, baby clothes. Who knew he was so sentimental?\nJANINE: He loved you so much, you know. I just wish\nKATHY: Peri.\nJANINE: Not much gets past you, does it?\nKATHY: What happened?\nJANINE: She doesn’t care. She doesn’t give a damn about what she’s put us through.\nKATHY: Let me guess, you had a fight with her.\nJANINE: I didn’t mean to. Oh, Kathy, I’m sorry. This is the last thing you need today.\nKATHY: Janine, ever since Mom died, you’ve been there for us. You know, when we were kids, I always wondered if you and Dad would... you know.\nJANINE: Me and Anthony?\nKATHY: Yeah. But then you met Howard and, well, I guess it wasn’t meant to happen.\nJANINE: I'll always be around, you know.\nKATHY: Yeah, and we'll always be here for you. Well, I will be. Nate’ll be busy winning the Superbowl or\nKATHY: whatever.\nJANINE: Yeah. Why, though. Why is it I can talk to you two, but Peri?\nKATHY: I know what you mean.\nJANINE: You seem to be getting on fine.\nKATHY: No, not really. I Know how Peri works. She’s always been the cool one, never keen on saying how she feels. I just, well, I just acted like nothing had happened, but I Know what you mean. It’s almost as if... no, no, it’s a horrible thing to think.\nJANINE: Almost as if it was better when she wasn't here.\nKATHY: I don’t mean it like that. But, you know, we got used to her not being here. Can I tell you something?\nJANINE: Of course you can. What is it, love?\nKATHY: She was always the popular one. Everyone loves Peri. I was her geeky friend. And, you know, since she’s been gone, I don’t know, people are interested. Oh, you’re the girl whose best friend has disappeared. Oh, how terrible for you, how are you coping, you know? And then... okay, I’m going to say this, but I know how bad it sounds, and I don’t want you to think... Since she’s been gone, you’ve been there. It’s been you, me, Dad and Nate. I know that’s terrible and honestly, I’m so glad she’s back, but oh, I don’t know.\nJANINE: Hey, don’t think because she’s back I won’t be around for you.\nKATHY: I know.\nJANINE: And you'll be back to Boston soon, then off to have some huge and glittering medical career, and oh, what’s that?\nKATHY: A video cassette. Anthony’s birthday.\nJANINE: I wondered where that went to.\nKATHY: It’s yours?\nJANINE: Yeah. It was your dad’s 40\", remember? I'd just got the video camera.\nKATHY: And you didn’t give him the tape?\nJANINE: No. Odd. Do you want to watch it?\nKATHY: Yeah. Yeah, I do. Let’s call Peri down.\nJANINE: Don't say anything.\nKATHY: Course I won't. Peri!\nPERI: What? Hey, Kathy, what is it?\nKATHY: Come on down. I found a video\nPERI: I’m coming.\nWOODS: I shouldn’t have listened.\nDOCTOR: But you did. So, did you just hear the ghost’s voice or did you hear Mister Chambers too?\nWOODS: I didn’t imagine it!\nDOCTOR: Yes, I know. Shh. I know. Now, tell me what happened.\nWOODS: I was er, I was over there, under the trees.\nDOCTOR: Uh huh.\nWOODS: Trying to sleep, when I, when I heard him. The undertaker.\nDOCTOR: Did you know Mister Chambers?\nWOODS: I'd seen him around. He’d not long moved into that building. The one next to the church. It was his home as well as his office.\nDOCTOR: An undertaker’s office in the graveyard. Convenient for work, I suppose.\nWOODS: It was empty for years. One day he bought it and just moved in.\nDOCTOR: When will people learn that buildings are usually abandoned for a reason. So, you were trying to sleep and then you heard him.\nWOODS: He was shouting, terrified. It was as if, I don’t know.\nDOCTOR: And what was he saying?\nWOODS: Just kill me.\nPERI: Hi. So, what’s this video?\nKATHY: It’s Dad’s birthday.\nPERI: Oh. Are you sure... do you want to watch it?\nNATE: (yawns) Watch what?\nPERI: Sleeping Beauty’s woken up, then.\nNATE: Oh, I don’t feel... Oh God.\nJANINE: Peri, do you want to set up the VCR, and I'll get Nate some Pepto-Bismol.\nNATE: You always know what I need.\nPERI: Fine.\nKATHY: Things not good between you two?\nPERI: She hasn’t changed. Nothing round here’s changed, has it?\nKATHY: Sorry? You know, your mom’s been good to us.\nPERI: Yeah, well, let’s just put the video on.\nNATE: So, where have you been?\nPERI: You missed me?\nNATE: Yeah. Course.\nPERI: And of course you saved yourself for me.\nNATE: Yeah.\nPERI: Course you did. Anyway, here goes.\nJANINE: [OC]: Here we are, then. Anthony’s big birthday bash. Anthony!\nANTHONY: [OC]: Cheers!\nJANINE: [OC]: So, Anthony, are you enjoying the party?\nANTHONY: [OC]: Yes. Will you stop filming me?\nJANINE: [OC]: Zoom in. Whoo, that’s some nose. What strange creatures live in a mass of nasal hair.\nANTHONY: [OC]: Okay, stop it now.\nJANINE: [OC]: No, seriously. For a forty year old it’s a fine nose indeed.\nANTHONY: [OC]: No, no, no, no. No, don’t say the F word. Not forty!\nJANINE: [OC]: Let’s face it, the big four oh.\nANTHONY: [OC]: Oh, just kill me. Kill me now.\nDOCTOR: Just kill me. That’s all he said?\nWOODS: I don’t like to remember. Listen, Doctor. Thanks for your help, but I’ve got to go. I can’t be here. This is nothing to do with me.\nDOCTOR: Well, it’s nothing to do with me, either.\nWOODS: Well then, leave it.\nDOCTOR: Well, perhaps you’re right. I mean, the man’s dead now. What good would it do trying to find out what happened?\nWOODS: Exactly. It’s best just to leave it all alone.\nDOCTOR: And we'll do the same when it happens again.\nWOODS: Again?\nDOCTOR: You know, the next time your silver ghost decided to kill someone, well, as long as we’re not here\nWOODS: You think it'll happen again? No, no, no, I don’t care. I’m sorry, but it, it’s nothing to do with me.\nDOCTOR: I know. Nothing to do with either of us. Come on, then. (whistles)\nWOODS: I, I don’t know...\nDOCTOR: So, you say your wife had cancer.\nWOODS: Yeah.\nDOCTOR: A terrible disease. She had it for seven years? Must have been a strong woman to fight it for so long.\nWOODS: She was.\nDOCTOR: When was she given the all-clear?\nWOODS: Summer of ’81.\nDOCTOR: And then she died, what, a month ago?\nWOODS: Yes. Doctor, what\nDOCTOR: Well, the doctors shouldn't really have bothered, should they? I mean, they cure her cancer only for her to die three years later. Hardly worth it.\nWOODS: What! Of course it was worth it! Those three years were the... they were the happiest we’d\nDOCTOR: Go on.\nWOODS: They were the happiest we’d ever been.\nDOCTOR: Those doctors, your wife, they didn’t give up. They could have done.\nWOODS: I’m scared.\nDOCTOR: Honestly? So am I.\nWOODS: But there’s nothing... The police are being controlled. What can we do?\nDOCTOR: Stand up. Do our best. Keep on trying.\nWOODS: Yeah, okay. Okay. I'll tell you what happened. I'll tell you what he said.\nANTHONY: [OC]: I said, stop filming me. Go find someone else.\nJANINE: [OC]: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Where’s... oh, Kathy, Kathy, Katherine. What is it with you guys? Come on, smile for the camera.\nKATHY: [OC]: No, not going to. Look, me not smiling.\nJANINE: [OC]: Oh, just a little one. Go on for your Auntie Janine.\nNATE: [OC]: Hey, hey.\nJANINE: [OC]: I didn’t think you’d be shy, Nate.\nNATE: [OC]: Where do you want me? How do you want me?\nJANINE: [OC]: Oh, if only I was twenty years younger, honey.\nNATE: [OC]: I’m not a little boy any more.\nJANINE: [OC]: Oh, I don’t think so.\nJANINE: Oh no, what do I sound like? Here you go.\nNATE: Thanks.\nKATHY: We were... it was a good day.\nPERI: It looks like it.\nANTHONY: [OC]: Firstly, I want to thank you all for coming, and I want to thank Janine especially for organising it. She’s had a bad couple of months recently, and I’m sure that we're all still praying for er, for Peri. But if she’s anything like her mother, then I’m sure she can cope with anything life throws at her. Er, okay. Also I wanna just, well, I wanna say sorry. I Know that I’ve been a bit off recently. Perhaps it was moving in to the new office or something, but I know that I’ve been a bit... moody.\nKATHY: [OC]: Oh, just a bit.\nANTHONY: [OC]: Well, thank you, Katherine. So, I just wanna say sorry for that, and that things are going to change. I’m changing. I’m er, well, now’s probably not the right time to tell you, but, I’m quitting my job. I know, I Know, I know, I’ve been undertaking for years, but I think the time’s come for me to do something else. I’m not sure what yet, but er\nJANINE: [OC]: What's that light?\nANTHONY: [OC]: What light?\nJANINE: [OC]: Flashing. Am I having a stroke?\nANTHONY: [OC]: Oh, Mrs Foster.\nJANINE: [OC]: You’re very... Oh, you know, must be the battery.\nANTHONY: [OC]: On the camera? Quickly, Janine, point it to me.\nJANINE: [OC]: What?\nANTHONY: [OC]: Kids, if you’re watching this, I just wanna say, keep playing.\nJANINE: [OC]: Keep playing?\nPERI: Keep playing?\nJANINE: It’s sad. Almost as if... oh, sorry, kids.\nKATHY: That’s all right. It was good to see him.\nNATE: Yeah. Cheers, Dad.\nPERI: Keep playing. Doesn’t that strike anyone as, like, a bit odd?\nJANINE: He’d had a bit to drink. He just meant for Kathy and Nate to, I dunno, enjoy life. Here, Kathy, you keep the tape.\nKATHY: Thanks. (sighs)\nJANINE: What?\nKATHY: It’s all over, isn’t it? The funeral, everyone’s gone. Everything else starts now.\nNATE: Life without Dad. I never thought.\nPERI: Keep playing. What did he mean?\nJANINE: Oh, do be quiet, Peri. It doesn’t matter.\nPERI: But don’t you see? It’s as if he knew. Somehow Mister Chambers knew he was going to die!\nNATE: Yeah, all right, Peri. Now’s not the time.\nPERI: What's wrong with you all? Can’t you see it was a message?\nKATHY: Peri, this isn’t funny. It’s all over now.\nWOODS: He was shouting ‘it’s all over now. Just kill me.’\nDOCTOR: It’s all over. What was all over?\nWOODS: He didn’t say. It sounded as if, as if he’d been working for them.\nDOCTOR: So, they came out of his office over there, they walked, what, ten, fifteen feet, to an apparently random grave. Anthony shouted ‘it’s all over now, just kill me’, and the monster killed him.\nWOODS: Yeah, yeah, that’s it.\nDOCTOR: No, no, there must have been more. Take me through it again. Try and remember exactly what he said.\nWOODS: Why? He didn’t know I could hear him.\nDOCTOR: Well, did they do anything at the grave?\nWOODS: Er, no.\nDOCTOR: And you and Anthony knew each other. You knew where he worked, so...\nWOODS: So, so he might have known. No, he would have known I was there.\nDOCTOR: So he leads the monster closer to you and then shouts at it.\nWOODS: He did. He knew I was there. He wanted me to hear.\nDOCTOR: His final message.\nPERI: It’s not all over.\nJANINE: What’s happened to you?\nPERI: Doesn't matter what’s happened to me. It’s... wait. Mom, you told him the battery was dying and he\nPERI: told you to film his last words. Keep playing. Give me the tape.\nJANINE: No, I will not! I don’t Know what's gotten into you but this is not some kind of game.\nPERI: Give me the tape.\nJANINE: Here.\nPERI: He said keep playing. He’s not just gonna say that.\nKATHY: You’re scaring me, Peri. I don’t like this.\nNATE: Yeah, just stop it now. Dad’s dead. We don’t need to...\nANTHONY: [OC]: Hi. You got my message.\nPERI: See? Told you!\nANTHONY: [OC]: Okay, kids.\nPERI: Oh, sorry.\nANTHONY: [OC]: If you’re watching this, then it means I’m gone. Amessage from beyond the grave.\nWOODS: I was half asleep, but I woke up when I heard him shouting.\nDOCTOR: Anthony or the monster?\nWOODS: Anthony. He was shouting, ‘come on then, what are you waiting for?’ And he did, he shouted ‘come and get me.’\nDOCTOR: He made the monster follow him so you could hear them clearly.\nWOODS: Yes. And it did. It followed him. I could see it in the moonlight. Silver. A silver thing.\nDOCTOR: And what did it say?\nWOODS: I, I\nDOCTOR: Think!\nWOODS: You have served your purpose, and now you will die. And he shouted back that it wasn’t working anymore. That whatever it had been using to control him, it wasn’t working anymore. He was free.\nANTHONY: [OC]: So, I’m dead then, yeah? Don’t be sad. It means I’m free.\nKATHY: Dad?\nANTHONY: [OC]: I’ve been... there’s this ... It’s so difficult to explain. You'll think I’m crazy. Here goes. There was this thing, this monster, and it’s been controlling me. It was making me do things, but somehow I broke free. I honestly don’t know how, but it just stopped working. I realised what was happening, what it was making me do and... I can’t tell you what that was because... dead... will walk soon. There’s some kind of block. Can’t say the words. So I just want to tell you both, and Janine, if you’re watching this, that I love you.\nWOODS: And then, and then it said... I can remember its voice. It was so\nDOCTOR: Alien?\nWOODS: Yes. It said, subject Anthony Chambers will be terminated. And then, then it... there was this noise. It broke his neck. I watched it as it just broke his neck! There was nothing I could do. I couldn't stop it, you understand. It would have killed me too. It just killed him!\nDOCTOR: It’s okay, it’s okay, it’s okay, I understand. Now breathe. Breathe deeply. Yes.\nWOODS: God, it’s going to get us all, isn’t it?\nDOCTOR: No. Trust me. I'll stop it.\nANTHONY: [OC]: I really do love you, and I just need you to do two things. Firstly, don’t take this to the police. They’re being controlled. I don’t know who else is. Don’t trust anyone. And secondly, don’t go back to the graveyard. It’s still there. In fact, get out of Baltimore. Get away from here and go and be safe somewhere. Just watch out for it.\nDOCTOR: I'll make sure you’re safe. But tell me, did this monster say anything after it killed Anthony Chambers?\nWOODS: Yes. You will be like us.\nANTHONY: [OC]: Kathy, Nate, watch out for it. Beware of the Cyberman.\nPERI: Cyberman!\nNATALIE: Okay, can we check the levels? I’m just getting static. Tony, can you check the mics? Hi, Lieutenant Doyle?\nDOYLE: That’s right.\nNATALIE: Great. So I’m going to introduce you, and you do your little spiel about the escaped prisoner.\nDOYLE: That’s right. This is what we'll be saying.\nNATALIE: We? Er, don’t you think this is a bit extreme? I’m all for giving the story a bit of oomph, but this?\nDOYLE: There is a problem?\nNATALIE: I’m a journalist, Lieutenant. I can’t just go and... what are you doing?\nDOYLE: There is nothing to fear.\nNATALIE: What? No, get away from me, you freak. What's that?\nDOYLE: Put it in your ear.\nNATALIE: I will not.\nDOYLE: Then I will.\nNATALIE: What is... Oh. I understand.\nDOYLE: You will be like us.\nDOCTOR: You will be like us.\nWOODS: What was it?\nDOCTOR: As I suspected the moment that policeman tried to kill me. Cybermen.\nWOODS: Are they ghosts?\nDOCTOR: Oh, that’s not too far from the truth. They were once people just like you, men, women and children. But they were dying. Their planet, Mondas, was dying. I saw it. I was there when it happened. They just wanted to live a little longer. They just wanted their children to have a future.\nWOODS: What did they do?\nDOCTOR: They changed. Developed a technology that could change them, help them lose their weak human bodies. Help them become stronger, invulnerable. Help them to survive. Sadly, it went wrong. They lost their individuality, their emotions, their souls. They became\nWOODS: Monsters?\nDOCTOR: Yes. So completely tragic and senseless.\nWOODS: Why have they come here?\nDOCTOR: Mondas is destroyed two years from now. They’re homeless, so they come back here for the same reason as they go anywhere. They want you to become like them. It’s their logic, you see. They won't stop until every single living creature is like them.\nWOODS: Can you, can you stop them?\nDOCTOR: Hmm? Oh, of course I can. I might need some help, though.\nWOODS: Are you alone?\nDOCTOR: My young friend is dealing with family issues.\nWOODS: And you?\nDOCTOR: I don’t have issues. So, how about it? How do you fancy saving the Earth?\nWOODS: I guess, well, yes. Yes, I do want to help.\nDOCTOR: Good man. Now, what we need to do first\nPERI: Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Peri? What are you doing... oh, and you’ve brought company.\nKATHRY: What’s going on?\nNATE: Yeah, Peri. Why have you brought us here?\nJANINE: Peri.\nPERI: 8687.\nNATALIE: With me here in the studio is Lieutenant Doyle of the Baltimore police.\nDOYLE: Thank you. The vagrant charged with the brutal murder of father of two Anthony Chambers, has escaped. He’s believed to still be in the Fells Point neighbourhood and is on the run with an accomplice known only as the Doctor. If you see either of these men, do not approach them. While these two dangerous criminals are on the loose, we’re suggesting that local residents stay indoors. This may seem extreme, but we do believe that the two men will stop at nothing to escape justice. Please, do not panic, but please, do stay in your homes. Trust us. We'll get them before they strike again.\nNATALIE: Thanks, Lieutenant Doyle. And of course we trust you. So, to all our listeners, we ask that you be like us. Keep safe, and stay inside with your loved ones. I’m Natalie Hamilton, and you're listening to channel VNTR, the news you can trust.\nPERI: I knew you’d be here, Doctor. The scene of the crime.\nDOCTOR: I know, I know, but Peri, it’s\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR+ PERI: Cybermen!\nPERI: I know.\nDOCTOR: Oh. Daniel here saw... oh, Peri, Daniel. Daniel, Peri.\nPERI: Hey. Anthony left a message on the tape. He knew he was gonna die. I’ve got the video here in my bag.\nDOCTOR: You brought a video cassette to a graveyard? What, you think one of the headstones might double up as an entertainment system?\nPERI: Says the man carrying a cup of coffee.\nDOCTOR: Oh, have I still got that? Not just a cup of coffee. A poisoned cup of coffee.\nPERI: Ah.\nDOCTOR: So, Mister Chambers knew he was going to die. Now that matches with what Daniel said. He\nDOCTOR: thinks Anthony was\nDOCTOR: DOCTOR+PERI: Being controlled.\nPERI: I know! So what do we do?\nDOCTOR: I think we need to make a\nJANINE: Can someone tell me what’s going on?\nKATHY: What's a Cyberman?\nNATE: Who killed Dad?\nWOODS: Who are you?\nDOCTOR: Your turn with the introductions, Peri.\nPERI: Okay. This is my mom, Janine, and Kathy and Nate Chambers, Anthony’s kids, and this is the Doctor.\nNATE: No, wait. What is all this? Peri, what’s going on?\nKATHY: Just a minute. Daniel? You said Daniel?\nWOODS: That’s, that’s right.\nKATHY: Daniel Woods.\nWOODS: Yes. Please, believe me when I say I had nothing to do with your father’s death.\nDOCTOR: Of course you didn’t. I think we’ve clearly established that.\nPERI: Why are the Cybermen here?\nKATHY: No, wait. I don’t think anything’s been clearly established at all. Peri, what is going on? Who is this man?\nPERI: I told you, the Doctor.\nKATHY: I can’t. No, I can’t do this. (leaves)\nWOODS: I'll go after her.\nDOCTOR: Kathy, Mister Woods, wait! You know, I’m sure I know her from somewhere.\nPERI: Kathy?\nDOCTOR: Oh, who knows? Perhaps she becomes famous.\nJANINE: What’s going on? Who are you?\nJANINE: PERI+DOCTOR: The Doctor.\nDOCTOR: I see where you get it from now. She never listens either.\nPERI: Charming. He’s the Doctor, Mom. That’s who he is.\nJANINE: Not him. you. Who are you?\nPERI: Me? Mom, I’m... This is what I do.\nNATE: Peri, what’s happened to you?\nPERI: I deal with things like this. I deal with monsters.\nDOCTOR: With things like that! Come on, Peri!\nNATE: Mrs Foster? Janine?\nJANINE: What’s happened to her, Nate?\nNATE: We should go and... Kathy.\nJANINE: Yes, yes, we should.\nDOCTOR: What is it, Kathy? What’s wrong?\nKATHY: 8687.\nDOCTOR: No, no, not that.\nWOODS: We heard something.\nPERI: Kathy. Kathy, listen to me. What did you hear?\nKATHY: A sound. Something moving.\nPERI: Where?\nKATHY: Down there.\nNATE: Dad? Dad’s grave?\nWOODS: It was a scratching, from the coffin.\nJANINE: Right, this stops now. Doctor, I don’t know who you are, but this stops now.\nDOCTOR: Oh, do be quiet.\nPERI: Doctor!\nDOCTOR: All of you, be quiet. Just listen.\nNATE: Dad.\nWOODS: Nobody breaks free.\nDOCTOR: Get back! Get back, all of you.\nJANINE: What is it?\nKATHY: Where’s Dad?\nPERI: That’s him.\nDOCTOR: He’s become a Cyberman.\nDOCTOR: CYBER-ANTHONY: 8687.\nNATE: That’s not... who are you? What are you? CYBER-ANTHONY: It is me. It is Dad."

They’re to be considered highly dangerous, and should be taken... dead... or alive.\nKATHY: Daddy?\nDOCTOR: Keep back. He’s not your father. Not any more.\nNATE: But he came out of Dad’s coffin. It was Dad’s coffin.\nPERI: Trust me, that’s not Anthony, not any more.\nJANINE: How do you know?\nPERI: I just do, all right?\nDOCTOR: Hello, I’m the Doctor and these are my friends. Do you recognise any of them? CYBER-ANTHONY: The Doctor. Enemy. Doctor Time Lord.\nKATHY: He’s confused.\nDOCTOR: Of course he is, he’s not been fully converted.\nKATHY: Converted? Converted into what? Dad!\nDOCTOR: Listen to me. Can you recognise anyone else here? Look at us. Look at us one by one, that’s it, and tell me if you recognise any one of us.\nDOCTOR: CYBER-ANTHONY: You are Doctor. Records, you enemy.\nDOCTOR: That’s right. And anyone else?\nKATHY: Dad?\nKATHY: CYBER-ANTHONY: The young, young female, she is\nKATHY: Yes?\nKATHY: CYBER-ANTHONY: Perpugilliam Brown, also enemy.\nPERI: Oh great. It remembers me.\nDOCTOR: They’ve long memories and very thorough records. And anyone else? CYBER-ANTHONY: They are, they are irrelevant.\nNATE: Dad.\nDOCTOR: Do you see? It doesn’t Know you. That isn’t him, not any more. CYBER-ANTHONY: They are irrelevant. They will be converted.\nDOCTOR: Over my dead body. Everyone, run!\nPERI: Okay, we'll go back to Mom’s house.\nDOCTOR: No, I’m staying here. I want to look around Anthony’s office. You take the others.\nPERI: I’m not leaving you.\nDOCTOR: Peri, just for once, can’t you just... Oh.\nJANINE: What is it? Why have we stopped?\nDOCTOR: Look.\nJANINE: Oh, the police! That’s great! That’s exactly what we need! Hello!\nPERI: Doctor, Anthony said on the video\nDOCTOR: Mrs Brown!\nPERI: Foster.\nDOCTOR: Mrs Foster! Come back!\nJANINE: Please, you’ve got to help us. There’s this thing in there, back there, coming after us. And also the man you’re looking for, he’s here. The one who killed Anthony and... hello?\nPERI: Mom!\nDOCTOR: Stay back, Peri.\nJANINE: What is it?\nWOODS: They’re being controlled too.\nJANINE: Hello, can you hear me? Turn off the headlights, they’re blinding us.\nDOYLE: (loudspeaker) There is nothing to fear.\nJANINE: I’m not one to argue, but actually there is. (screams)\nPERI: Mom, come back!\nJANINE: What’s going on?\nDOYLE: (loudspeaker) There is nothing to fear. You will be like us.\nDOCTOR: Come on, everyone. To Anthony's office.\nNATE: Where’s that thing, the thing that isn’t Dad?\nDOCTOR: I can’t see. Those headlights. They’re clever. We'll just have to run blind. Now come on!\nWOODS: It’s over here!\nJANINE: Why not the church?\nPERI: Anthony knew. We need to find out what the Cybermen were making him do.\nDOCTOR: Quickly, everyone. Inside. One, two, three, four, get in, five. That’s it.\nDOYLE: Suspects are trapped inside.\nDOYLE: [OC]: The Doctor is trapped.\nCYBERLEADER: Excellent. They are with me now. Surround the building.\nDOYLE: [OC]: Yes, sir.\nDOYLE: There is nothing to fear.\nDOCTOR: Is everyone all right?\nWOODS: I’m too old for this.\nJANINE: Right, I’m gonna call... no, no need to call the police, obviously.\nPERI: Mom, I’m sorry.\nKATHY: They’re just standing there, watching.\nJANINE: Katherine, come away from the window.\nKATHY: Why aren’t they coming after us?\nJANINE: I said, get away from the window. For once just listen to me.\nPERI: Mom, it’s okay. There’s no need to get so\nJANINE: No, it’s not okay, Peri. Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Hmm?\nJANINE: Look at me.\nDOCTOR: What is it?\nJANINE: What the hell have you done to my daughter? What is going on? They’re just children, and because of you they're here.\nPERI: Hey, that’s not fair. I brought you here.\nJANINE: And you're just a kid. I don’t know what’s happened here, but you’re just a\nWOODS: I’m sorry, but can I just say that I saw Anthony being murdered. I saw what happened. We need to stop it.\nJANINE: And just who the hell are you? You're the one they say killed him.\nWOODS: I’m sorry, I... Mrs Foster, yes?\nJANINE: Yes.\nWOODS: Okay, Mrs Foster. If we don’t do something, if we don’t try and stop all this, then what happened to Anthony, what’s happened to all of them out there, that’s going to happen to all of us. Don’t you see? We have to try and stop it.\nJANINE: They’re just children.\nNATE: We're not. He’s right.\nJANINE: I just, I just wanna make sure you’re safe, all three of you.\nDOCTOR: Then we need to stop this happening. Okay, Peri. What do you think?\nPERI: Well, there’s a Cyberman and it brainwashed Anthony.\nWOODS: And the police.\nPERI: And the police.\nDOCTOR: So why Anthony Chambers?\nPERI: Something to do with his job. He said the dead will walk.\nDOCTOR: Which we’ve already seen.\nKATHY: The coffin.\nDOCTOR: Exactly. It’s the coffins, it has to be. But this isn’t like them. They usually convert the living.\nPERI: I remember.\nDOCTOR: And now they’re using the dead. Tell me, Mrs Foster. How long had Anthony been working here?\nJANINE: Er, about three months.\nNATE: And it was just after starting here that Dad changed. He became quiet, distant.\nDOCTOR: So let’s assume that after Anthony moved here, somehow a Cyberman managed to take control of his mind. It made him install some kind of conversion unit into the coffins. Any idea how many people have been buried here in the last three months?\nKATHY: At least twenty.\nDOCTOR: So that’s twenty more out there like your father, waiting underground. Waiting to be activated.\nWOODS: Maureen.\nDOCTOR: Your wife? I’m sorry, Daniel.\nWOODS: She could be alive?\nDOCTOR: No, no. They’re not alive. Look at Anthony. He didn’t recognise his own children. They’re not alive.\nJANINE: Peri. It recognised Peri.\nPERI: We’ve met the Cybermen before, Mom.\nJANINE: Where have you been?\nPERI: But wait! Doctor, Doctor, we met them in 1985! That’s next year.\nKATHY: What?\nDOCTOR: Next year? That means they’re from the future. Oh, brilliant, just brilliant. So now we’re dealing with time-travelling Cybermen. Oh, this gets better.\nWOODS: So what do we do?\nDOCTOR: Well, we can wait here, wait to die.\nPERI: And become like them.\nJANINE: Or we do something about it.\nDOCTOR: Exactly. We need to look around here. The policeman I met had something in his ear, some kind of controlling device.\nWOODS: They all do.\nDOCTOR: Which means somewhere there’s a unit controlling them, and I’d hazard a guess that it’s in here somewhere.\nPERI: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Yes?\nPERI: Doesn’t that mean... doesn’t that mean there’s likely to be a Cyberman in this building, controlling them?\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid so, yes. That’s why they don’t want us leaving.\nJANINE: There’s a back door. Which they'll be watching too.\nDOCTOR: Nathaniel, Kathy, you know this place better than any of us.\nKATHY: Well, this is Dad’s office, and through there is... is where he keeps the bodies.\nNATE: And then upstairs is where we live. Lived.\nPERI: You live here? In the graveyard?\nKATHY: Dad said it'd be easy for work.\nDOCTOR: Whereas actually it made it easier for the Cybermen. Right. Peri, you take the others upstairs, 1’ll go through the back and see what’s there.\nPERI: I’m coming with you.\nJANINE: You’re not.\nPERI: I am.\nJANINE: Then I’m coming with you.\nDOCTOR: All right, all right, fine. You three go upstairs, have a look round but make yourselves safe. I need you to find a room which can be locked from the inside.\nWOODS: Understood. Come on you two.\nKATHY: Peri, they said he killed my\nPERI: It’s all right. You'll be fine.\nNATE: Come on, Kathy. Let’s go. Mister Woods?\nPERI: Okay. Mom? Doctor? Let’s go look at that morgue.\nDOYLE: Halt. Who’s there?\nDOYLE: CYBER-ANTHONY: I... I remember I was Anthony Chambers. Now who am I?\nDOYLE: You’re a Cyberman. You’re what we all will be.\nDOYLE: CYBER-ANTHONY: I... I... feel fear.\nDOYLE: That'll pass. The Leader says that you will soon stop feeling.\nDOYLE: CYBER-ANTHONY: That... that will be excellent.\nDOYLE: I can, I can hear his voice. He’s telling me you should go into the building. You should find your old family, make them like you.\nDOYLE: CYBER-ANTHONY: They will all be like us. How will I... I enter?\nDOYLE: He’s telling me there’s a window on the first floor. Climb up and enter through that. CYBER-ANTHONY: Understood. (stomps away)\nDOYLE: Soon we will all be like you.\nNATE: Kathy, what if it’s up there?\nKATHY: Think about it logically. It was making Dad do something to the coffins. It'll be downstairs.\nNATE: Peri and Janine are there. They're going to face it?\nKATHY: I think... I don’t think Peri’s the same as she used to be, Nate. I think she’s used to this.\nWOODS: I think they both are. It’s like... it’s like a game for them.\nNATE: A game?\nWOODS: This is what they do.\nNATE: Good for them. I’ll stick to football. Less deadly.\nKATHY: The way you play?\nNATE: Yeah, all right. Here we are, then\nKATHY: Home.\nPERI: Nice.\nDOCTOR: Indeed.\nJANINE: What are we looking for?\nPERI: Alien technology.\nJANINE: Alien technology, she says, like that’s an everyday thing. Peri?\nPERI: What?\nJANINE: You said... you said you’d been to 1985?\nPERI: That’s nothing. I’ve been everywhere.\nDOCTOR: You haven't been to the Ice Caves of Shabadabadon.\nPERI: That’s the next stop, though.\nJANINE: You travel in time?\nPERI: And space.\nJANINE: Oh. You did say you’d been travelling.\nPERI: And I was being a good little girl. It wasn’t a lie.\nJANINE: And this whole time-travel life thing would explain how you know about these Cybermen?\nPERI: Do you believe me?\nJANINE: How. Just tell me how.\nDOCTOR: We don't really have time.\nPERI: Yeah, we do. Mom, when I left you in the hotel, I was all set to go to Morocco with these two guys. I went to see Howard, who abandoned me on the boat, so I decided to swim for it. I got a cramp and nearly drowned, but this guy Turlough rescued me. He took me to the Tardis and when I woke up\nJANINE: Whoa, back up a bit. Tardis?\nPERI: Time And Relative Dimension In Space.\nJANINE: Yeah, and that means?\nPERI: A time machine. A ship that can go anywhere. Anyway, by the time I woke up, we were on our way to this planet called Sarn, and after that I decided to stay with the Doctor.\nDOCTOR: I’ve been trying to get rid of her ever since.\nPERI: Ha, ha. So that’s what happened. That’s why I haven’t been home. That's why I couldn’t send a postcard. That’s why I haven’t been here. Because it’s a time machine, I always figured I could get back before you knew I’d been away.\nJANINE: Is this the truth?\nPERI: What?\nJANINE: Are you telling me the truth?.\nPERI: Yes. I promise.\nJANINE: Okay. Fair enough.\nPERI: I am sorry. I didn’t mean for it to happen like this.\nJANINE: It’s fine, but if this turns out to be some huge practical joke, I am so going to slap you into next week.\nPERI: Nah, I’ve been there already.\nJANINE: (laughs) I can’t believe this.\nDOCTOR: Ah, oh, sorry. I found a radio.\nJANINE: I’m very pleased for you.\nDOCTOR: (sotto) Two Peris for the price of one. (normal) Now, I want to see what’s happening out there.\nPERI: You can tune it into the police radio?\nJANINE: I don’t think so, do you?\nDOCTOR: No. Peri, I’m not a magician. No, I want to listen to the news. This isn’t just about a few dead bodies being converted into Cybermen. They’re not going to stop at that. Ah.\nNATALIE: [OC]: As reported earlier\nDOCTOR: There.\nNATALIE: [OC]: Police have advised that all citizens stay indoors whilst the two men are on the run. Go to your homes and stay there. Look after yourselves and your loved ones. Keep away from public areas, and you will have nothing to fear. I’m Natalie Hamilton and you’re listening to channel VNTR, the news you can trust.\nPERI: Trust. She’s being controlled too, isn’t she?\nDOCTOR: Sounds like it to me.\nJANINE: But why? I don’t understand.\nDOCTOR: Aclimate of fear, Mrs Foster. Keep everyone scared.\nPERI: So everyone'll trust them.\nDOCTOR: Oh, it’s worse than that. If everybody in the Fells Point area is indoors, it makes it so much easier for the Cybermen. You’re scared. The news has told you there’s a murderer on the loose. You stay indoors and you think you’re safe, but then when the Cybermen come for you, you’re trapped.\nPERI: But... but it takes ages to convert someone, remember? People’ll escape, they'll tell others.\nDOCTOR: How long do you think it took them to convert Anthony?\nJANINE: What?\nDOCTOR: Remember, these Cybermen are from the future. Look.\nJANINE: What is it?\nDOCTOR: The most advanced Cyber-technology I’ve ever seen. The subject, the deceased, is placed into the coffin here. See that needle there?\nPERI: It’s tiny.\nDOCTOR: That’s what changed Anthony Chambers. They've developed. They don’t need machines and clunky conversion kits anymore. Just that.\nJANINE: An injection, like a virus?\nDOCTOR: Looks like it.\nJANINE: And you can tell all that just by looking.\nDOCTOR: Can you see anything else that would change a typical dead human into what we saw out there?\nJANINE: Human? You say that like... oh. Of course you are. Welcome to our planet.\nDOCTOR: Oh. Oh, thank you, Janine. Delighted to be here. Well, you know what I\nPERI: Getting back to the point. So, they release the, what, twenty Cybermen here and they go off marching through the suburbs?\nDOCTOR: Where everyone is safely locked indoors.\nPERI: And they just inject them?\nDOCTOR: Mmm hmm.\nPERI: They convert them just like that?\nDOCTOR: Oh, I’d imagine they’d need to kill them first, but you get the gist.\nJANINE: That’s awful. And then?\nDOCTOR: Each family rises from the dead, and they go on marching, their numbers increasing. A new Cyber-race is born.\nPERI: It'll be on the news.\nDOCTOR: Of course it will, and that'll just encourage everyone to stay in their homes.\nPERI: And wait to die. So, we’re about as safe in here as anyone.\nDOCTOR: Looks that way. Come on. I want to see what’s through here.\nJANINE: It’s just the backyard.\nDOCTOR: Ah. Great places to store things, backyards. Come on.\nNATE: Okay, what about the bathroom?\nKATHY: It’s not often you go in there voluntarily.\nNATE: Funny girl.\nKATHY: Ill go check the lounge.\nWOODS: I'll come with you.\nNATE: Mister Woods.\nWOODS: Hmm?\nNATE: Keep an eye on her, won’t you?\nWOODS: Of course. Don’t go so fast, Kathy.\nKATHY: Sorry. Are you okay?\nWOODS: I’m fine. What is it?\nKATHY: I’ve not been in here since, since Dad died.\nWOODS: I’m sorry.\nKATHY: It all looks the same, even though everything’s changed.\nWOODS: Is this your father?\nKATHY: Yeah. That was taken just before my Prom. That’s Dad, me, Nate. Oh, and that one’s me, Peri and some other friends. Candy and Paula.\nWOODS: Happy memories.\nKATHY: Yeah. Yes, and I’m not letting whatever these Cybermen are destroy that.\nWOODS: Quite right. So, you going to university now?\nKATHY: Studying medicine at Boston.\nWOODS: You want to be a doctor?\nKATHY: That’s the plan.\nWOODS: Good plan. I like doctors.\nKATHY: Your wife. What happened to her?\nWOODS: Cancer. Well, she survived that, but then got hit by a bus. But as a clever man pointed out, if it hadn’t been for those doctors, we wouldn’t have had three wonderful years.\nKATHY: I’m sorry.\nWOODS: And it’s the memories, isn’t it? They’re what are supposed to keep you going. But it’s not enough for me.\nKATHY: Is that why, is that why you sleep in the graveyard?\nWOODS: Yes. I suppose you think it’s crazy.\nKATHY: No.\nWOODS: I just... I need to be near her.\nKATHY: It’s difficult to let go, isn’t it?\nWOODS: Yes.\nKATHY: The Doctor’s right, though. They’re gone. My Dad, your wife, they’re gone, and no matter what happens, we mustn't think that these things are them. They're not.\nWOODS: Of course, you're right. Life has to go\nWOODS: Oh, my God!\nNATE: Kathy, what happened?\nKATHY: Dad.\nNATE: Mister Woods?\nKATHY: He’s dead. It just killed him!\nKATHY: CYBER-ANTHONY: There is nothing to fear.\nPERI: What was that? I thought I heard something.\nJANINE: I can’t hear anything over this racket.\nDOCTOR: Why would Anthony have covered the yard in tarpaulin? What do you think?\nJANINE: To stop it getting wet?\nPERI: Listen, I definitely heard something. I'll go and check if the others are okay.\nDOCTOR: Janine, look over there.\nJANINE: There’s something in the corner. What is it?\nDOCTOR: Wait for me.\nPERI: Oh, don’t mind me. You two stay there and enjoy yourselves. I'll just talk to myself. Kathy? Nate? Mister Woods? Hello? You three okay? Hello? Okay, going upstairs would be the stupid thing to do, but I never was the brightest. Yep, Kathy definitely got the brains.\nJANINE: It, it’s alien, isn’t it?\nDOCTOR: Must you sound so surprised?\nJANINE: Whoa, hold it. Must you sound so arrogant?\nDOCTOR: Arrogant? Me?\nJANINE: I’m not my daughter. Wait, where’d she go?\nDOCTOR: Back inside. She'll be fine. Now, what do you make of this?\nJANINE: Well, you’re the expert, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: True. Well, it looks to me like a big white egg.\nJANINE: Hmm. And that’s your expert opinion.\nDOCTOR: I'd say it was some kind of pod.\nJANINE: From space?\nDOCTOR: No, Janine, from Arkansas. Of course it’s from space.\nJANINE: So you think the Cyberman’s inside?\nDOCTOR: I do indeed.\nJANINE: So, we should destroy it.\nDOCTOR: You really are Peri’s mother, aren’t you. Honestly, put that girl near anything remotely unusual or dangerous and she wants to hit it till it stops moving.\nJANINE: You expose my daughter to dangerous... to danger?\nDOCTOR: We'll save that chat for later. Now let’s just concentrate on getting it open.\nJANINE: Oh, looks like we won’t need to bother.\nPERI: Someone’s left a window open. Okay. Hi! It’s me, Peri. I’ve got the Doctor and my Mom with me. And soldiers. Big soldiers, just to let you know. We’re coming in, so er, don’t panic. Hello?\nKATHY: Peri?\nPERI: Oh, my God.\nNATE: It’s Dad.\nPERI: That’s not Anthony. I told you. Mister Woods!\nKATHY: It killed him.\nKATHY: CYBER-ANTHONY: He will become like us.\nPERI: Okay. Okay. Let’s all just stay calm. Kathy, Nate, come towards the door.\nPERI: CYBER-ANTHONY: Katherine, Nathaniel, halt.\nPERI: It knows who you are.\nKATHY: It’s confused. Every time we try and move, it just comes closer.\nNATE: It’s Dad.\nPERI: No! Okay, we need to...\nNATE: Come on, Peri. I thought this is what you did, what you deal with.\nPERI: Yeah, all right. Just give me a minute.\nPERI: CYBER-ANTHONY: You will... you will... Katherine, be like us.\nKATHY: No. No, Dad, don’t.\nKATHY: CYBER-ANTHONY: The dead... dead will walk.\nPERI: That’s it. Okay. Anthony? Mister Chambers, just stay there.\nKATHY: What are you doing?\nPERI: I’ve got it in my bag somewhere.\nNATE: A gun?\nPERI: No! No, here. Okay, just stay calm. Mister Chambers? Okay, I’m just going over here. You know, a bit of TV. Everyone likes TV, yeah? Nate, talk to him.\nNATE: Dad? It’s me, Nate. No. Stay, stay back. Peri’s just going to put on the TV. We can watch... remember that new one? The detectives, Miami Vice? Yeah, we can watch Miami Vice. Remember, it’s always just you and me. That’s it. Kathy’ll just be going to her room. You know what she’s like, always studying. Go on, Kathy, go to your room.\nKATHY: I... Dad?\nKATHY: CYBER-ANTHONY: I, I studied. My pain.\nNATE: Just go. That’s it. You know Kathy, Dad. She hates things like this. Cops with guns. Just you and me, yeah? How’s the VCR, Peri?\nPERI: Just rewinding. There. Mister Chambers, look.\nJANINE: [OC]: Here we are then, Anthony’s big birthday bash!\nJANINE: CYBER-ANTHONY: Party. I no longer require parties.\nPERI: Whoa! No, you do. Remember? That’s my Mom\nANTHONY: [OC]: Stop filming me.\nPERI: And there’s you. Look.\nNATE: Do you see, Dad? That’s who you were.\nJANINE: [OC]: In a mass of nasal hair.\nANTHONY: [OC]: Okay, stop it now.\nNATE: Go make sure Kathy’s okay.\nPERI: I’m not leaving you.\nNATE: Just go. I'll make sure he stays here.\nANTHONY: [OC]: No, no, no, don’t say\nNATE: That’s right, isn’t it, Dad? Just you and me. The boys together.\nANTHONY: [OC]: Just kill me. Kill me now.\nANTHONY: CYBER-ANTHONY: The boys\nJANINE: It’s taking its time.\nDOCTOR: And that’s a bad thing?\nJANINE: I just want to get this over with, take the kids home.\nDOCTOR: And Peri?\nJANINE: Well, I guess that’s up to her.\nDOCTOR: You should be very proud of her, you know. There we go.\nJANINE: It’s dark.\nDOCTOR: I’m going in.\nJANINE: You sure? I can’t see anything in there.\nDOCTOR: No, neither can I.\nKATHY: Doctor.\nJANINE: Oh God.\nKATHY: Sorry.\nJANINE: Okay, just don’t do that again. What is it?\nKATHY: The Cyberman, the one that was Dad.\nDOCTOR: What is it?\nKATHY: It’s here. It killed Mister Woods.\nJANINE: He’s dead?\nDOCTOR: Never mind that. Where is he now?\nJANINE: Never mind the man’s dead? Where’s Peri? Where is she, Kathy?\nPERI: I’m here.\nJANINE: What about Nate?\nPERI: He’s watching the video. Mister Chambers’ birthday.\nJANINE: What?\nPERI: I thought it'd keep the Cyberman confused. It’s just standing there, watching it.\nDOCTOR: Well done, Peri. I’m impressed.\nKATHY: But how long? How long is that gonna work for?\nDOCTOR: Long enough, hopefully.\nPERI: What's that?\nJANINE: A pod, from space. A space pod.\nPERI: Look at you, getting the lingo.\nKATHY: What’s inside?\nDOCTOR: I can’t see. It’s just dark. I’m going in.\nKATHY: One of us should go check Nate, check he’s okay.\nDOCTOR: You said this Cyberman’s confused?\nPERI: Yeah. He can kinda still remember being Mister Chambers.\nDOCTOR: Best to leave them, then.\nJANINE: What?\nDOCTOR: Nate’s a healthy lad. As long as the Cyberman’s occupied, he should be able to get past it. As long as we’re not... I wonder what’s in there?\nKATHY: What if this does take too long? What if you can’t stop it?\nPERI: Then we'll all die anyway.\nDOCTOR: Right, I want you three to go back to the house. Kathy, did you find a room with a lock?\nKATHY: The bathroom.\nDOCTOR: Are you sure?\nKATHY: Yeah.\nDOCTOR: Okay. You three go there. Try and get Nate to join you. Lock the door and try and block it with whatever’s available. I assume there’s a window?\nKATHY: Yeah.\nDOCTOR: Right, I want you to look out of it, and the moment you see the police leave, Peri, I want you to take the others back to the Tardis.\nPERI: But Doctor...\nDOCTOR: Peri, you’ll be safe there.\nPERI: I’m going in there with you.\nJANINE: No, you’re not.\nDOCTOR: Your mother’s right. Now just go.\nPERI: Mom, get off me.\nDOCTOR: (echoing) Oh, it’s bigger inside than... Get yourselves to safety. I'll meet you\nPERI: Doctor! Doctor, let me in! Doctor.\nJANINE: It, it’s gone.\nPERI: Doctor.\nNATALIE: Thank you for joining us. The police are repeating their advice that people living in the Fells Point area stay in their homes. They’re reporting that the two men wanted may be members of a wider network, and that there may, in fact, be a highly dangerous criminal gang operating on the streets of Baltimore. We repeat. Do not go outside. Stay safe.\nANTHONY: [OC]: I said, stop filming me. Go find someone else.\nJANINE: [OC]: Yeah, yeah, yeah. There’s oh! Kathy, Kathy, Katherine. What is it with you guys? Come on, smile for the camera.\nKATHY: [OC]: Not going to. Look, me not smiling.\nNATE: Are you okay, Dad?\nNATE: CYBER-ANTHONY: Boys together.\nNATE: That’s right. Just keep on watching the tape. We'll be fine. The Doctor and Peri are going to make everything okay\nANTHONY: [OC]: Okay, okay, I'll do the speech. Okay, er, firstly\nMRS VAN G: Hello, nurse? Yes, hello. It’s Dominique Van Gysengham. I'd like to speak to my... to my husband, please. Oh, thank you. Hello? Ted? Can you hear me? Can you understand me today? It’s me, your wife. Your wife. Yeah, I know. I know it’s been a while, but have you seen the news? There’s something happening here, and I just wanted to tell you that... that I’m sorry. Sorry for everything that happened, and I, I love you.\nDOYLE: Can you hear the leader’s voice? He says soon we will all be like him. We will all be the ultimate, the perfect, the Cybermen, the future.\nKATHY: Peri, he’ll be fine.\nPERI: I’ve seen them. I’ve seen what they can do. We've got to help him.\nJANINE: Listen, sweetie, there’s nothing we can do. He’s gone.\nPERI: You don’t understand. He’s my best friend!\nKATHY: Oh.\nPERI: Oh God, Kathy, I’m sorry.\nKATHY: No, no, it’s fine.\nPERI: It’s just, if there’s a Cyberman in there, he’s by himself. He could die. I can’t lose him, not again.\nJANINE: Again? What do you mean?\nPERI: He died for me. He gave up his life just for me! Mom, Kathy, he is my best friend. The Doctor, he’s the bravest person I’ve ever met.\nDOCTOR: Hello? Anybody here? I see your pod’s bigger on the inside. That’s not particularly original. Hello?\nCYBERLEADER: Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Is that the Cyber Leader? So nice to hear a familiar voice.\nCYBERLEADER: Keep walking, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Oh, I will. Looking forward to seeing you. My, it is big in here, isn’t it? Still, it’s all good exercise. That’s it. Brisk walk will do me the world of good.\nCYBERLEADER: Keep walking, Doctor. You have found me, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: So I have. Urgh, you’re not looking at your best.\nCYBERLEADER: I am dying.\nDOCTOR: Oh, that’s okay. The dead will walk, and all that.\nCYBERLEADER: Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Yes?\nCYBERLEADER: 8687.\nJANINE: What do you mean, he died for you?\nPERI: He used to be... different.\nJANINE: Nicer?\nPERI: Yeah. I mean he used to be a completely different person. When I met him, he was... sweet.\nJANINE: What happened?\nPERI: I was... I caught Spectrox toxaemia. I was gonna die.\nJANINE: Oh, my God.\nPERI: But he found this antidote. There wasn’t enough for both of us, so he gave it to me and he... he died.\nKATHY: But he’s here. What, he came back to life?\nJANINE: Like a Cyberman?\nPERI: No. Sort of. He’s a Time Lord. They can regenerate, come back to life as someone else. Well, no, no, he’s the same person, he just looks different, acts different. Way different.\nJANINE: Is that why you’re with him, out of guilt?\nPERI: No. No, it’s not like that. We’re friends.\nKATHY: But the way he talks to you, the way you talk to him.\nPERI: That’s just the way we are. We argue, but doesn’t mean we don’t like or love each other. Isn’t that right, Mom?\nJANINE: Yeah. Okay, what if he doesn’t come back? What are we going to do?\nKATHY: This Tardis thing, he said go back to that.\nPERI: Yeah. Yeah, okay. Let’s go upstairs, get Nate, and go to the Tardis.\nKATHY: And Dad?\nPERI: No, Kathy. You have to accept it. He’s gone. Really gone. I’m sorry.\nDOCTOR: 8687? Why do people keep saying that to me?\nCYBERLEADER: That is not my... concern.\nDOCTOR: No, of course it isn’t. So, what are you up to, then? Where are we going?\nCYBERLEADER: We are waiting... waiting... waiting in the Vortex.\nDOCTOR: Oh, not the best place to hang around chatting. So what do you want?\nCYBERLEADER: I am one of the last.\nDOCTOR: Have all the Cybermen finally died? Oh dear. How sad. Never mind.\nCYBERLEADER: The wars have destroyed most of my race. Only a few of us remain.\nDOCTOR: So, a dead race trying to use the dead of the Earth to walk again.\nCYBERLEADER: I will... I will be victorious.\nDOCTOR: No, you won't. I’m going to stop you.\nCYBERLEADER: How, Doctor? You are no longer on Earth.\nDOCTOR: Oh, I’ll find a way. So, this ship. Bigger on the inside?\nCYBERLEADER: It is Time... Time Lord technology.\nDOCTOR: I thought it might be. Where did you get it, then?\nCYBERLEADER: The future, Doctor. Soon you shall see it.\nDOCTOR: Oh, I’ve been there. Bought the t-shirt. Bought the coat. What do you think, hmm?\nCYBERLEADER: Remain still.\nDOCTOR: I don’t think so. Now, what does this switch do?\nCYBERLEADER: It is unimportant.\nDOCTOR: On the contrary, I think it’s most important. This, yes, this is what you’re using to control the police. Nice to have the law on Argh!\nCYBERLEADER: Do not touch it. Remain still.\nDOCTOR: Or you'll kill me? Convert me? Or are you just planning on breaking my arm? Oof.\nCYBERLEADER: Negative. I will kill one of your friends.\nDOCTOR: Oh, we’ve been through this before. You threaten them, I'll agree to help. That’s how it works.\nCYBERLEADER: That is how it used to work. Watch the screen, Doctor.\nNATE: [OC]: You still okay, Dad? Just remember. That's it.\nDOCTOR: Nathaniel?\nNATE: [OC]: Remember how we used to\nDOCTOR: Don’t!\nCYBERLEADER: I need to convince you of my truth.\nDOCTOR: Don’t do it!\nNATE: [OC]: Dad? Dad, just stay there, okay? No, don’t come over to me. Just stay there. CYBER-ANTHONY [OC]: Hold... hold still.\nNATE: [OC]: I can’t. Dad, stay back!\nNATE: CYBER-ANTHONY [OC]: Hold still, please. There is nothing to fear.\nNATE: [OC]: No. Dad, get off me! Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Stop this! Stop this now!\nNATE: [OC]: No Dad, please! Argh!\nNATE: CYBER-ANTHONY [OC]: You will be like us.\nANTHONY: [OC]: I just want to say, keep playing.\nJANINE: [OC]: Keep playing?\nCYBERLEADER: Have I convinced you, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: You. I'll destroy you, I swear! I'll destroy you for that.\nCYBERLEADER: You will not. You will help me. There are three other humans in that building. They will die unless you help me.\nDOCTOR: Help you do what?\nCYBERLEADER: Change the past.\nPERI: Did you hear something?\nJANINE: No.\nKATHY: Nate? Nate!\nPERI: Wait. Wait, hold on. The Doctor said we shouldn't upset the Cyberman. We need to do this slowly.\nKATHY: Nate!\nPERI: Look at me, Kathy. Look at me. We need to take this slowly. We need to be calm and not get ourselves killed, okay?\nJANINE: What's happened to you, Peri? You’re so\nPERI: I’m me. Now, come on. Quietly.\nKATHY: Nate? Nate, can you hear us?\nDOCTOR: Change the past?\nCYBERLEADER: The past, the present, (gurgle) the future.\nDOCTOR: I can’t change history. It’s not, well, it’s not allowed.\nCYBERLEADER: Such rules are meaningless.\nDOCTOR: Well, normally I’d agree with you, but not this time. If I change history, we could all cease to exist.\nCYBERLEADER: I exist. Logically I will continue to do so.\nDOCTOR: What? Now that’s meaningless.\nCYBERLEADER: The universe is chaos, Doctor. We will bring order.\nDOCTOR: Wait a minute. This was all a trap.\nCYBERLEADER: A trap?\nDOCTOR: Of course. Baltimore, Anthony Chambers, the corpses, all of it.\nCYBERLEADER: I knew you would not be able to resist investigating. It is part of your (gurgle) nature.\nDOCTOR: Been studying up on me, have you?\nCYBERLEADER: Yes, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: You tried to kill me. The cyanide in the coffee.\nCYBERLEADER: I knew you would not drink it.\nDOCTOR: Didn’t want to make the trap too obvious.\nCYBERLEADER: Indeed. (gasping gurgles)\nDOCTOR: Nasty. Well, fair play to you. I fell for it. How long were you on Earth?\nCYBERLEADER: Six hundred and thirty... thirty days. You will take me home, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: What happened? Tell me everything.\nCYBERLEADER: I found this machine, the pod, abandoned on a planet destroyed by fire. I used it to travel into the past. Want... wanted to create the new Cyber-race.\nDOCTOR: Oh, but look what happened to you. You weren't protected against the energies of the Vortex, were you?\nCYBERLEADER: I have learnt there is a link between the pod and its user.\nDOCTOR: Paranoid to the last. Ah, thought so. This ship can only be operated by a Time Lord. Well, let’s have a look. Ah ha. You didn’t pilot this ship. You tried to, and ended up back in 1982.\nCYBERLEADER: The pod crash-landed and I was made imperfect.\nDOCTOR: So, how did you take control of Anthony Chambers?\nCYBERLEADER: The human male found the pod.\nDOCTOR: Of course. Daniel said the building had been abandoned before the Chambers’ moved in. Anthony just happened to look in the back yard of an old empty building and found you. Bad luck, Mister Chambers.\nCYBERLEADER: Not luck. Part of the pattern.\nDOCTOR: The what? Oh no, never mind. So what, then. You took control of Anthony using the ear disc things, and got him to do the same to the local authorities, and then you killed him. Why?\nCYBERLEADER: To attract your attention, Doctor. I have accessed the entire Cyber-race’s history. I knew of your female companion, Perpugilliam Brown. I knew of her connection to this city.\nDOCTOR: So you engineered this whole thing? Mysterious death, brainwashed policemen, even Daniel Woods?\nCYBERLEADER: You believe your emotions make you superior. They do not. They make you easier to manipulate. I knew your female companion would be feeling grief and confusion at being returned home. However, I am aware of your need for a human companion. It motivates you.\nDOCTOR: Okay. So you've done all this. Somehow you’ve managed to manipulate all this. I’ve just one question.\nCYBERLEADER: Yes, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Why? Why not just use the virus in the coffins and the brain-washed policemen to take over Baltimore, America, the planet Earth? Wouldn’t that be simpler?\nCYBERLEADER: There is no virus. Anthony Chambers was converted before he was buried.\nDOCTOR: No virus? But the needle in the coffin.\nCYBERLEADER: It was part of the trap. Anthony Chambers was the only Cyberman. I converted him while he was dying. I needed you to consider the situation critical.\nDOCTOR: So there were no other Cybermen. Oh, very clever. Well, I assumed the climate of fear was for the humans’ benefit, whereas actually it was for mine.\nCYBERLEADER: Emotions are a (gurgle) weakness.\nDOCTOR: But why? Why do all this? What do you need me to do?\nCYBERLEADER: I need you to take me back to the beginning. I need you to help me ensure that the human race is all one, all Cyberman.\nPERI: Okay, you two stay back. I’m going in.\nJANINE: I think you’re forgetting who you're talking to.\nPERI: Done this kind of thing before, have you, Mom?\nJANINE: You're not too old for a\nPERI: No, Mom, I am too old. I’m not your little girl any more.\nKATHY: Oh stop it, you two.\nPERI: Come on, follow me. The tape’s stopped.\nKATHY: Nate? (screams)\nCYBERLEADER: There will be no emotion, no fear. You will pilot the pod (gurgle) You will pilot us to the beginning of life on Earth.\nDOCTOR: Must we? I’ve been there a few times now. I wouldn’t want to bump into myself.\nCYBERLEADER: Set the coordinates for prehistoric Earth.\nDOCTOR: No, I can’t. Really, I can’t.\nCYBERLEADER: Then I will order the Cyberman to kill the remaining humans.\nDOCTOR: You can be very persuasive, can’t you. Ever considered a job in marketing? Course laid in, Captain.\nCYBERLEADER: Activate. You will now take the conversion device.\nDOCTOR: This it? Looks like an egg?\nCYBERLEADER: The device splits into... into... into two pieces.\nDOCTOR: Oh, so it does. And er, what, one on each side of the head, like this?\nCYBERLEADER: That begins the conversion process. The human flesh is then turned into Cyber- technology.\nDOCTOR: (Tommy Cooper) Just like that, ho, ho. It’s very advanced, flesh into metal. This what you used on Anthony Chambers?\nCYBERLEADER: Correct. It is Time Lord technology. I adapted it. It is your future, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: I'd rather not know about that, thanks.\nCYBERLEADER: You will convert the first humans. They will then have the knowledge and ability to develop further Cyber-technology. You will leave the device with them and they will convert all life on the planet.\nDOCTOR: So, no homo sapiens.\nCYBERLEADER: From their birth, the human race will be Cybermen.\nDOCTOR: Quite a plan. One question, though.\nCYBERLEADER: One (gurgle) Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Why me? Oh, I realise you needed me to pilot the ship, but why don’t you convert them?\nCYBERLEADER: You are responsible for the final destruction of my race. It is suitable that you create the new Cyber-race.\nDOCTOR: Revenge? Irony? No, no, no. That’s a bit too emotional for you. You really are dying, aren’t you.\nCYBERLEADER: That is correct. I can no longer leave this vessel. I have tried to... tried to link with it.\nDOCTOR: And now you're trapped. But you left it to kill Anthony.\nCYBERLEADER: That was necessary. That was the final... the final act.\nDOCTOR: You mean it took it all out of you. Now there’s irony. By killing that innocent man, you ‘ve sentenced yourself to death.\nCYBERLEADER: That is unimportant. (gurgle) You will change history and then pilot us to our new future. If you do not, I shall give the order for your companions to be eliminated.\nDOCTOR: But if I change the past, they'll never be born at all.\nCYBERLEADER: Then you shall experience no grief. If you do not change the past and we return to the current timeline, I will ensure that their deaths are... emotional. We have arrived.\nDOCTOR: Prehistoric Earth?\nCYBERLEADER: That is correct. You will now leave the pod.\nDOCTOR: And destroy the future.\nKATHY: Nate. Nate.\nPERI: It’s... Kathy, he’s still alive.\nJANINE: That thing, it’s just standing there.\nPERI: Waiting for orders, I bet. Nate, lie still.\nKATHY: Lemme, lemme look.\nNATE: My legs.\nKATHY: No, don’t talk. Stay calm. Just breathe.\nPERI: We need to get him out of here. Carry him to the bathroom.\nKATHY: No, no, he can’t be moved. Lemme have a... oh God. Nate, I’m just going to talk to Janine, okay? You just stay there. That’s it.\nJANINE: What?\nKATHY: His back, it’s broken.\nJANINE: Oh no. Oh my God. I’m so sorry.\nPERI: No. Well, we can er... broken?\nKATHY: Where’s your Doctor now, Peri?\nPERI: What are we gonna do, Mom?\nJANINE: I'll think of something. Just let’s all stay calm. Right, okay, Peri, you talk to Nate. Keep him talking. Don’t let him go to sleep. Kathy, look at me. Kathy!\nKATHY: I’m sorry.\nJANINE: Don't be silly. Right, you’re going to the bathroom, yeah? Just you, all right?\nKATHY: Right.\nJANINE: You’re gonna lock yourself in. Peri? Peri.\nPERI: What?\nJANINE: This Tardis thing, what does it look like?\nPERI: A blue box. British police box.\nJANINE: Okay. And have you got a key?\nPERI: Here. It’s over by the trees at the edge of the graveyard.\nJANINE: Right. Kathy, I want you in the bathroom. Lock yourself in. I’m going to try to get rid of the Cyberman, okay? I'll be sending Peri to join you shortly, but if anything happens before then, you go back to this Tardis and you call the Doctor’s alien friends or something. You get them here to help us, okay?\nKATHY: I can’t just leave.\nJANINE: We can’t move him, and there’s no point in us all being in danger. Now go!\nKATHY: Okay.\nJANINE: Right. Now Peri, why aren’t you talking to Nate? I told you to talk to him. I’m gonna try and well, get rid of the Cyberman.\nPERI: Okay. Nate? Can you hear me? It’s Peri. Nathaniel, listen to me. It’s me, Perpugilliam, remember? Your stupid name, my stupid name. Remember we were going to get them changed?\nJANINE: Anthony.\nJANINE: CYBER-ANTHONY: Anthony Chambers no longer exists. I am a Cyberman now.\nDOCTOR: If I go out there, I destroy everything.\nCYBERLEADER: That is incorrect. You will create order.\nDOCTOR: Why can’t you understand? The human race, the universe, isn’t meant to be logical. Chaos, emotion, that’s what it’s all about. That's life.\nCYBERLEADER: You are incorrect. I have studied Time, and there are patterns.\nDOCTOR: Patterns?\nCYBERLEADER: Patterns throughout Time. The order is hidden, but it does exist. Every aspect of life is part of something greater.\nDOCTOR: Oh great, a Cyberman who want to get philosophical. And what happens to me, when we go back to your glorious Cyber-future?\nCYBERLEADER: I have studied you, Doctor. Your life does not concern you.\nDOCTOR: You’ve an answer for everything, haven't you.\nCYBERLEADER: You will now leave the pod. Take the conversion device.\nDOCTOR: It seems I have no choice.\nCYBERLEADER: That is correct. Soon we shall be home.\nPERI: So, you see, there’s nothing to worry about, because the Doctor can do anything. I know it looks like he’s gone (continues under)\nJANINE: Anthony. Anthony Chambers, can you hear me?\nJANINE: CYBER-ANTHONY: There is nothing to fear.\nJANINE: Who said anything about being scared? This is me you're talking to. Janine Foster. CYBER-ANTHONY: You will be like us.\nJANINE: Listen to me. That's it, look at me. I need you to try and remember who you are, okay? Remember me. Remember your kids. Remember Nate and Kathy, and do you remember Jessica, your wife? CYBER-ANTHONY: Jessica.\nJANINE: That’s right. She died, remember?\nJANINE: CYBER-ANTHONY: It is irrelevant.\nJANINE: No, it’s not. Don’t tell me it’s irrelevant. Remember how it was? You, Jess, me and Paul. You remember Paul, my husband? Paul. You and him always watching your movies. Remember Thursday nights? Paul and Anthony’s movie night. Do you remember movie night?\nJANINE: CYBER-ANTHONY: Bond.\nJANINE: That’s it. The name’s Bond. James Bond. Remember how you both used to get so drunk and you’d come back and the kids would be in bed, and Jess would make you sleep on the sofa and CYBER-ANTHONY: Sleep.\nJANINE: What's that, hun? You wanna sleep? Well, why don’t you? Why don’t you just go to sleep there. This is your home. You can sleep here..\nJANINE: CYBER-ANTHONY: Sleep.\nJANINE: That’s it. Go to sleep. Okay, Peri? I want you to get ready to join Kathy.\nPERI: Mom? I wish Dad was still here.\nJANINE: I know. I wish Dad was here too. I do miss him, you know. I always have.\nPERI: I’m sorry. Sorry I’ve been so bad about it all. So bad to you.\nJANINE: It’s okay. Now go lock yourself in the bathroom.\nPERI: Nate? You’re gonna be okay.\nJANINE: That’s it. Just quietly leave.\nJANINE: CYBER-ANTHONY: No.\nJANINE: No, it’s okay, Anthony. You stay there.\nJANINE: CYBER-ANTHONY: The young female must not leave.\nPERI: Mom?\nJANINE: Anthony, stand still. Stay where you are. Peri, just go.\nJANINE: CYBER-ANTHONY: No!\nPERI: Get off me! Let me go!\nJANINE: Let her go!\nJANINE: CYBER-ANTHONY: She will be terminated.\nCYBERLEADER: Doctor.\nDOCTOR: It’s done.\nCYBERLEADER: How many? How many did you convert?\nDOCTOR: Eight. And they’re already converting the others.\nCYBERLEADER: You left the device (gurgle) with them?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Yes. Now, let’s go. Let’s see your glorious future.\nCYBERLEADER: Use the panel to your right. Set the temporal coordinates.\nDOCTOR: 1984. A world where everyone conforms. No emotion, no chaos. The Orwellian nightmare come true. That’s it, we’re on our way.\nCYBERLEADER: Excellent. The patterns will be complete.\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nCYBERLEADER: You have created a new history, Doctor. You should feel pride.\nDOCTOR: Pride? How can I feel pride when I know that once I could have stopped your race ever being created? I could have stopped all this ever happening. We've arrived.\nCYBERLEADER: The future, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Well, why don’t you go out there and embrace it? You'll have enough energy for that. And I’m sure their perfect Cyber-technology can fix you up, make you better.\nDOCTOR: Here we are, 1984.\nCYBERLEADER: It is (gurgle) perfect. The logic, the pattern, is complete.\nDOCTOR: You know, I'd love to stay and find out more about this patt... ow!\nCYBERLEADER: You will stay, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: My arm!\nCYBERLEADER: You will stay, Doctor. Look at the future.\nDOCTOR: You really should get yourself looked at. You’re not sounding too healthy.\nCYBERLEADER: It is... itis... Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Oh, that’s better. What is it, Cyberleader? What have you seen? Surely not imperfection?\nCYBERLEADER: These Cybermen, they are... they are... inferior.\nDOCTOR: You all are. Welcome home, Cyberleader. Enjoy your future, what's left of it. Goodbye and good riddance!\nCYBERLEADER: What are you? Why are you (gurgle) inferior?\nCYBERMAN: You are defective.\nCYBERLEADER: Affirmative. I need repairs. You are inferior.\nCYBERMAN: Negative. We are the Cybermen.\nCYBERLEADER: Is this... is this... is this 1984?\nCYBERMAN: Affirmative.\nCYBERLEADER: Is this... is this Earth?\nCYBERMAN: It is Mondas. Commander Zheng, you will take this unit for reprocessing.\nZHENG: Affirmative.\nCYBERLEADER: Negative.\nJANINE: Peri!\nJANINE: CYBER-ANTHONY: Termination aborted.\nPERI: Mom?\nPERI: CYBER-ANTHONY: Awaiting further instructions.\nJANINE: Oh God, Peri, I thought I’d lost you.\nDOCTOR: Lose Peri in that get-up?\nPERI: Doctor! You're alive!\nDOCTOR: Of course I am. Now what’s happening with the Cyberman?\nPERI: He’s waiting for further orders.\nDOCTOR: He'll be waiting for a while, then. The Cyber-Leader’s no longer here. Look out the window and you'll see a group of confused policemen wondering what they’re doing standing about a graveyard.\nPERI: Where’s the, the Cyber-Leader?\nDOCTOR: I took him home.\nPERI: Home?\nDOCTOR: He though I'd changed Earth’s history and brought him back to a new timeline, one where none of you would have existed. Just a planet full of Cybermen. I just adjusted the spatial coordinates slightly and took him back to Mondas.\nPERI: But that’s... not destroyed until 1986!\nDOCTOR: Exactly. Right time, wrong place. Oh, and he gave me this.\nJANINE: What is it?\nKATHY: Is it all over?\nPERI: Yeah.\nDOCTOR: Kathy! This, Janine, is an egg.\nJANINE: Hmm. Your expert opinion?\nDOCTOR: It’s from my future. Converts humans into machines. The Cyber-Leader wanted me to use it to convert the first humans. Peri, hold onto it for me. Oh, Nathanial. I’m so sorry.\nNATE: Doctor.\nDOCTOR: You're alive! He’s alive!\nPERI: His back, Doctor. Is there anything you can do?\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry, Peri. I can’t. We'll get him to a hospital, though.\nJANINE: Then it’s really all over?\nDOCTOR: Yes, Janine. It’s all over.\nPERI: This egg conversion thing, can I keep it? I can put it in the basement, you know, along with Mom’s new space pod. It'll be safe down there, away from prying eyes.\nDOCTOR: Oh, stand back.\nNURSE: That’s it, Mrs Simpson. Keep breathing. In, out. You’re doing great.\nDOCTOR: Ah, new life. It’s a wonderful thing.\nPERI: Yeah. Mom? Kathy?\nKATHY: There’s not much they can do. He’s paralysed.\nPERI: Oh God. I’m so sorry.\nJANINE: But he’s alive, Kathy.\nDOCTOR: And where there’s life.\nKATHY: Oh, Janine, I need to get out of here.\nJANINE: Of course. Come on. Peri? Doctor?\nPERI: Give us a few minutes. We'll see you back at the house.\nJANINE: Okay, we'll see you then.\nDOCTOR: You didn’t want the long goodbye, then.\nPERI: No.\nDOCTOR: Where first? Back to the Gogglebox, or... Peri? Peri, what is it?\nPERI: (crying) I’m not... I’m not coming with you. I’m staying here, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: What?\nPERI: I can’t. I can’t leave them again.\nDOCTOR: But, but, but the Ice Caves of Sha...\nPERI: I’m sorry but no. I’ve made up my mind.\nDOCTOR: You'll... you'll miss me.\nPERI: And you'll miss me too.\nDOCTOR: Peri, are you absolutely sure?\nPERI: Sorry, Doctor, but look me up, yeah? Come back and see me. Right now you... you brought me home.\nDOCTOR: Peri.\nDOCTOR: ALAN5B6: Doctor, welcome back.\nDOCTOR: Ah, hello, Alan. How are you?\nDOCTOR: ALANS56: Fine. Your companion not with you?\nDOCTOR: Er no. No, no, she’s... home.\nDOCTOR: ALAN56: I suppose you want us to help you find that book.\nDOCTOR: It doesn’t seem important now.\nDOCTOR: ALAN56: No?\nDOCTOR: I'll tell you what, though. Show me to one of the booths. I want to see how she gets on. Oh, she'll be brilliant, but that’s only to be expected. After all, she’s learnt from the best. ALAN56: Of course. Follow me.\nJANINE: You okay, honey?\nPERI: Yeah. I just... I can’t believe I’m back. For good.\nJANINE: I’m so happy. Really, it’s so good to have you here.\nPERI: Yeah, it’s good. It’s good to be home.\nPERI: ALAN56: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: No! Peri!\nDOCTOR: ALAN56: Doctor? Doctor!\nMRS VAN G: Hello? Anyone home?\nJANINE: Mrs Van Gysengham?\nMRS VAN G: That’s right, dear.\nJANINE: Oh, I’m just upstairs.\nMRS VAN G: You been abandoned again?\nJANINE: No, no. Peri’s enrolling at Uni and Kathy’s visiting Nate.\nMRS VAN G: Ah ha. A perfect opportunity to snoop.\nJANINE: No, no. You know what girls are like. There’s a whole load of dirty laundry up here. Oh.\nMRS VAN G: What is it?\nJANINE: I found something. It was the Doctor’s.\nMRS VAN G: The British guy?\nJANINE: Yeah, yeah. It’s alien.\nMRS VAN G: Oh, is it.\nJANINE: Turns flesh into metal.\nMRS VAN G: Oh, does it?\nJANINE: Yeah. I'd left it in the basement, though. What do you think?\nMRS VAN G: It’s very pretty. It’s like half an egg.\nJANINE: Yeah. I wonder where the other bit is? Oh, what’s CYBER-DEVICE: Unauthorised use of conversion device. Self-destruct programme activated.\nJANINE: Oh, that doesn’t sound\nNATALIE: There’s been a massive explosion in the Fells Point area. Police are treating it as suspicious. The dead women have been named as Janine Foster and Dominique Van Gysengham. Friends and neighbours have been paying their respects.\nPERI: (crying) Mom? I don’t know what to say to you. You’re probably up there now, laughing at me. My Perpugilliam with nothing to say. I still don’t believe it. One minute you’re there and then... oh God. Mom.\nDOCTOR: (sotto) Peri.\nPERI: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: It’s me. I am so sorry.\nPERI: She’s gone. Just gone.\nDOCTOR: There’s nothing I can say. No words.\nPERI: Kathy’s just disappeared, and Nate, they said he’d been transferred, and I don’t understand what’s happened. I don’t understand.\nDOCTOR: Neither do I, Peri. The universe is chaotic, a mystery.\nPERI: It’s almost like the Cyberman had the right idea. They don’t... don’t have to go through this.\nDOCTOR: Shh. Don’t think like that. You mustn’t.\nPERI: I know.\nDOCTOR: There, there. There, there.\nPERI: I can’t stay here. There’s nothing for me.\nDOCTOR: I know. I know. Come on. Come on, come on.\nTEGAN: Travelling with the Doctor’s the strangest, maddest experience. One minute your life is small, nine to five, next you’re seeing, well, everything, and it’s terrifying, but brilliant. Then one day, like all things, it ends. You leave him, you go home, and everything’s small again. But you get used to it. And the last thing you ever, ever expect, is for him to come back."
