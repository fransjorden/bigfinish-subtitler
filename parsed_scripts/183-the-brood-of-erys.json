We have materialised in a random part of Space/Time so that I can recalibrate the TARDIS systems. It needs doing, it’s been a long time.\nFLIP: Why somewhere random?\nDOCTOR: Because, Miss Jackson, when materialising at an arbitrary location the TARDIS conducts a far range scan to pinpoint its position.\nDOCTOR: (CONTINUED) Like so, excellent. Then we move to another random point and take a further reading. By comparing the two sets of data we can assess the accuracy or otherwise of the TARDIS’s chrono-spatial placement.\nFLIP: Kind of like when you first set up a wireless controller for a\nFLIP: games console?\nDOCTOR: When you first set up a - ?

One planet?\nDOCTOR: It’s rare but not unique. No, what’s odd is that the scan shows there is a ring of radio beacons surrounding this system.\nFLIP: I can’t see any.\nDOCTOR: Oh they’re far from here, about a hundred and fifty million miles out.\nFLIP: A hundred and fifty million??\nDOCTOR: That’s less than half the distance from your world to Jupiter.

But can you remember your name?\nSARRA: My name... Sarra. My name is... Sarra. Yes, I’m sure.\nDOCTOR: Sarra who?\nSARRA: Sarra.. I don’t know. Just Sarra. Why can’t I remember?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 31\nDOCTOR: Amnesia, presumably. There’s no sign of head trauma but that’s not exclusively a cause...\nSARRA: I’m scared. I can’t remember anything. Anything.\nDOCTOR: Nothing at all?\nSARRA: I don’t know who I am. I don’t know my full name, I don’t know why I was on a space yacht, I don’t know where I come from... I remember nothing!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 32\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE _ 17. ERYS — MAIN CHAMBER.\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: A SPACIOUS INTERIOR ACOUSTIC WITH A SLIGHT ECHO. A DANK SPACE, FLUID DRIPPING FROM THE WALLS IN PLACES.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE DRACHEE ENTER, THEIR FEET MOVING ON A SOFT DAMP FLOOR,\nDRAGGING: FLIP, STILL IN HER VACUUM CLOAK. )\nDRACHEE: (MUTED DRACHEE CHATTERING, HEARD INTERMITTENTLY BEHIND THE FOLLOWING)\nFLIP: (APPROACHING, STRUGGLING WITHIN THE CLOAK) Let. Me. Out!\nTERRILL: (APPROACHING) All right, here.\nTERRILL: (FX: THE VACUUM CLOAK IS RIPPED OPEN, FLIP FALLS TO THE WET GROUND, HITTING WITH A SQUELCHING THUD. )\nFLIP: Eugh! What’s this? Is this mud?\nTERRILL: Get up.\nFLIP: (RISING) That was my plan.\nTERRILL: This will be your home from now on.\nFLIP: A cave? A cave covered in goo? It’s not exactly ‘Grand Designs’.\nTERRILL: Such a brave little girl.\nFLIP: Why did you bring me here?\nTERRILL: For fun.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 33\nFLIP: Okay. Creeping me out now.\nTERRILL: You can always try to leave.\nFLIP: Eh?\nTERRILL: That tunnel is the way out. On you go. None of us will stand in\nTERRILL: your way.\nFLIP: This is a trick.\nTERRILL: You can try to leave, or you can stay.\nFLIP: Okay then.\nFLIP: (CONTINUED) It’s dark along there...\nTERRILL: Tunnels usually are. Hide all sorts of things. Are you going or\nTERRILL: aren’t you?\nFLIP: Oh I’m going all right.\nFLIP: (FX: FLIP TAKES A COUPLE OF STEPS AWAY FROM US, THEN HALTS.\nFLIP: A SUDDEN ANIMAL HISS CLOSE BY, FOLLOWED BY AN INSECTOID RATTLE AND THE CLITTER-CLATTER OF FAST APPROACHING GIANT ARACHNID LEGS.\nFLIP: THE HISS AGAIN, MUCH CLOSER. THIS THING IS BEARING DOWN US.)\nFLIP: (CRIES OUT) No!!!\nTERRILL: Well well. The brave little girl is afraid of spiders.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 34\nFLIP: A spider twice the size of me, yeah!\nFLIP: (FX: THE GIANT SPIDER HISSES AND CLITTER-CLATTERS, INCREDIBLY CLOSE. )\nFLIP: Get it away from me!!!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 35\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 18. EXT. ASPHYA — A FIELD.\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: EXTERIOR ACOUSTIC. AN OPEN SPACE, A BREEZE BLOWING, LEAVES RUSTLING IN NEARBY TREES.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TARDIS MATERIALISES. ITS DOOR OPENS.)\nDOCTOR: (EMERGING) Are you well enough to walk?\nSARRA: (EMERGING) I’m fine. I’m just bruised, a few cuts. Where’s this?\nDOCTOR: The planet Asphya, according to the Drachee. Emergency dematerialisation brought us to the nearest land mass. Rustically charming, isn’t it?\nSARRA: It’s a charming enough field. Wait a minute. Your ship. The inside was... But the outside is...\nDOCTOR: Well spotted. But a discussion for another time. Sarra. Asphya, does the name mean anything to you?\nSARRA: Should it?\nDOCTOR: You came here in that ship. Presumably for a purpose.\nSARRA: No. Asphya doesn’t mean anything to me.\nDOCTOR: Shame. I was hoping the association might trigger a memory.\nSARRA: This is frightening. I remember nothing of my life before you saved me. I feel... hollow. How can I have no memory?\nDOCTOR: It could have been caused by the attack on your ship. The effects of extreme shock.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 36\nRENVAL: (FROM MIDDLE DISTANCE) You there!\nDOCTOR: Oh. Hello.\nRENVAL: (APPROACHING) Your faces aren’t known to me.\nDOCTOR: We are visitors.\nRENVAL: You are from the Great Darkness?\nDOCTOR: The Great Darkness?.. Ah. If you mean outside this system, then yes.\nRENVAL: We don’t have visitors on Asphya. It’s not allowed.\nDOCTOR: Not allowed? By whom? The Drachee?\nRENVAL: You know the Drachee?\nDOCTOR: A brief acquaintance. They kidnapped a friend of mine. What can you tell me about them?\nRENVAL: It isn’t safe here. We should get indoors. My village is nearby. We can talk there.\nSARRA: Why isn’t it safe?\nRENVAL: The Drachee might come. They see us from the sky. Come, quickly.\nDOCTOR: Let’s go with him.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 37\nDOCTOR: (CONTINUED) I’d like to know everything you can tell me about these Drachee. They live on your moon, yes? The moon Erys?\nRENVAL: Erys is more than just a moon.\nDOCTOR: Stop.\nRENVAL: Yes?\nDOCTOR: My friend might be up there. What do mean, more than just a moon? Is she in danger?\nRENVAL: If your friend is on Erys, she is in the most terrible danger.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 38\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 19. ERYS — MAIN CHAMBER.\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: THE GIANT SPIDER, CLOSE AND THREATENING, ALL HISS AND CLICK-CLACK. )\nFLIP: Get back! Get... back!!\nDRACHEE: (FX: SUDDENLY, THE SPIDER VANISHES. ALL SOUNDS AND MOVEMENTS STOP. )\nFLIP: (RECOVERING) What... ?\nTERRILL: It wasn’t real. We placed it in your mind.\nFLIP: But... I could feel it. I could feel its legs on me.\nTERRILL: If we had wanted, you would have felt its jaws close on you.\nFLIP: That’s cruel.\nTERRILL: You see now? You aren’t going anywhere.\nERYS: (ANDROGYNOUS, REVERBERATING, ALL AROUND.) Enough.\nFLIP: Who’s that?\nTERRILL: (COWED) We were only having a bit of fun with her.\nERYS: You could have broken her mind. And she is of value. Child? I apologise for your treatment. My Drachee are high spirited.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 39\nFLIP: Your Drachee? Look this is an awkward conversation when I can’t even see you. Why don’t you come out?\nERYS: But you can see me.\nFLIP: I can?.. Where?\nERYS: I am all around you. You are within me. I am Erys. I am the chamber you are standing in, and everything on this world. I am the living moon.\nFLIP: You’re the moon??\nERYS: And the Drachee are my children.\nEND: TITLES.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 40"

A special man. The Doctor.\nFLIP: Why are you like this? Why attack us? Why keep me prisoner?\nERYS: I act to defend myself and my children. Over the millennia many have come here. They came to lay claim to me and to Asphya. They came with plots to slay me or enslave me, to mine the minerals from my carcass, and take my children.\nFLIP: Do you attack every ship that comes here?\nERYS: To protect my brood. Any ships that come close are a potential threat. The mining cartels of the neighbouring systems have tried many subterfuges to land their people here.\nFLIP: Those neighbours of yours have put up warning beacons to keep people away.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 48\nERYS: Good. I want nothing to do with the people of other worlds. And I don’t want my Drachee having anything to do with them either.\nFLIP: If you can read my thoughts then you know I don’t mean you any harm. Hang on — you said you saved me for two reasons. What’s the other one?\nERYS: The second is that you are to be integrated.\nFLIP: Integrated? What’s that?\nFLIP: (FX: THE GROUND STARTS TO MOVE. SLIMY MUSCULAR ORGANIC MATERIAL\nSHIFTING: WETLY. RIPPLING. SUCKING. )\nFLIP: (CONTINUED) I’m sinking .. What are you doing?!\nERYS: You should not struggle. You cannot fight it. You are being drawn down into me.\nERYS: (FX: THE SUCKING SLURPING PULL OF THE ORGANIC FLOOR EXERTS AN\nEVEN: STRONGER FORCE, DRAGGING FLIP DOWN INTO A FISSURE OF FLESH. )\nFLIP: (STRUGGLING) I’m not going to be your dinner!\nERYS: You have a purpose more useful than as food. It will be painless, if you do not resist.\nERYS: (FX: FLIP IS SCRABBLING AT THE FLOOR AS SHE IS DRAGGED DOWN, NOW AT SHOULDER DEPTH. BUT HER FINGERS CAN’T GET PURCHASE ON THE SLICK SLIMY SURFACE. )\nFLIP: (STRUGGLING AGAINST THE SUCTION, AND FOR BREATH) Can’t.. get a grip. NO! (MUFFLED AS SHE GOES UNDER) No!..You don’t need to do this! NO!!\nFLIP: (FX: FLIP FULLY SUBMERGES.

ASPHYA — A COUNTRY PATH.\nDOCTOR: (APPROACHING) Here we are.\nDOCTOR: We must hurry. The more I hear about Erys the more worried I become for Flip.\nRENVAL: I’m sorry I cannot come with you, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Oh, Renval. Of course you must stay here with your people. In fact I’m not sure it’s a good idea for you to come, Sarra. (BEAT.) Sarra?\nSARRA: (A SHORT DISTANCE AWAY) That moon up there. That creature. There’s something... Something tugging at my memory.\nDOCTOR: A memory of Erys?\nSARRA: I don’t know. But I’m going with you, Doctor. I have the strongest feeling that I’1ll find some answers up there.\nDOCTOR: If you’re sure... In you go.\nDOCTOR: Renval, thank you for your advice. It will be invaluable.\nRENVAL: Just keep yourself alive, Doctor. And keep your mind intact.\nDOCTOR: I’ll certainly try. Goodbye for now.\nDOCTOR: (FX: THE DOCTOR ENTERS THE TARDIS, THE DOOR CLOSES.

THE FLOOR AGAIN IS ORGANIC AND DAMP. )\nTERRILL: (APPROACHING) Yes, brothers and sisters, I know. It is unfair.\nTERRILL: Our captive taken from us. To be integrated, when we could have learned from her. She could have told us of those other worlds\nTERRILL: that our parent is so keen we should know nothing about.\nTERRILL: We have often discussed how we are tired of being tied to the parent, of being forbidden even to talk of other worlds. Well I tell you that soon we will find a way to leave. The blue box would have been ideal. But there will be other opportunities.\nTERRILL: Whether the parent likes it or not, we will go. We will explore. We will make a new life, where it is we who make the decisions for ourselves.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 52\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 25.

Not much to her, is there?\nDRACHEE: 2: (APPROACHING) She’ll do. She’s in one piece at least.\nFLIP: (RISING TO HER FEET) What is this place?\nDRACHEE: 1: This is where we does the preparing.\nDRACHEE: 2: You’re going to be prepared.\nFLIP: Prepared for what?\nDRACHEE: 1: Enough talking. Get yourself over there, by the tank.\nFLIP: What’s that in it? Looks like... eugh.\nDRACHEE: 1: Never you mind what it is. You’re getting in it.\nFLIP: I’m not!\nDRACHEE: 1: Ha. That’s what they all say. “No no, please don’t put me in there! Don’t put me in the tank!” (LAUGHS)\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 53\nDRACHEE: 2: ‘Course in the end, they don’t have a choice.\nDRACHEE: 1: (MENTAL PROJECTION ) No choice at all.\nFLIP: (CRIES OUT IN PAIN, FIGHTING THE MENTAL COMMAND, BEHIND THE\nFOLLOWING: )\nDRACHEE: 1: (MENTAL PROJECTION) Get in the tank, girl.\nDRACHEE: 2:\nDRACHEE: You won’t drown.

Won’t.\nDRACHEE: 1: (MENTAL PROJECTION) You're fighting it well. Some do.

But it doesn’t matter, there’s nowhere she can hide. It’s only a matter of time before they pick her up and bring her back.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 55\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 26. INT.

This is the most amazing machine I’ve ever travelled in.\nDOCTOR: The TARDIS would thank you for saying so. And I tell you what, she has a wardrobe down the corridor. Those clothes you’re wearing are torn from when your ship was attacked. There’s time for you to change.\nSARRA: These’1ll do for now. I checked the pockets to see if I was carrying anything that might give me a clue to who I am.\nDOCTOR: You had no luck, I take it?\nSARRA: There’s this pendant, but that’s just a stone on a chain. It doesn’t suggest anything to me.\nDOCTOR: And that’s all-?\nSARRA: Seems like it —\nSARRA: (FX: SHE PATS HER CLOTHES WITH HER HANDS AS SHE SPEAKS, AND NOW HALTS. )\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 56\nSARRA: Hang on. What’s this?\nDOCTOR: What?\nSARRA: There’s something here, under the pocket, in the lining of my trousers.\nDOCTOR: In the lining?\nSARRA: I can feel its outline. A small square of something. It must have been stitched in there.\nSARRA: (CONTINUED) It’s a phototablet... Why would I — ? Oh.\nDOCTOR: What’s the photograph?\nSARRA: Two children. Girls. No older than eleven or twelve. Cute things. Blonde. (A SUDDEN GASP, THE SHOCK OF REALISATION)\nDOCTOR: Sarra??\nSARRA: They’re my children! They’re my daughters!\nDOCTOR: You remember?\nSARRA: I’m a mother! I’m a mother to... Jen and Mya. That’s who they are — Jen and Mya! Oh Gods, how could I have forgotten I was a mother?\nDOCTOR: And why did you have a phototablet of them hidden in the lining of your trousers?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 57\nSARRA: It makes no sense.\nDOCTOR: What else can you remember? Do you know where you’re from? Do you remember their father?\nSARRA: I don’t... I can’t...\nELGIN: (RADIO FILTER - IN SARRA’S HEAD) Stop!!\nSARRA: (FRIGHTENED) What? Who’s that?\nELGIN: (RADIO FILTER - IN SARRA’S HEAD) Remember nothing else!\nDOCTOR: Sarra, what are you talking about?\nELGIN: (RADIO FILTER - IN SARRA’S HEAD) You have a purpose here. You have a plan. Stick to the plan.\nSARRA: Who are you? Where are you? What plan?\nDOCTOR: Sarra, who are you talking to?\nSARRA: Can you hear that?\nDOCTOR: Hear what?\nELGIN: (RADIO FILTER - IN SARRA’S HEAD)\nELGIN: Do not let this Doctor know you can hear me. It could ruin everything. Trust me. You know you can trust my voice. You know this.\nSARRA: It was.. nothing. Just talking to myself.\nDOCTOR: Let me have a look at you.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 58\nELGIN: (RADIO FILTER - IN SARRA’S HEAD)\nELGIN: Do not trust him. Trust only my voice.\nSARRA: I’m not crazy.\nDOCTOR: I’m not suggesting you are.\nSARRA: Have we arrived?\nDOCTOR: Yes, but I really think you should let me examine — [you]\nSARRA: (COLLECTING HERSELF, CALMING DOWN) No. We have to get out there\nSARRA: and find your friend.\nDOCTOR: Of course. Just let me know if you feel unwell.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 59\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 27. EXT. ERYS — SURFACE.\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: A BLEAK LANDSCAPE. THERE IS A WIND LIKE A WHISPERED WAIL. THE GROUND IS HARD AND GRITTY UNDERFOOT.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE TARDIS DOOR OPENS. THE DOCTOR AND SARRA STEP OUT.)\nDOCTOR: Welcome to Erys. Not the most hospitable of environments.\nSARRA: Is that the sound of the creature?\nDOCTOR: That’s the wind. It makes that sound as it passes through those fissures in the surface. Unsettling, isn’t it?\nSARRA: This is really a living being? It looks like... well, it looks like a planet should look. It has geological features. Hills, cliffs, even vegetation. The ground is solid.\nDOCTOR: Living planets are a mixture of flesh and mineral, encased within a solid carapace. Be grateful for it. It means the creature is unlikely to realise that we’re here. And the other features are growths that have developed on the carapace.\nSARRA: And the vegetation?\nDOCTOR: Fungus.\nSARRA: Oh nice.\nSARRA: (FX: THE DOCTOR CLOSES THE TARDIS DOOR AND STRIDES OFF, BEHIND THE FOLLOWING. )\nDOCTOR: But come on. We have to find Flip, and to do that we’ll have to find some way of communicating with this creature. We should look for a way underground.\nSARRA: We'll find a way if we head for the cliffs.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 60\nDOCTOR: Will we? How do you know?\nSARRA: (CONFUSED) I.. I don’t know why I said that. It just came to me.\nDOCTOR: You know this place?\nSARRA: No... I don’t know. Maybe. But how could I?\nDOCTOR: It’s possible. In fact, it might offer an explanation for your amnesia. If you’ve met the Drachee before and they’ve affected your mind.\nSARRA: That’s an unpleasant thought.\nSARRA: (CONTINUED) Maybe I have been here before. The hills look familiar. And I have an impression of... caves? Openings in the cliff face at ground level.\nDOCTOR: Nothing’s visible from this distance. But we’ll soon see. There’s a fair distance to — Hello, what’s this?\nSARRA: The remains of some kind of machine?\nDOCTOR: It’s been taken apart. Violently. By the Drachee no doubt.\nDOCTOR: (CONTINUED) This looks like a CPU.\nSARRA: CPU?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 61\nDOCTOR: Central Processing Unit. The key component of a computer. And over there is a motor. Pieces of caterpillar track. A camera. There’s circuitry everywhere.\nSARRA: What is it? Was it?\nDOCTOR: A robot of some kind, I'd say. Fairly basic, with telemetry. It would have been controlled remotely.\nDOCTOR: Sarra?\nSARRA: I’m remembering...\nDOCTOR: What?\nSARRA: A place. A world. Two suns in a blue sky. A large city. Silver towers, by the ocean...\nELGIN: (RADIO FILTER - IN SARRA’S HEAD) Enough!\nDOCTOR: Sarra? What’s wrong?\nELGIN: (RADIO FILTER - IN SARRA’S HEAD) Memories are breaking through. You must resist them.\nSARRA: I.. Nothing’s wrong, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Are you sure?\nSARRA: I’m sure.\nELGIN: (RADIO FILTER - IN SARRA’S HEAD) Remember no more. It is dangerous. Move on.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 62\nSARRA: We should move on.\nDOCTOR: One moment.\nDOCTOR: (FX: THE DOCTOR STARTS SIFTING THROUGH METAL PANELS AND CIRCUIT BOARDS ON THE GROUND. )\nDOCTOR: (CONTINUED) This is odd.

That is brave.\nTERRILL: And over there, his blue ship. (LAUGHS) We will have it for ourselves after all. Forward, but softly. Go to ground. Keep low, use the fissures to hide. We will have the element of surprise.\nTERRILL: (FX: TERRILL AND HIS DRACHEE MOVE AWAY, LOW ON THE GROUND, SCRAPING THE HARD SURFACE WITH THEIR LIMBS AS THEY CRAWL AND SLIDE. )\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 64\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 29.

(CONCENTRATING, ACCLIMATISING).. Yes. I am Drachee, and I am called... Lona.\nFLIP: What was that all about? What were you doing in the wall?\nLONA: This is the birthing flesh. I am newborn.\nFLIP: Newborn?\nLONA: From the flesh of Erys. Nurtured in the membrane until mature as you see me now.\nFLIP: This is how Drachee are born?\nLONA: All Drachee are made this way.\nFLIP: Are we going to be friends?\nLONA: Friends?\nFLIP: Well you haven’t tried to hurt me. Yet. Or throw me in a tank full of gloop.\nLONA: You.. You are to be integrated.\nFLIP: Oh no.\nLONA: (MENTAL PROJECTION ) You must be integrated.\nFLIP: Ah! (BRACES HERSELF FOR THE PAIN OF MENTAL COERCION, BUT IT DOESN'T COME) Hey. You’re not doing it.

Hello. Sarra, let me introduce Terrill and his Drachee siblings.\nSARRA: These are Drachee?\nTERRILL: You were lucky before, Doctor. But this time you will give us your ship.\nDOCTOR: We've had this conversation. It didn’t end well for you.\nTERRILL: We want a star ship. We need a star ship. We will have yours. It’s special. None has survived an attack before.\nDOCTOR: You’re not having it. Now tell me, where is Flip?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 68\nTERRILL: You are strong of mind, Doctor. You were victorious before, and I don’t intend to try you again. But I am prepared to break the mind of this female unless you give us your ship.\nDOCTOR: Don’t threaten me. Answer my question. Where is Flip? What have you done with her?\nTERRILL: We have done nothing. (A LIGHT LAUGH) It is the parent who has integrated her.\nDOCTOR: Integrated?\nTERRILL: I will ask only once more, Doctor. Will you give us your ship?\nDOCTOR: What do you mean, ‘integrated’?\nTERRILL: She has become part of the parent. (MENTAL PROJECTION) As will this one. (STRAINS WITH MENTAL EFFORT)\nSARRA: Are you trying to hurt me?\nTERRILL: (MENTAL PROJECTION) (STRAINING) Brothers. Sisters. Join me.\nDRACHEE: (MENTAL PROJECTION )\nTERRILL: (MENTAL PROJECTION) This isn’t possible. Why does she not respond?\nDOCTOR: She has no memories.\nTERRILL: (BREAKS OFF HIS EFFORT, RECOVERS FROM THE STRAIN) No memories?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 69\nSARRA: I have almost no recollection of who I am, creature.\nDOCTOR: You play with the fear centres of the brain, don’t you? You identify and grotesquely amplify those things that have caused a person fear in their past. But Sarra has no memories like that.\nTERRILL: It’s a trick.\nDOCTOR: She’s immune to you.\nTERRILL: What is she? What are you?\nDOCTOR: Is Flip still alive?\nTERRILL: (COWED) Integration doesn’t kill. She lives.\nDOCTOR: You had better be telling the truth. Take me to her.\nTERRILL: Only the parent can tell you where she is. Only Erys.\nDOCTOR: Then take me somewhere where I can communicate with Erys.\nTERRILL: You can speak with the parent. Come.\nDOCTOR: (QUIET) Stay alert, Sarra. They’re tricky.\nSARRA: (QUIET) They seem harmless when they can’t use their mind games.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 70\nDOCTOR: Don’t you believe it.

It requires a psychic connection with a Drachee. It is also not made for long distance travel. You are flying out into space. You will keep going.

You imagine also that you may persuade me to stop my children from entertaining themselves with the inhabitants of Asphya. In both these things you will be disappointed.\nDOCTOR: I’m impressed. Very few telepathic beings are able to read a Time Lord’s mind.\nERYS: I can read only the most prominent thoughts in your mind. The rest of you is closed to me.

Expelled\nERYS: into space.\nDOCTOR: No...\nERYS: You will spend the rest of your life here.\nERYS: SCENE 33. [CONTINUOUS]\nDOCTOR: Erys, there’s no need for this.\nERYS: Silence! Terrill, place them both against the wall.\nTERRILL: Yes, parent. (TO DOCTOR AND SARRA) Over there.\nTERRILL: Both of you. Hands against the wall.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page\nSARRA: I’m scared.\nDOCTOR: Be brave.\nTERRILL: They are ready.\nERYS: Do not move, either of you.\nSARRA: (DISGUSTED CRY) What’s it doing?!\nDOCTOR: Don’t panic. It’s only covering our hands and feet. It’s the same secretion Erys used to cover the bomb.\nSARRA: But why?\nDOCTOR: I imagine it sets like concrete. It’s one way of keeping your prisoners where you can see them, I suppose.\nERYS: Correct, Doctor.\nSARRA: I feel it setting around my hands already.\nDOCTOR: Not the most dignified of restraints.\nELGIN: (RADIO FILTER - IN SARRA’S HEAD) Sarra? Sarra, what’s happening? Are you all right?\nSARRA: That voice again. I don’t know who you are! How are you speaking to me?\nELGIN: (RADIO FILTER - IN SARRA’S HEAD) I can’t explain. Not yet. It’s not safe.\nELGIN: 79\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 80\nERYS: I detect a micro audio transceiver that has been surgically implanted in the canal of your right ear.\nSARRA: Surgically implanted??\nELGIN: (RADIO FILTER - IN SARRA’S HEAD) Sarra, you have to get yourself out of there. I can’t come to\nELGIN: get you.\nSARRA: Whoever you are, help me, please!\nELGIN: (RADIO FILTER - IN SARRA’S HEAD) I wish I could.\nERYS: I can feel the device with my mind. I can also crush it.\nELGIN: (RADIO FILTER - IN SARRA’S HEAD) Sarra? Sarra, be brave. Be —\nELGIN: [FX: A BRIEF BURST OF STATIC CUTS HIM OFF, THEN THERE IS SILENCE.

THE ENGINES ARE STILL THROTTLING, THRUSTING THE SKIMMER THROUGH SPACE AT GREAT SPEED.\nFLIP: IS TRYING VARIOUS SWITCHES AND BUTTONS. )\nFLIP: Oh come on. One of these has to be a steering control.\nFLIP: (CONTINUED) Or a radio! Hello? Hello? Can anyone hear me?\nFLIP: (CONTINUED) Anyone? This is Flip Jackson. Hello? Mayday! SOSI!... Help!\nFLIP: (CONTINUED) I’m stuck on a spacecraft that I can’t steer. I’m heading into — [space]\nFLIP: (CONTINUED) Oh great. And now I’ve run out of fuel. I’m drifting! Can anyone hear me?\nFLIP: (CONTINUED) Oh Flip. This doesn’t look good.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 82\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 35. INT. ERYS — MAIN CHAMBER.\nDOCTOR: Sarra?\nSARRA: (RECOVERING) I’m all right. A pain in my ear. Gone now. The voice has stopped.\nDOCTOR: Erys, can’t you see? This woman had no control over her actions. She was clearly in an hypnotic state. She is being used by others!\nERYS: I see you were unaware of her intentions, Doctor. But nonetheless you brought her here. You endangered me and my children.\nSARRA: Is it.. is it going to kill us?\nERYS: I will defend myself and my brood. I do not yet know what I’1l1 do with you. You are not suitable for integration.\nDOCTOR: What is ‘integration’? Is that what happened to Flip? I demand to know — [where she is]\nERYS: You will demand NOTHING! Do not provoke me.\nTERRILL: Shouldn’t have sent his blue ship away.\nERYS: What did you say, Terrill?\nTERRILL: (NERVOUS) I said, you shouldn’t have got rid of his TARDIS.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 83\nTERRILL: That ship was special. We could have learned from it. We could have used it.\nERYS: I will not encourage learning of alien ways.\nTERRILL: But it’s not fair, we could — [learn from them]\nERYS: No more of this! Get out! Get out, all of you! It’s time for your nutrition cycle. Go.\nTERRILL: (SULKING) We’re going.\nDOCTOR: Nutrition cycle?\nERYS: You will be silent. I am scanning space to see if there are friends of this woman nearby. More of the cartel’s agents.\nSARRA: (WHISPER) Doctor. What if there are others here with me?\nDOCTOR: (WHISPER) If there are, I think they’re in trouble.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 84\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 36. INT. ERYS — TUNNEL. (FX: ECHOING, DANK, A TRICKLE OF FLUID FROM THE WALLS. TERRILL AND THE DRACHEE ARE WALKING TOWARDS US.)\nTERRILL: (APPROACHING) Hello, what’s this?\nTERRILL: (CONTINUED) We have a new sister, it seems. Wake up, sister.\nLONA: (REVIVING FROM UNCONSCIOUSNESS AS TERRILL SHAKES HER.) Hmm? What?\nTERRILL: I’m Terrill. Has the parent given you a name yet?\nLONA: (DROWSY) I am called Lona.\nTERRILL: Welcome, Lona. How long since your birthing?\nLONA: An hour. Maybe more.\nTERRILL: You need a nutrition feed. Come with us. There’s a nutrient chamber near here that we’re heading for. We’ll get you some clothes on the way.\nLONA: (STANDING) I was tired from exertion. There was an alien girl. We fought.\nTERRILL: The Doctor’s friend. Where is she?\nLONA: Dead now. Probably. She took a skimmer.\nTERRILL: Not good for anyone but a Drachee, our skimmers.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 85\nLONA: She knows that now. Too late of course.\nTERRILL: Come on, newborn. Let’s get you some nutrient before you fall\nTERRILL: over again.\nLONA: Lead and I will follow, Terrill.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 86\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 37. INT. ERYS — MAIN CHAMBER.\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: WE ESTABLISH THE AMBIENCE OF THE CHAMBER. THERE IS A TRICKLE OF AN OOZING SUBSTANCE CLOSE TO US.)\nDOCTOR: Erys? (PAUSE) Erys, can you hear me?\nSARRA: Has it gone?\nDOCTOR: Perhaps it can’t concentrate on more than one thing at a time.\nSARRA: Meaning?\nDOCTOR: If it’s mentally scanning nearby space, this chamber has probably become part of its subconscious.\nDOCTOR: (FX: THE DOCTOR TWISTS HIS HAND WITHIN THE LUMP OF HARDENED SECRETION. THERE IS A SLIGHT CRACK IN THE ROCK-LIKE SUBSTANCE. )\nDOCTOR: (CONTINUED) If it’s distracted for just a little while longer, that might give us a chance to (EFFORT OF TWISTING HIS HAND IN\nITS: CONFINEMENT) get out of here.\nSARRA: You moved your hand!\nDOCTOR: (EFFORT OF WORKING HIS TRAPPED HAND FREE) The secretion around my left hand didn’t settle as thick as the rest. It’s still... brittle.\nDOCTOR: (FX: THE HARDENED MATERIAL CRACKS WIDE OPEN, PARTS OF IT FALL TO THE FLOOR. )\nDOCTOR: Ha! Done it! One hand free at least.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 87\nSARRA: But the rest is set like stone.\nDOCTOR: As is so often the case, I have an idea.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 88\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 38. INT. SKIMMER.\nFLIP: (TIRED NOW) Anyone? Hello? Can anyone hear me?\nELGIN: (RADIO FILTER) Hello? Unidentified caller on this channel, can you hear me?\nFLIP: (SUDDENLY ALERT) Yes! Yes I hear you! Hello!\nELGIN: (RADIO FILTER) Who are you and what are you doing in this system? Don’t you know how dangerous this area is?\nFLIP: Tell me about it. Look, my name’s Flip. I’m on a small ship, a skimmer, and there’s no power.\nELGIN: (RADIO FILTER) Keep calm, Flip. I’m tracking your radio transmission, I’1l soon have you on my detectors.\nFLIP: You have a ship?\nELGIN: Big enough to fit you in the cargo hold.\nFLIP: Don’t be long. And hey, who are you?\nELGIN: (RADIO FILTER) My name’s Elgin. Elgin Vanser. And I’1ll be as quick as I can.\nFLIP: Quick as you like, Elgin.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 89\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 39. INT. ERYS — MAIN CHAMBER.\nSARRA: What are you doing?\nDOCTOR: (EFFORT OF STRETCHING OUT) If I can reach over to this trickle of fresh secretion... (STRETCHES FURTHER)... nearly there...\nDOCTOR: (FX: THE DOCTOR GATHERS A HANDFUL OF THE GOO FROM THE SLOWLY\nTRICKLING: SUPPLY.)\nDOCTOR: (CONTINUED) Eurgh. Disgusting, but fresh. Just what we need.\nSARRA: Is it?\nDOCTOR: If I pour it over the hardened secretion on my trapped hand...\nDOCTOR: (FX: THE SECRETION GLOOPS AS THE DOCTOR POURS IT FROM HIS HAND ONTO THE HARDENED LUMP AROUND HIS OTHER HAND. )\nDOCTOR: (FX: THE DOCTOR GATHERS FURTHER SECRETION, WHICH THEN ALSO\nGLOOPS: AS HE ADDS IT TO THE FIRST. )\nDOCTOR: Give it a little time to work... (EFFORT OF PULLING HIS TRAPPED HAND)... I think it might be working.\nSARRA: What’s working?\nDOCTOR: The fresh secretion is warm. It’s acting on the hardened lump around my hand, transferring its warmth and softening it. (PULLS ON HIS HAND) Yes, it’s definitely becoming pliable. One determined... Pull!\nDOCTOR: (FX: THE DOCTOR’S HAND COMES FREE. THIS TIME WITH A SOFTER EFFECT, AND THE RELEASE OF SUCTION. HE’S PULLING HIS HAND FROM\nSOFT: MATTER. )\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 90\nDOCTOR: Ah-ha! Success!\nSARRA: That’s brilliant!\nDOCTOR: We must hurry. Erys’s consciousness could return at any time.\nDOCTOR: (CONTINUED) I’ll free my feet, then I’1ll get you out of there.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 91\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 40. INT. ELGIN’S SHIP — CARGO HOLD.\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: A LARGE METAL-FLOORED SPACE. THE AIR IS BEING PRESSURISED; AS THE RUSH OF OXYGEN STOPS, AN ELECTRONIC TONE DENOTES THAT THE PROCEDURE IS COMPLETE.\nDOCTOR WHO: A DOOR HUMS OPEN, FOOTSTEPS ENTER. )\nELGIN: (APPROACHING) The cargo hold is pressurised, Flip. You can get out now.\nELGIN: (FX: THE SKIMMER CANOPY OPENS UP. FLIP CLIMBS OUT, SPEAKING AS\nSHE: DOES SO.)\nFLIP: Elgin. You’re a star. I was sure I was a goner then.\nELGIN: You’re so young. What are you doing here?\nFLIP: Short version — Kidnapped by aliens, spoken to by a moon, swallowed by the ground, ran away, stole one of their skimmers.\nELGIN: You were on Erys? Were you with Sarra?\nFLIP: Who’s Sarra?\nELGIN: She is my daughter.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 92\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 41. INT. ERYS — TUNNEL\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: THE DOCTOR AND SARRA ARE MOVING ALONG THE WET FLOOR, CAUTIOUSLY. )\nDOCTOR: Keep an ear out for Drachee.\nSARRA: Where are we going?\nDOCTOR: First we’ll look around for my friend, Flip. Then we’1ll see. We may find a weak point in Erys.\nSARRA: If it has one.\nDOCTOR: There are vulnerable points in every living being. You almost exploited one yourself.\nSARRA: I did?\nDOCTOR: You didn’t throw that pendant bomb aimlessly. It was a relatively small charge, it needed to be targeted.\nSARRA: So?\nDOCTOR: You threw it towards an exposed nerve junction. If the explosion hadn’t been contained it would have seriously disrupted Erys’s nervous system. It would have gone into neural shutdown for a considerable period of time. Days, most likely.\nSARRA: It wouldn’t have killed it?\nDOCTOR: Living planets aren’t easy to kill. No matter how determined you are.\nSARRA: But why did I do it?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 93\nDOCTOR: Perhaps you really are working for one of these corporations. But I somehow doubt it.\nSARRA: And who was that man who spoke to me?\nDOCTOR: He’s another cause for hope. He knows you’re here. Maybe he’1l\nDOCTOR: come to rescue you.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 94\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 42. INT. ELGIN’S SHIP — FLIGHT DECK.\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: A ROOMY COCKPIT. VARIOUS INSTRUMENTS IN AUTOMATIC OPERATION. IN THE BACKGROUND, THE SPACECRAFT’S ENGINES ARE RUNNING.\nDOCTOR WHO: A DOOR HUMS OPEN. FLIP AND ELGIN ENTER. )\nELGIN: (ENTERING) Out of the question.\nFLIP: But she’s your daughter.\nELGIN: Don’t you think if there was any chance of me getting in there to rescue her I would? Erys would destroy this ship before I got near the planet.\nFLIP: But I’ve got to get back there! You said the Doctor’s with her. I’ve got to help him.\nELGIN: It’s madness to even think about it. We should go, and try to persuade the authorities to return with us.\nELGIN: (FX: ELGIN IS INTERRUPTED BY A SUBTLE ALARM ON THE INSTRUMENT PANEL. )\nFLIP: What’s that?\nFLIP: (FX: ELGIN WORKS SOME INSTRUMENTS, THE ALARM CUTS OFF. HE HITS\nFURTHER: SWITCHES. )\nELGIN: There’s an object nearby. Meteorites usually. I don’t think — oh hang on. That’s odd.\nFLIP: What is it?\nELGIN: The strangest thing. Floating across our path. Some kind of blue box.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 95\nFLIP: (DELIGHTED) Elgin. We might not have to leave after all.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 96\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 43. INT. ERYS — NUTRIENT CHAMBER.\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: A CHAMBER WITHIN ERYS FULL OF BUBBLING POOLS OF LIQUID NUTRIENT. THE DRACHEE ARE FEEDING, CUPPING THE NUTRIENT TO THEIR MOUTHS AND DRINKING IT DOWN. )\nTERRILL: (WHILE DRINKING) This is your first nutrient feed. You will need to feed well, build up your energy.\nLONA: (DRINKING) I am aware, Terrill.\nTERRILL: I remember my first feed. That was a long time ago.\nLONA: How long?\nTERRILL: (PROUD) I have almost six years.\nLONA: That is old.\nTERRILL: You’ve fed enough. You’1ll be fine now. (TO THE ROOM) All of\nTERRILL: you, finish up. We’re going back.\nLONA: You act like a leader.\nTERRILL: They listen to me.\nLONA: The parent doesn’t like leaders among the brood.\nTERRILL: Maybe the parent is naive. Come on, let’s go.\nTERRILL: (FX: TERRILL, LONA AND THE DRACHEE LEAVE THE CHAMBER. THE NUTRIENT CONTINUES TO BUBBLE. )\nDOCTOR: (APPROACHING) You can come out now. They’ve gone.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 97\nSARRA: (APPROACHING) This is where they eat, then? From pools of... I’m not sure what to call it.\nDOCTOR: It’s not the most appetising of delicacies, but this liquid provides them with all the nutrition they need. There’s a fascinating biological cycle at work here. Oh hello.\nSARRA: What?\nDOCTOR: There are some other organic tubes here. They grow from out of the nutrient pools, and they go back into the floor.\nSARRA: Is that significant?\nDOCTOR: They’re carrying nutrient, but they’re taking it from the pools and feeding it elsewhere. Somewhere down below.\nSARRA: Nutrient for the Erys creature itself.\nDOCTOR: But Erys is already providing the nutrient that flows into these pools. Like milk for its young. There would be no need to feed off it itself.\nSARRA: What, then?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know. It’s curious.\nSARRA: Interesting, but do you think we should get out of here?\nDOCTOR: Perhaps you’re right. Yes. For now. We’1ll head for the surface.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 98\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 44. INT. ELGIN’S SHIP — CARGO HOLD.\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: FLIP AND ELGIN CROSS THE METAL FLOOR OF THE HOLD AND STOP. )\nELGIN: This is really your ship? This blue box can fly?\nFLIP: Yeah. (DISPIRITED) But I can’t fly it. Only the Doctor can. He gave me a key, I can get in, but that’s it.\nELGIN: (THOUGHTFUL) There might be a way. If you were inside it, and secured yourself, I could eject it from the hold ona trajectory that would return it to Erys.\nFLIP: Would that work?\nELGIN: It would be a fine calculation, and you’d be taking your chances with the landing, but I don’t see why not. If it was free falling and not powered I don’t think Erys would notice Tt.\nFLIP: rm up for. it.\nELGIN: I’1ll want you to take a message to my daughter.\nFLIP: What message?\nELGIN: Tell her that her father loves her. And that she has to leave now. Our plan has failed. We will return, but for now we have to go.\nFLIP: What plan?\nELGIN: I can’t tell you any more. If you knew, Erys would know. And that would put everything and everyone in danger.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL)\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 45. INT. ERYS — MAIN CHAMBER.\nTERRILL: Where are the outsiders?\nLONA: They’ve gone. How is this possible??\nTERRILL: Parent! Parent, speak to us! (PAUSE.) Parent!\nLONA: We must act on our own initiative.\nTERRILL: We must hunt them down.\nTERRILL: Page 99\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 100\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 46. INT. TARDIS CONTROL ROOM. (FX: AMBIENCE OF THE TARDIS AT REST.\nFLIP: IS FASTENING A HARNESS TO THE CONSOLE (AS PER TIMELASH EPISODE ONE). )\nELGIN: (RADIO FILTER) Flip, can you hear me? You’re not too cramped inside there?\nFLIP: No it’s, um, roomier than you’d think.\nELGIN: (RADIO FILTER) I’ve come closer to Erys than I’m comfortable with, I’d like to get away. Are you ready?\nFLIP: Just attaching a safety harness to the console. The Doctor showed me how to do this. Fiddly as a deck chair, but...\nFLIP: (CONTINUED)... Done. (DEEP REASSURING BREATH) I’m ready.\nELGIN: (RADIO FILTER)\nELGIN: The computer prediction says this will take you on a course to impact close to the point on Erys where I last heard from Sarra.\nFLIP: (WORRIED) Impact?\nELGIN: (RADIO FILTER) Em. Land.\nFLIP: That’s better. (BRACES HERSELF) Okay. Go.\nELGIN: (RADIO FILTER) See you soon, Flip. Initiating explosive decompression, cargo doors opening... now.\nELGIN: (FX: OVER THE RADIO LINK WE HEAR THE OUTRUSH OF AIR CAUSED BY THE IMMEDIATE DECOMPRESSION OF THE CARGO HOLD. )\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 101\nFLIP: (SCREAMS LIKE IT’S THE START OF THE WORLD’S MOST THRILLING THEME PARK RIDE) Here I come, Doctor!!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 102\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 47.

THE SHIP’S ENGINES SURGE, PEAK AND STALL. )\nELGIN: The engines won’t start!\nERYS: (MENTAL PROJECTION ) You are too late to run.\nERYS: (FX: THE HULL CREAKS AND BUCKLES AS ERYS DEMONSTRATES ITS POWER. )\nELGIN: Let my vessel go!\nERYS: (MENTAL PROJECTION ) (CONTINUED) What are you and the woman doing here?\nELGIN: (MENTAL STRUGGLE) No... I will not...\nERYS: (MENTAL PROJECTION ) Foolish man. You cannot hide your thoughts... aah, I see now. So that is your purpose? How surprising.\nELGIN: We had no choice.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL)\nERYS: (MENTAL PROJECTION ) No choice but to kill me?\nELGIN: What have you done with my — ?\nERYS: (MENTAL PROJECTION ) I have learned enough.\nERYS: (FX: FURTHER PRESSURE ON THE HULL,\nARE: ELECTRICAL EXPLOSIONS. )\nELGIN: Page 103\nWHICH: BUCKLES FURTHER. THERE\nWHICH: My ship! You’re destroying my ship!!!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 104\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 48. INT.

Can you hear that?\nSARRA: (FX: DISTANT BUT COMING NEAR, FROM INSIDE THE CAVE SYSTEM THE CRY OF DRACHEE ON THE CHARGE. )\nDOCTOR: Drachee. Coming this way. We need to get out of here.\nDOCTOR: (CONTINUED) (RUNNING) We might stand a chance if we can get to those hills and out of sight!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 105\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 49.

Come on TARDIS!!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 106\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 50. EXT. ERYS — SURFACE.\nSARRA: (RUNNING) The Drachee. They’ve seen us!\nDOCTOR: (RUNNING) Keep going!\nSARRA: (RUNNING) I don’t know if I can keep up... (SHE SLOWS) Wait. What’s that in the sky? Is that your — ?\nDOCTOR: - My TARDIS! Yes!\nDOCTOR: (CONTINUED) It’s not flying. It’s falling!\nDOCTOR: (FX: THE TARDIS HITS A HILLSIDE IN THE MIDDLE DISTANCE AND\nTUMBLES: DOWN. THE SOUND OF IT TUMBLING CONTINUES BEHIND THE FOLLOWING. )\nSARRA: Not much of a landing. It fairly crashed into that hillside.\nDOCTOR: It’ll come to a halt at the foot of the hill. Come on!\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 107\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 51. EXT. ERYS — HILLSIDE. (FX: THE TUMBLING TARDIS SLEWS TO A HALT.

Wonderful to see you!\nFLIP: Want to climb in?\nDOCTOR AND SARRA: Hurry up! Those Drachee will be on us at any moment. (EFFORT OF\nCLIMBING: INTO THE TARDIS)\nTERRILL: (CRY OF FRUSTRATION) (RECOVERING FROM RUNNING) I wanted that ship!!\nLONA: (RECOVERING FROM RUNNING) You wanted it?\nTERRILL: Maybe they didn’t go far.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 108\nLONA: Where are you going?\nTERRILL: You'll see.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 109\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 52. INT. TARDIS CONTROL ROOM\nFLIP: That was close.\nSARRA: You look in pretty good shape for someone who just crashed into a hillside.\nDOCTOR: The advantages of a dimensional interface. The interior of the\nTARDIS: counteracts the worst of the effects on the exterior. But you weren’t to know that, Flip. I’ve told you before, young lady: think before you act!\nFLIP: It was pretty good fun. Until the landing.\nDOCTOR: You call that a landing?? .. But how did you get here? And in the TARDIS?\nFLIP: I made a new friend. Sarra, I have a message for you.\nSARRA: A message?\nFLIP: From your dad.\nFLIP: He said... well, that you loved you.\nSARRA: My father?\nFLIP: Yeah... And he said you have to leave here. He said the plan has failed.\nSARRA: What plan? I don’t know anything about a plan.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 110\nFLIP: He said he couldn’t tell me, because if I knew then Erys would know if it read my mind.\nSARRA: My father...\nDOCTOR: He must have been the person communicating with you.\nSARRA: Where is he?\nFLIP: Close. He has a ship. But he’s had to keep his distance from Erys.\nDOCTOR: I’m sure we can answer all this in time. But now we’re leaving. After one short stopover.\nFLIP: A stopover? Where?\nDOCTOR: Asphya. It’s too dangerous here for Renval and his people. I\nDOCTOR: need to persuade them to evacuate in the TARDIS.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL)\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 53. EXT. ASPHYA — VILLAGE STREET.

Calm down!\nRENVAL: There is no need to be afraid!\nDOCTOR: (EMERGING) Renval. Just the man we needed to see.\nRENVAL: Doctor! Is this the friend you went to Erys for?\nFLIP: (EMERGING) Nice to meet you. I’m Flip.\nSARRA: (EMERGING) Good to see you again, Renval.\nDOCTOR: There’s not much time. Erys is a dangerously unstable creature. I implore you, let me take you and your people away from here\nDOCTOR: in my TARDIS.\nRENVAL: In... this?\nDOCTOR: It will surprise you.\nRENVAL: This is our home, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: And you live here under the shadow of a constant threat.\nRENVAL: It is all we know.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 112\nDOCTOR: Let me address the village. Let me put my case to your people, and then they can decide.\nRENVAL: Even if they said yes, how many could you possibly take in this... box?\nDOCTOR: Let me show you. Would you like to come in?\nRENVAL: If it’s safe...\nDOCTOR: Of course. (ENTERING THE TARDIS) Follow me.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL)\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 54. INT.

Allow me to present to you...\nDOCTOR: Renval!\nFLIP: (ENTERING) What happened?\nDOCTOR: He collapsed.\nFLIP: What was it? Shock at seeing the TARDIS?\nDOCTOR: No, it’s something else. Help me carry him out.\nDOCTOR: Page 113\nDOCTOR: (FX: THE DOCTOR AND FLIP LIFT RENVAL BETWEEN THEM AND DRAG HIM\nDOCTOR: TOWARDS THE DOOR. )\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 114\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 55.

In fact, yes.\nRENVAL: (MOANS, MAKING A RAPID RECOVERY) What happened?\nDOCTOR: You passed out.\nRENVAL: Passed out?\nDOCTOR: As soon as you entered the TARDIS.\nRENVAL: Why?\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry, Renval. I don’t think you can ever leave Asphya.\nRENVAL: What do you mean?\nVILLAGERS: (SCREAMS) Drachee! Drachee!\nSARRA: The Drachee are coming, Doctor. A group of them.

That won’t work. They’d all have the same reaction as Renval.\nFLIP: Eh?\nFLIP: (FX: THE SKIMMERS SWOOP DANGEROUSLY CLOSE OVERHEAD. VILLAGERS\nCRY: OUT IN REACTION. FURTHER SKIMMERS SWOOP PAST.)\nDOCTOR: (FIGHTING THE DRACHEE INFLUENCE) The Drachee are playing with your mind, Flip! You can fight it!\nSARRA: Doctor, it’s not just Flip. It’s everyone. The entire village is on its knees.\nRENVAL: Doctor! Doctor .. They are placing demons in our minds... ! (CRIES IN PAIN)\nRENVAL: (FX: NEARBY, SEVERAL SKIMMERS LAND, THEIR CANOPIES OPEN.\nBEHIND: )\nDOCTOR: This is monstrous.\nRENVAL: (IN PAIN) Help us!\nDOCTOR: I don’t know if I can.\nTERRILL: (APPROACHING) Stay away from your TARDIS, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Terrill. You have to stop this.\nTERRILL: It will continue. Until and unless you surrender your TARDIS to us.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 116\nLONA: (APPROACHING) I’m sure you know that Terrill means what he says, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: You know me, but we’ve not been introduced.\nLONA: Have we not?\nTERRILL: Doctor... ?\nDOCTOR: Very well. Yes. The TARDIS is yours. Stop this!\nTERRILL: But of course.\nTERRILL: That wasn’t so difficult, was it? Shall we enter my TARDIS?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 117\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 56. INT. TARDIS CONTROL ROOM. (FX: AMBIENCE OF THE TARDIS AT REST.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE DOCTOR, TERRILL, LONA AND THE DRACHEE ENTER. THE DRACHEE\nSWARM: AS EAGERLY AS BEFORE, CHATTERING IN THEIR EXCITED WAY,\nONCE: MORE LIKE CURIOUS CHILDREN. )\nTERRILL: You will take us wherever we wish to go, Doctor. We will keep you on a tight leash. No tricks from you, understand?\nDOCTOR: Very clear.\nTERRILL: Where shall we go first?\nLONA: You did not discuss this, Terrill.\nTERRILL: Of course I didn’t discuss it with a newborn. Your role is to do what we tell you to do, new one.\nTERRILL: (HIT, HE CRIES OUT AND GOES DOWN, WHIMPERING) What... ?\nLONA: You foolish thing. And the rest of you. All fools. I am not one of you. I am Erys. This Drachee was formed not just from the flesh but with the mind of Erys imbued in it. So that I could walk with you, determine your intentions, confirm whether my suspicions were correct. And they are.\nERYS: (SPEAKING THROUGH LONA) You. Are. UNGRATEFUL! And you would\nDESERT: ME!\nTERRILL: (ABJECT) Parent. No! We would not do that.\nLONA: (HER OWN VOICE AGAIN — MORE CONTAINED) Outside. All of you. Now. You too, Doctor.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 118\nDOCTOR: As you Say...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 119\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 57.

IT IS A HARBINGER OF MORE TO COME FROM ASPHYA’S NATURE.\nTREES: THE OCCUPANTS OF THE TARDIS EMERGE. )\nFLIP: (RAISED VOICE ABOVE THE WIND) Doctor, what’s happening?\nDOCTOR: Lona is Erys.\nFLIP: Erys? How’s that possible?\nDOCTOR: Trust me. It’s possible.\nLONA: This moment marks a new beginning. For everyone here. I have\nLONA: been too indulgent. Too forgiving.\nRENVAL: Please, we have nothing to do with this.\nLONA: Silence! You have served your purpose, but it is over.\nRENVAL: Purpose...\nRENVAL: Lhe)\nDOCTOR: Erys. Please. Don’t.\nLONA: You guess the truth, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Renval collapsed when he entered the TARDIS. I presume because there was a signal that was sustaining him. A signal that was broken by the TARDIS environment.\nLONA: Correct.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 120\nDOCTOR: One that emanates from off this world. From the moon. From you. The Asphyans have life because you give it to them.\nRENVAL: This makes no sense to me.\nDOCTOR: What I don’t understand is why.\nLONA: This is a small system, with no other life forms to interact with. My Drachee needed a distraction.\nDOCTOR: A distraction?! You did this to provide a distraction??\nLONA: They needed amusement, and others to interact with. And so I gave them the people of Asphya. I made these people.\nFLIP: Made them?\nRENVAL: She speaks madness.\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry, Renval. You and your people are avatars.\nRENVAL: Avatars?\nDOCTOR: Shells, your bodies sustained by life energy from Erys.\nLONA: They are the creation of the stuff of these worlds, held together by my will.\nRENVAL: I refuse to believe this.\nLONA: And can be dissolved by my will.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 121\nDOCTOR: Erys — No!\nRENVAL: (CRIES OUT IN PAIN AS HE DISINTEGRATES TO NOTHING) No please! What is this? Noooo... ! Doctor?...\nRENVAL: (FX: ACCOMPANYING RENVAL’S CRIES, THE DISINTEGRATION OF HIS BODY. RAPID DEGENERATION, UNTIL HE COLLAPSES AND FULLY DECAYS ONTO THE GROUND. )\nLONA: How easily he is returned to the stuff of the soil. Now for his friends.\nTERRILL: You take them all away from us... ?\nDOCTOR: There was absolutely no need for that. The entire village?\nLONA: There was every need! All of this is taken! Now look to the moon. Look at Erys!\nFLIP: Doctor, the moon. It’s... rippling.\nFLIP: (FX: A DISTANT MUFFLED BOOM, AS A HUGE FORCE IS GENERATED FROM ERYS. )\nDOCTOR: Erys has generated a pressure wave! Everyone — get down!!\nLONA: (FX: THE PRESSURE WAVE FROM ERYS HITS THE PLANET AS AN INSTANT\nGALE: FORCE HURRICANE, BOOM! TEARING UP HOMES AND SOIL AND TREES AND ROCKS. BOOM! HOMES ARE SWEPT AWAY. THE STORM CONTINUES BEHIND THE FOLLOWING. )\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 122\nFLIP: (SCREAMING ABOVE THE STORM) Doctor!!\nDOCTOR: Hang on, Flip! Keep hold, Sarra!!\nSARRA: I’ll try!!\nLONA: I take these avatars. I destroy their dwellings. I ravage this land. And now... (LAUGHS)\nDOCTOR: (SHOUTING TO BE HEARD) And now, what?\nLONA: And now, to impose my will, I create new beings. Creatures. From the mud and clay of the ground. Who know only one thing. To do as I command.\nFLIP: Doctor — look!\nFLIP: (FX: CLOSE BY, THE GROUND SPLITS.

Or their captured life essence.\nSARRA: (A SUDDEN RECOLLECTION) People...\nLONA: This is what it means to be integrated.\nFLIP: Eh? (ANGER RISING) You were going to ‘integrate’ me. Was that going to be me? Locked up somewhere acting like a.. battery or something?\nLONA: That’s a good enough description.\nFLIP: (FURIOUS) I should knock your — [head off]\nDOCTOR: Flip.\nFLIP: (RELENTS, CALMS DOWN) Okay, okay.

What do you plan to do with us?\nERYS: There is the matter of the attempt on my life.\nDOCTOR: Ah, Erys. The real you. I see Lona appears to have taken a nap. So it’s one of you or the other, is it?\nERYS: I can displace my conscious being. But even I cannot be in two places at once.\nDOCTOR: Oh, quite. But as to your point about the attack on your life, I have to tell you that wouldn’t have been fatal.\nFLIP: Doctor? Sarra doesn’t look well.\nDOCTOR: Sarra?\nSARRA: (PAINED) My head. I feel... there are memories, on the tip of recollection... I can’t get to them.\nERYS: I think I might have the answer you want.

Do you know this poor man?\nFLIP: Yes, it’s — [her father]\nSARRA: I know him.\nDOCTOR: You do?\nSARRA: I.. I think I do.\nELGIN: (WEAK, BUT HAPPY AT HER RECOLLECTION) Hello Sarra.\nSARRA: You're... Wait. Flip said she met my —.. Yes. I remember. I remember of course I do! Father!\nELGIN: (WINCES, BUT CAN’T DISGUISE HIS HAPPINESS) Easy, girl. Got a few bruised ribs from what that thing did to my ship.\nSARRA: Oh father. It’s good to see you! But what is this all about?\nELGIN: Here. This should make everything clear again.\nELGIN: (FX: ELGIN TAKES AN OBJECT FROM HIS POCKET. IT POWERS UP, A\nSUBTLE: TONE. )\nSARRA: (ALARMED) What is that?\nELGIN: It won’t hurt you. If I just place it against your forehead...\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 133\nERYS: What are you doing?\nELGIN: Restoring my daughter’s life to her. Don’t worry, I know what I’m doing. I’m an encephalic surgeon.\nELGIN: Your memories will return to you now. Give it a few minutes and you should remember everything.\nDOCTOR: (CAUTIONARY) Whatever you remember, Erys will become aware of ate\nELGIN: Erys already knows. It read my mind, on the ship.\nERYS: Yes. I know exactly why you came here, Sarra Vanser, and who you are.\nSARRA: Vanser. Yes, that’s right.. I’m Sarra Vanser.\nDOCTOR: Do you remember what you came here for?\nSARRA: I.. (REMEMBERING) Oh no. NO! (CRIES)\nFLIP: What’s the photograph?\nDOCTOR: Her children.\nSARRA: (CRYING) My lovely girls... Jen, Mya... They’re.. they’re here. On Erys.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 134\nDOCTOR: Elgin. What happened?\nELGIN: It may be illegal to visit this system, but a living planet is quite a tourist attraction. There are illicit ‘tours’ run by unscrupulous entrepreneurs. Sarra’s husband Levek arranged to bring the girls on one of these tours, months ago.\nSARRA: (MEMORIES FLOODING BACK) It was a birthday treat for Jen. Yes.\nELGIN: The tour ship never returned. There was a distress call saying they were crashing on Erys, then nothing.\nSARRA: I.. yes, I remember it all. I went to the authorities to demand they send a rescue mission.\nELGIN: Do you remember coming to see me after?\nSARRA: I... Yes! Yes, I came to your apartment.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 135\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 61. INT.

What did they say?\nSARRA: They refuse to send a rescue party.\nELGIN: What? There are children’s lives at stake here! They’ve seen the footage from the robot drone we sent, haven’t they? They know we found the ship, with no bodies in it? That means Levek and the girls left the ship — they survived!\nSARRA: I showed them. But they’re afraid of that damned world. They say they haven’t got a ship that could survive an attack by the creature. And even if they did, they won’t expose their people to Erys or the Drachees’ mind control.\nELGIN: So. We have to find our own way of doing this.\nSARRA: I’ve been thinking about it on the way here. The living moon has to be killed or incapacitated. That’s the only way to find Levek and the girls and get them away.\nELGIN: How do you kill a planet?\nSARRA: The difficult part is getting close without the creature knowing what I intend to do.\nELGIN: What you intend to do??\nSARRA: I’m going to Erys. I’m going to get them back. It’s possible, if you give me a controlled memory wipe.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 136\nELGIN: Oh now, Sarra...\nSARRA: Father, you’re the best encephalic surgeon on Laminus. You could wipe my memories, and implant subconscious drivers so I would still do what I need to do. Erys and its Drachee will have no idea what I’m planning.\nELGIN: I should be the one to go.\nSARRA: You’re the surgeon. You can hardly perform this procedure on yourself. I’ll go, and you can monitor me from a distance.\nELGIN: It’s far too dangerous.\nSARRA: It’s dangerous for my children, your grandchildren. That’s why we have to try.\nELGIN: I suppose we could use the robot drone to get the lay of the land before you travel. That might help the odds of success.\nSARRA: You’1ll do it?\nELGIN: I’1ll start making preparations right away.\nSARRA: Oh father. Thank you.\nELGIN: First question is, how will you get there?\nSARRA: I’1l take Levek’s yacht. After I arrive, while Erys attacks, I’ll get into a lifepod and make my way to the surface. Then once I’ve dealt with Erys, you can come and join me and together we’ll find them.\nSARRA: (GRAMS: MUSIC BOOKENDS THE FLASHBACK AS WE RETURN TO THE PRESENT. )\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 137\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 62. INT. ERYS — MAIN CHAMBER.\nDOCTOR: But you arrived straight into an attack by Erys that was already under way against my TARDIS. You had no time to get into a lifepod.\nSARRA: That almost ruined everything.\nDOCTOR: Then the phototablet of the children almost broke through your memory block.\nSARRA: I just wanted them near me. Their images. I stitched the phototablet into my trousers, not intending to find it. Just to have my girls with me.\nELGIN: Children — there’s no memory blocker strong enough to block those feelings out.\nSARRA: Erys. Where are my children? Where are my daughters and my husband?\nERYS: In time.\nSARRA: What have you done with them? Have they been ‘integrated’?? I demand you tell me!!\nERYS: You will be silent. Challenge me again and you will be absorbed.\nDOCTOR: Do as it says, Sarra.\nERYS: Now, you will all be contained. Humanoids and Drachee alike.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 138\nTERRILL: This is not fair!\nERYS: You have betrayed me! You plotted to abandon me! You were going\nERYS: to go to the worlds outside who mean me nothing but harm.\nTERRILL: We are curious. We want more than this existence.\nERYS: Your place is here with me. You will be detained until you accept that.\nTERRILL: I say — No.\nERYS: Careful, Terrill. Or you will be absorbed as Fem was.\nTERRILL: I don’t think so.\nTERRILL: (FX: A MENTAL FORCE BUILDS UP, EMANATING FROM TERRILL.\nCONTINUES: BEHIND THE FOLLOWING. )\nERYS: What are you doing?\nTERRILL: (MENTAL PROJECTIUON ) Drachee brothers and sisters, join with me.

It’s coming in through that opening in the wall, and going out through that second opening in the floor.\nTERRILL: So?\nDOCTOR: The parallels aren’t exact, but these channels are like trachea. Feeding air to Erys’s vital organs. And as there are nerve ganglia clustered around that opening I’d say that one feeds its nerve centre.\nTERRILL: What do you intend?\nDOCTOR: Nothing fatal.

Just what I was looking for.\nTERRILL: This is the parent’s brain?\nDOCTOR: The brain itself, the organ, will be at the core. And protected behind layers of flesh and membrane. But this chamber contains the nerve clusters that communicate to and from that brain. You see these tubes here?\nTERRILL: I see them.\nDOCTOR: They contain nerve fibres. Each tube is connected to different parts of the brain, responsible for different biological responses and functions. If I’m not mistaken, this cluster here will connect to the equivalent of the hypothalamus.\nTERRILL: What does that do?\nDOCTOR: Many things, mainly autonomic functions like breathing and heartbeat. But it also controls the formation of secretions, which is basically what the mud creatures are. If I can make the right excisions in these fibres, Erys will lose the ability to create any more of the creatures. And the existing ones should become inert.\nTERRILL: It will not harm the parent?\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 152\nDOCTOR: (CROUCHING DOWN) Not if done properly.

Oh.\nTERRILL: What is it?\nDOCTOR: These are the fibres, but some of them are already damaged.\nTERRILL: Damaged, how?\nDOCTOR: I’d say it’s the effect of a disease, or virus, probably some time ago. Damage like this would be very painful to Erys. That could explain the aggression, the mistrust...\nTERRILL: Can it be repaired?\nDOCTOR: Very possibly. First we have to stop these mud creatures. To do that, I'll have to excise some of these other fibres.\nTERRILL: So many of them.\nDOCTOR: The narrower fibres are the ones we want. Hmmm. Still, there is an element of pot luck here.\nTERRILL: (AFRAID) What’s that?\nDOCTOR: Erys knows we’re here. It knows we’re interfering with its nervous system. This could get difficult.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 153\nTERRILL: Do it! Break the fibres!\nDOCTOR: A moment. I need to be sure.

It was like this thing was carrying me around inside it.\nELGIN: Then all of a sudden we regained some measure of self-awareness and control.\nDOCTOR: That will be when the fibres were first severed. Erys’s control of the mud creatures ceased. You had room to think for yourselves. And your latest actions severed the link with Erys completely. Welcome back.\nFLIP: It’s good to be back!\nDOCTOR: And Elgin. Good work on Erys’s nerve fibres.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 161\nELGIN: I’ve rendered the creature unconscious. It’1ll do for now.\nDOCTOR: Could you effect a permanent recovery? Repair the damage that Erys has suffered?\nELGIN: I could. But I don’t know if I will. This thing is evil.\nDOCTOR: Very few beings are truly evil. Erys is a creature that’s been in pain. And you’re a surgeon who can end that pain.\nELGIN: Maybe, but still ...\nDOCTOR: There’s one other thing I would ask you to do as part of the operation. Do you have the memory restorative you used on Sarra?\nELGIN: You mean this?\nELGIN: (FX: ELGIN TAKES FROM HIS POCKET THE OBJECT HE USED TO RESTORE SARRA’S MEMORY IN SCENE 60. HE SWITCHES IT ON. IT POWERS UP.)\nDOCTOR: Yes. I want you to use that to implant a message in Erys during the operation.\nELGIN: I don’t see why not. But what message?\nDOCTOR: Let’s call it a lesson in parenting.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 162\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 73. INT. INTEGRATION CHAMBER [LATER].\nDOCTOR WHO: (FX: FADE UP. A NUMBER OF CONTROL WHEELS ARE BEING TURNED. THERE IS A RUSH OF DRAINING FLUID WITHIN THE CONTAINERS. )\nSARRA: It worked. The containers are draining. Will my family be all right?\nDOCTOR: They should be fine. They’ve been expertly preserved. They won’t have known anything of what’s happened to them since they were integrated. And now we’ve reversed the process properly, there’s no danger to them.\nDOCTOR: JEN, MYA and LEVEK:\nFLIP: They’re awake!\nDOCTOR: Sarra. That switch will open their containers.\nDOCTOR: (FX: SARRA OPERATES THE CONTROL. THREE CONTAINERS CLICK AND\nSWING: OPEN. )\nJEN AND MYA: Mother! Mother!\nSARRA: My beautiful girls! Oh come here. Let me hold you!\nJEN: Where is this place?\nMYA: Is this a hospital? We were in a crash, it was horrible.\nSARRA: I’1l tell you everything later.\nLEVEK: (APPROACHING) Sarra? Oh Sarra.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 163\nSARRA: Levek! Oh darling, I’m so glad you’re safe!\nLEVEK: Sarra, I’m sorry. I had no idea it was so dangerous. Our girls...\nSARRA: Shhh. I’m just glad we’re all back together again.\nDOCTOR: And now you can go home.\nSARRA: Will it be safe to go?\nDOCTOR: Oh yes. Erys and I have had a meeting of minds on a number of subjects. Which reminds me, Erys is expecting me for a chat. Come on, Flip.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 164\nDOCTOR WHO: SCENE 74. INT. ERYS — MAIN CHAMBER.\nDOCTOR: (ENTERING) Erys. How are you?\nERYS: I am well, Doctor. I feel .. renewed. Calmer. At peace.\nDOCTOR: You’re lucky to have had someone as skilled as Elgin on hand to repair your neural damage.\nERYS: I know what he did. What you both did. During the repair I was implanted with memories. His daughter’s memories as a mother.\nDOCTOR: Erys, I ...\nERYS: And also your own memories.\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nERYS: A generous gift, the memories of a Time Lord.\nDOCTOR: Gladly given, for a purpose.\nERYS: A lonely childhood. A rebellious adolescence... You couldn’t wait to get away from your people and your planet, Gallifrey, could you?.. So many adventures you have had in your travels. So many enemies, but so many friends. Sarah Jane and Romana. Jo, and Leela, and Nyssa, and...\nFLIP: (CLEARS THROAT) A-hem-?\nERYS: . Peri. (THOUGHTFUL) Yes, the thought of Peri is strong in you. There are more. Many more. But above all —\nFLIP: (EXPECTANT) Aww —\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 165\nERYS: Above all... Susan.\nFLIP: (PUT OUT) Who?!\nDOCTOR: Susan. My granddaughter.\nFLIP: You’re a grandad?!\nERYS: You loved her and protected her.\nDOCTOR: I did. Of course.\nERYS: And then you let her go.\nDOCTOR: I left her on Earth. With the man she had fallen in love with.\nERYS: You didn’t just let her go, you shut her out. You made her follow a life without you.\nDOCTOR: She thought she needed to look after me. I knew she needed to follow her own path, and embrace her own happiness.\nERYS: You said: “Go forward in all your beliefs.. And prove to me that I am not mistaken in mine.”\nDOCTOR: I believe I did. (PAUSE) Erys?\nERYS: (HESITANT) Did you expect me to be swayed by such an obvious trick?\nDOCTOR: No trick, Erys. It’s no more than my true memory. That’s what you do when you love your children, you let them go.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 166\nERYS: Don’t worry, Doctor. Whether a trick or not, I will keep to the bargain we struck. I feel ready to take this chance. If you and Elgin and his daughter have melded my thoughts, so be it.\nDOCTOR: It’s a big step, Erys. I understand you’re nervous. But be brave, be bold.\nERYS: But what if the Drachee leave and never return? And if I allow the neighbouring systems to visit here, what if they come as aggressors?\nDOCTOR: The Drachee, they’1l return, or most of them will. And some will choose to stay here and never leave. It’s called self- determination.\nFLIP: And if you let visitors come here, without smashing their ships and that, I’m sure before you know it you’1l have neighbours on Asphya for the Drachee to get to know.\nDOCTOR: And as for the neighbouring systems, well, the representatives who are on their way to see you will discuss your concerns. They’ve already agreed to provide security patrols to keep out those with less than friendly intentions towards you.\nERYS: Your memories showed me for the first time the breadth of life and experience that exists across the universe. There is great goodness.\nDOCTOR: Indeed.\nERYS: And great evil.\nDOCTOR: The evil is an exception. Evil just shouts louder than goodness.\nERYS: Yes. I saw that in your mind too. (PAUSE) I make no promises, but I will speak with these representatives. And I will allow my Drachee to travel if they so wish.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 167\nDOCTOR: I’m hopeful you will find agreement with your neighbours, Erys. It’s natural to doubt, and even be afraid, when faced with great change.\nERYS: As with you and your granddaughter.\nDOCTOR: Sorry?\nERYS: When you shut her out of your TARDIS and gave her a separate life. You were full of doubt, and afraid.\nDOCTOR: . Yes.\nERYS: Your heart was heavy. But you did it because you believed it was the best thing for her. And you have regretted that decision many times since. You miss her.\nDOCTOR: I do. And although I have sometimes, selfishly, wished it undone, there’s no doubt in my mind that it was the best thing for Susan.\nERYS: Thank you for those memories, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Thank you. And goodbye, Erys. Good luck. Come on, Flip.\nFLIP: That it? Problem solved?\nDOCTOR: It would appear so. Yes, all in all, a most satisfactory outcome.\nFLIP: So where to now? You still owe me a return trip to Tranquillity.\nDOCTOR WHO: THE BROOD OF ERYS by Andrew Smith (NB FINAL) Page 168\nDOCTOR: I’m not sure about that. (STOPPING) Flip, [I —]\nFLIP: (STOPPING) What do you mean, not sure about — Oh, I get it. It’s this Peri, isn’t it? We’re gonna recalibrate the TARDIS’s wireless, then we’re going off in search of this Peri? Something like that?\nDOCTOR: (DEEP BREATH) .. Something like that, yes.\nFLIP: Phew. For a minute there, I thought you were about to say you were gonna shut me out of the TARDIS. Like that’s ever gonna happen, right?\nDOCTOR: As you would say, Miss Jackson... “As if.”\nDOCTOR: CRASH IN CLOSING THEME."
