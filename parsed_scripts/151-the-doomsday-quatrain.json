The Albizzis blame the Venetians — no change there — but I hear the Venetians are too busy wading through the mud between their islands now to notice.\nDOCTOR: (TO SELF) Venice without its canals, but the TARDIS brings me to Florence. Typical. (TO BERNARDO) When did all this start?\nDOCTOR: THE DOOMSDAY QUATRAIN by Emma Beeby & Gordon Rennie (FINAL) Page 13\nBERNARDO: Only yesterday. If you are going to Venice, I have the very latest in Venetian fashion here. —\nDOCTOR: That won’t be necessary. I don’t think feathers are really me.\nMADMAN: (OFF) I warn you, the doomsday is coming! Just as Nostradamu foretold!\nDOCTOR: (TO SELF) Nostradamus, eh?\nBERNARDO: You know him, sir?\nDOCTOR: Not really, but his wife once knitted me a rather fetching scarf. Or will. So what’s he predicted this time?\nBERNARDO: Some nonsense about flying ships in the sky, talking crocodiles, the world ending and so on. You know how seers a If you ask me, the city guard should lock them all up.\nGARILUND: (FX: APPROACHING FROM OFF, PUSHING THROUGH CROWD) Excuse me... SOrTy...\nDOCTOR: Yes, that’s usually what happens with anyone saying things people don’t want to hear. Good day to you, [Bernardo —]\nGARILUND: (JOSTLES INTO DOCTOR) Oh! I beg your pardon, sir.\nDOCTOR: Not at all. My fault entirely.\nGARILUND: No matter. I must be going. — (MOVES OFF)\nDOCTOR: Now there’s a lady in a hurry.\nBERNARDO: The Lady Garilund, sir. A visitor, like yourself. Bit of an one, she is.\nBERNARDO: Ss\nBERNARDO: re.\nBERNARDO: odd\nBERNARDO: THE DOOMSDAY QUATRAIN by Emma Beeby & Gordon Rennie (FINAL) Page 14\nDOCTOR: More than you think.\nBERNARDO: Been pestering Nostradamus, they say. Probably wants her fortune told, or to learn the name of her future husband. You know how young women are.\nDOCTOR: Nostradamus again. Excuse me, Bernardo. (MOVES AWAY)\nBERNARDO: (CALLING AFTER HIM) Wait! Are you sure I can’t sell you a hat?\nDOCTOR: (CALLING BACK) Sorry, must dash. Have to see a man about the end of the world!\nDOCTOR: THE DOOMSDAY QUATRAIN by Emma Beeby & Gordon Rennie (FINAL) Page 15\nDOCTOR: SCENE 8: EXT. FLORENCE BACKSTREET\nBRORS: (LOUD HISS) Garilund! Here! Over here!\nGARILUND: (APPROACHING) Chief Administrator Brors? I wasn’t sure I’d recognise you —\nBRORS: (INTERRUPTING) With my Hologuise on? Don’t be foolish, Second Researcher. You should know the pitch frequency only affects the brains of lesser life-forms. We Poldagons are hardly that.\nGARILUND: Sir, I know you’re going to tell me to return. I know I’ve been here over schedule, but [the thing is..]\nBRORS: Your time is up, Second Researcher. The operation starts in less than half a day cycle.\nGARILUND: [..] The thing is...\nBRORS: We've discussed this. I can’t understand why you continue to pursue this foolish notion.\nGARILUND: With, respect, if you read my paper—\nBRORS: I have read your paper. Your propositions were well presented, but ultimately flawed.\nGARILUND: But I’ve found new data to support my theory. Please, sir, I just need more time.\nBRORS: What kind of data?\nGARILUND: An individual among the general population. One who exhibits abilities not previously seen in this species.\nBRORS: Not ‘species’, Second Researcher. Bio-units.\nBRORS: THE DOOMSDAY QUATRAIN by Emma Beeby & Gordon Rennie (FINAL) Page 16\nGARILUND: Yes, sir. ‘Among this particular class of bio-units.’ I’ve already forwarded my provisional findings to the Poldagon Science Academy, [and —]\nBRORS: The Science Academy? Why?\nGARILUND: I’ve got a friend there. He thought my theory bore investigation and asked me to send him any new data I found. If he’s convinced, the Academy may inspect the facility themselves.\nBRORS: I see. (BEAT) How much more time do you need?\nGARILUND: One more day-cycle, and I’m sure I can gather evidence to convince you to suspend all operations for the time being.\nBRORS: Very well. Complete your fieldwork. I’1l delay the start of the operation to give you the time you need.\nGARILUND: (SURPRISED) Thank you, Chief Administrator. Thank you!\nBRORS: Just assure me of something. This bio-unit you’ve found, you’re sure it exhibits enough of the criteria to satisfy the Academy’s definitions?\nGARILUND: I am, sir. You won’t be disappointed, once you inspect it for yourself. He- it lives not far from here. Maybe I could show you?\nBRORS: No time, I’m afraid. I’ve a lot of work to do, especially since I’1l now have to re-negotiate with the client to get you the time you need.\nGARILUND: Yes, sir. I can’t tell you how much this means to me.\nBRORS: I want you to understand that this has not been an easy decision for me, Garilund. I want you to remember that.\nGARILUND: Yes, sir. I will.\nGARILUND: THE DOOMSDAY QUATRAIN by Emma Beeby & Gordon Rennie (FINAL) Page 17\nBRORS: Go and gather your evidence. I look forward to reviewing it in person when we meet again back at the facility.\nGARILUND: Yes, sir. And thank you again! (LEAVES)\nBRORS: (TO HIMSELF) Not an easy decision. I really am sorry, Garilund. Very sorry indeed. (FX: RADIO LINK OPENING UP) Kren? I want you to put me through to the clients.\nKREN: (ON RADIO) A new problem?\nBRORS: Not at all. I’ve good news for them — we’re going to be able to advance the start of the operation, at no extra charge.\nKREN: (ON RADIO) But Second Researcher Garilund —\nBRORS: . is aware of the situation — I saw to that personally — and will return to us with plenty of time to spare. I’m porting back to the facility. I expect everything to be ready on my arrival. Brors out.\nBRORS: THE DOOMSDAY QUATRAIN by Emma Beeby & Gordon Rennie (FINAL) Page 18\nBRORS: SCENE 9: INT. NOSTRADAMUS’ HOUSE\nMILO: Not again-! (BUSTLING UP) (ALOUD) I’ve told you once, my Lady. (FX: OPENING DOOR) I don’t want to have to summon the City Guard, but —\nDOCTOR: Hello. I think you may have been expecting someone else...?\nMILO: My sincerest apologies, sir. How may I assist?\nDOCTOR: I’m told that this is the residence of Michel de Nostredame.\nMILO: Have you come for a reading?\nDOCTOR: In a manner of speaking.\nMILO: You're not a foreign traveller, by any chance?\nDOCTOR: I suppose I am. Why, is that a problem?\nMILO: Not at all, sir. Please, come in.\nDOCTOR: (FX: ENTERS. DOOR CLOSED BEHIND) Might I ask, who were you expecting just now?\nMILO: Master Nostradamus has been receiving some unwanted attention of late. Obsessive types. Won’t give him a moment’s peace. If you'd just wait here, I shall see if he’s free, mister...?\nDOCTOR: Doctor.\nMILO: A man of learning. The master will enjoy that. So difficult for him to find someone on his own level to talk to. (FX: EXITS UPSTAIRS)\nDOCTOR: Yes, I know the feeling.\nDOCTOR: THE DOOMSDAY QUATRAIN by Emma Beeby & Gordon Rennie (FINAL) Page 19\nDOCTOR: SCENE 10: INT. POLDAGON LABORATORY\nKREN: (INTO RADIO) Garilund? It’s Kren. Are you receiving me? (FX:\nRADIO: STATIC) Do you copy? Garilund!\nKREN: (TO SELF) Where are you...?\nLARRETT: (APPROACHING FROM OFF) Not still mooning over Garilund, Facilitator Kren?\nKREN: (STARTLED) Oh! Larrett. It’s you.\nLARRETT: You are aware the countdown to the start of the operation has begun?\nKREN: Forgive me, Larrett, but you’re still just a Third Rank researcher, aren’t you?\nLARRETT: For the moment.\nKREN: Right. So I don’t actually have to pay much attention to anything you say.\nLARRETT: No need for hostility. I’m merely trying to ensure that the proper protocols are being observed.\nKREN: Which includes ensuring all facility personnel are safely out of the test zone before the operation begins. Which is why I’m trying to ascertain the whereabouts of our Second Researcher.\nLARRETT: You and Garilund. Why not just ask her out to dinner? Once she shoots you down in flames, we’1ll all be spared your agony.\nKREN: Thank you, Larrett. Please don’t let me keep you from whatever vital duties they allocate to Third Rank researchers.\nKREN: THE DOOMSDAY QUATRAIN by Emma Beeby & Gordon Rennie (FINAL) Page 20\nBRORS: (FROM DOORWAY) Quite right, Kren.\nLARRETT: Chief Administrator Brors!\nBRORS: Hurry along, Third Researcher.\nLARRETT: Yes, sir.\nBRORS: And, er — report to my office, will you, when you have a free moment?\nLARRETT: Of course, sir. (LEAVES)\nKREN: Administrator, I’m experiencing communications problems. I can’t raise Second Researcher Garilund.\nBRORS: Yes, I did try telling the clients that there was little point jamming the communications systems of a planet that hasn’t yet developed any, but they do seem to be sticklers for tradition.\nKREN: Sir...?\nBRORS: (IGNORING HIM) Now, back to your post. The last thing we need now are any hold-ups in the countdown.\nKREN: (MORE FORCEFULLY) Sir. You did warn Second Researcher Garilund that zero-hour had been brought forward?\nBRORS: Of course. I hope you’re not implying I’d be so negligent as to expose my staff to danger?\nKREN: Of course not, sir. —\nBRORS: Good.\nKREN: . it’s just, I just don’t understand why she hasn’t returned.\nKREN: THE DOOMSDAY QUATRAIN by Emma Beeby & Gordon Rennie (FINAL) Page 21\nBRORS: Perhaps she has. Perhaps she came back through a different part of the ComPort net, and hasn’t reported for duty yet.\nKREN: Perhaps.\nBRORS: Yes, I’m sure that’s what must have happened. This is a rather large facility, and the client’s jamming operation may have affected our own internal communications.\nKREN: That’s possible, I suppose.\nBRORS: Of course it is. We’ll do a facility-wide scan for her... just as soon as the countdown is concluded. Agreed?\nKREN: (RELUCTANTLY) Yes, sir.\nBRORS: Now, onwards. The sooner we get this operation started, the sooner we can bid goodbye to our current clients. (EXITING) Carry on, Kren...\nBRORS: THE DOOMSDAY QUATRAIN by Emma Beeby & Gordon Rennie (FINAL) Page 22\nBRORS: SCENE 11: INT. NOSTRADAMUS’ STUDY\nMILO: The Doctor, master.\nNOSTRADAMUS: Very good, Milo. Leave us now.\nDOCTOR: Good morning, Master Nostradamus. (FX: CHAIR SCRAPED BACK) May Tie?\nNOSTRADAMUS: Of course, be seated. (BEAT) And what has brought you here today, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: As I explained to your manservant, I’m a traveller —\nNOSTRADAMUS: So very far from home, yes. (BEAT) And so... alone.\nDOCTOR: Most astute. I imagine you say that to all the tourists.\nNOSTRADAMUS: A little obvious, I grant you. But I doubt you are here to talk about your past. The question is — what do you want to know of your future?\nDOCTOR: As little as possible, as a general rule.\nNOSTRADAMUS: (LAUGHS) There is nothing to fear from seeking answers, Doctor. The future is... open-ended.\nDOCTOR: Sometimes.\nNOSTRADAMUS: I have seen through time and space, Doctor. From this very room. I’ve seen terrible things, wonderful things!\nDOCTOR: And all from your armchair. Impressive.\nDOCTOR: THE DOOMSDAY QUATRAIN by Emma Beeby & Gordon Rennie (FINAL) Page 23\nNOSTRADAMUS: Perhaps we can start with a birth chart? The placing of the stars at birth is a telling guide to a man’s fate. Where were you born?\nDOCTOR: I don’t think you’d know it.\nNOSTRADAMUS: Try me, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Gallifrey.\nNOSTRADAMUS: Charming place. South of France, yes?\nDOCTOR: Not exactly.\nNOSTRADAMUS: Well, not exactly south. On the way, though, yes?\nDOCTOR: Perhaps astrology isn’t appropriate, in my case.\nNOSTRADAMUS: Doctor, if you don’t want to know your future, and you don’t want an astrological reading, what do you want to know?\nDOCTOR: Just one thing. I’d like to know how the world will end.\nDOCTOR: THE DOOMSDAY QUATRAIN by Emma Beeby & Gordon Rennie (FINAL) Page 24\nDOCTOR: SCENE 12: EXT. NOSTRADAMUS’ HOUSE\nGARILUND: (SOTTO, INTO RADIO) Kren? It’s Garilund again. Can you hear me? I’m going to assume you can, and it’s just me who’s not receiving. (BEAT) I’ve decided — there’s too much at stake. I’ve got to get my research subject out of here, before the clients arrive. I know Brors will fire me — breach of research protocol and unauthorised intervention in an ongoing operation — but I really don’t care. Wish me luck... (RUMMAGES IN HER CLOTHING) Oh, and —\nGARILUND: I listened to what you said, about not going into the test zone unprotected. Type three energy pistol. Single power setting, stun only. Okay, here I —\nGARILUND: (FX: HEAVY FOOTSTEPS COMING UP STREET, CLANK OF WEAPONS AND ARMOUR)\nCAPTAIN OF THE GUARD: (LOUDLY) Make way! In the name of his Lordship the Duke of Medici, make way for the City Guard!\nGARILUND: (INTO RADIO) I’m too late! They’re coming for Nostradamus!\nGARILUND: THE DOOMSDAY QUATRAIN by Emma Beeby & Gordon Rennie (FINAL) Page 25\nGARILUND: SCENE 13: INT. NOSTRADAMUS’ STUDY\nNOSTRADAMUS: The end of the world? I’m sure it’s a long way off, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: There’s a man in the market square who say otherwise. And I doubt he’s alone.\nNOSTRADAMUS: People are so easily excited.\nDOCTOR: Then you didn’t predict that the river would disappear overnight?\nNOSTRADAMUS: They read into my predictions all kinds of things. Why are you so interested, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Because I’ve seen the end of the world, and I happen to know that’s not due to happen for a few millennia yet.\nNOSTRADAMUS: You are a seer?\nDOCTOR: I saw it because I was there.\nNOSTRADAMUS: Doctor, I must request that you leave now. I am getting... tired.\nDOCTOR: I think you know what is going on. Why won’t you tell me?\nNOSTRADAMUS: (RAISES VOICE) Because there’s nothing to be done about it.\nDOCTOR: And I thought the future was open-ended.\nNOSTRADAMUS: Not for me.\nMILO: (DOWNSTAIRS) No, Master Nostradamus is not to be [disturbed! ]\nMILO: THE DOOMSDAY QUATRAIN by Emma Beeby & Gordon Rennie (FINAL) Page 26\nCAPTAIN OF THE GUARD: (MARCHING IN DOWNSTAIRS) Out of the way. We’re here on the Duke’s business!\nNOSTRADAMUS: What is the meaning of this commotion?\nCAPTAIN OF THE GUARD: (ENTERING ROOM) Michel de Nostredame? Also known as the prophet and seer Nostradamus?\nNOSTRADAMUS: I am.\nCAPTAIN OF THE GUARD: You’re under arrest, on charges of panic-mongering and the spreading of false prophecies. You men — take him away.\nNOSTRADAMUS: (FX: GRABBED BY GUARDS) This is an outrage!\nCAPTAIN OF THE GUARD: Yeah, yeah.\nDOCTOR: One moment, Captain. The Duke’s business, you said. That would be his Lordship the Duke of Medici, correct?\nCAPTAIN OF THE GUARD: (TO DOCTOR) What’s it to you? You an acolyte of Nostradamus...?\nDOCTOR: No, no. He was telling me about the future.\nCAPTAIN OF THE GUARD: Then we’ve saved you your money. The only future Master Nostradamus has is an appointment with the executioner. (TO GUARDS) Right, men — follow me.\nCAPTAIN OF THE GUARD: THE DOOMSDAY QUATRAIN by Emma Beeby & Gordon Rennie (FINAL) Page 27\nCAPTAIN OF THE GUARD: SCENE 14: EXT.

[ETC]\nNOSTRADAMUS: (WEAKLY STRUGGLING) Stop! This is all a terrible mistake!\nCAPTAIN OF THE GUARD: Some prophet. If he’d seen this coming, he’d have been out the window long before we got here.\nCAPTAIN OF THE GUARD: (LOUDLY, TO CROWD) Clear the way!\nGARILUND: (COMING OUT OF HIDING, WHISPERING INTO RADIO) Kren, they’ve taken my research subject! (HURRYING) I’m following them. I won't be able to use my ComPort — too many witnesses. Tell\nGARILUND: Brors! Tell him we must save the subject!\nGARILUND: THE DOOMSDAY QUATRAIN by Emma Beeby & Gordon Rennie (FINAL) Page 28\nGARILUND: SCENE 15: INT. BRORS’ OFFICE\nBRORS: (SLIGHTLY OFF) Come in!\nLARRETT: (FX: FOLLOW AS HE ENTERS OFFICE) Chief Administrator. You asked me to report to you, when I had a free moment?\nBRORS: Yes, yes, so I did.. Second Researcher Larrett.\nLARRETT: Sir, I’m still just a Third Rank Researcher.\nBRORS: Not any more, Second Researcher. Congratulations.\nLARRETT: Thank you, sir. But.. what about Second Researcher Garilund?\nBRORS: Always sad to lose a long-term team member... but, er, her mind seems to have been elsewhere recently. I wasn’t surprised when she told me she wished to step down from her post.\nLARRETT: She’s resigned?\nBRORS: With immediate effect. In fact, I doubt we’ll even see her back here after her current field trip is over.\nLARRETT: Thank you this opportunity, sir. You won’t regret it.\nBRORS: I’m sure. Oh, and Second Researcher?\nLARRETT: Sir?\nBRORS: Let’s keep this between ourselves, for the moment. Garilund was popular with some of the more impressionable members of the team. I wouldn’t want any upsets, not at this time.\nLARRETT: Of course, sir. I understand.\nLARRETT: THE DOOMSDAY QUATRAIN by Emma Beeby & Gordon Rennie (FINAL) Page 29\nLARRETT: SCENE 16: EXT.

You cannot treat me like this!\nCAPTAIN OF THE GUARD: Save it for the Duke, soothsayer!\nDOCTOR: (HURRYING UP ALONGSIDE) Captain, if I might intercede...?\nCAPTAIN OF THE GUARD: (STOPPING) You again?!?\nDOCTOR: (STOPPED) Indeed. It concerns your employer, the Duke of Medici. As it happens, I once assisted his great great- grandfather in some bother with the Borgias. As an old friend of the family, if you could get me an audience with the Duke, [then —]\nCAPTAIN OF THE GUARD: Not my province, sir. I’m just carrying out my orders. (ALOUD) Carry on, you men!\nDOCTOR: (ASIDE) Remarkable. No matter which century you’re in or what Side of the universe you’re on, you’ll always run into someone who’s “just carrying out orders”.\nNOSTRADAMUS: (WEAKLY) I see it now! Doctor... I see it! I..

Studious types, tend to keep themselves to themselves.\nNOSTRADAMUS: You’ve seen such creatures before?\nDOCTOR: Secretive, too.

Nothing fancy.\nGARILUND: (SOTTO) Who are you, Doctor? Where are you from?\nNOSTRADAMUS: (SOTTO) Someplace in France. ‘Gallifrey’, wasn’t it?\nGARILUND: (SQUEAKS EXCITEDLY) Gallifrey?!?

After all, you’ve been promoted to Second Researcher.\nLARRETT: I’m not sure...\nKREN: Activate the system for me, Larrett.\nLARRETT: Maybe I should talk to Administrator Brors —\nKREN: Brors has revoked my status.

From there we can get back to the surface.\nKREN: (RUNNING TO STOP) There’s no way we’ll make it without being caught. Besides, they’ll have deactivated the ComPort system by now.\nGARILUND: We have to try. The man I found, Nostradamus. He’s the key.\nKREN: Garilund, the odds of him surviving alone...\nGARILUND: He’s not alone. I met someone else on the surface. A Time Lord.\nKREN: A Time Lord? Come on.\nGARILUND: I know!

Hopefully, they won’t think to look for us here.\nKREN: Garilund, about all this...\nGARILUND: I know, you don’t believe me. First bio-units with signs of higher sentience, and now I’m seeing Time Lords.\nKREN: There’s higher sentience, then there's...\nGARILUND: The research subject I found displayed evidence of advanced intelligence. He was capable of precognition.\nKREN: But if that was possible, wouldn’t someone have discovered it already?\nGARILUND: Maybe they did. And maybe Brors covered it up, just like he’s trying to do now. Let me ask you something — what’s this facility for?\nKREN: Research. Pushing forward the boundaries of Poldagon science.\nGARILUND: Money, Kren. It’s about money, to fund all that pushing forward of the boundaries of science.

Wait, where are you going?\nGARILUND: Weren’t you listening?

A true honour.\nDOCTOR: Indeed.\nNOSTRADAMUS: Excuse me, but where is the Lady Garilund?\nBRORS: (TO DOCTOR) This being is with you?\nNOSTRADAMUS: ‘Being’?\nDOCTOR: Michel de Nostredame. Quite famous, on his homeworld.\nNOSTRADAMUS: Really?\nBRORS: (LAUGHS) Of course. Now, shall we?\nDOCTOR: Shall we what?\nBRORS: Begin your tour of the facility. So gratifying to know our achievements are known even on Gallifrey.\nDOCTOR: I’m sure. And my friend here?\nDOCTOR: THE DOOMSDAY QUATRAIN by Emma Beeby & Gordon Rennie (FINAL) Page 62\nBRORS: My guards will escort him to a secure area.\nDOCTOR: I’d prefer it if he came along.\nBRORS: I doubt he’d understand anything of it. A lot of complicated\nBRORS: technical information.\nDOCTOR: Of course. It’s alright, Michel. I’1ll see you soon.\nSECURITY GUARD: Follow me.\nBRORS: This way, Doctor. I think you’1ll be impressed by what we've\nBRORS: achieved here.\nBRORS: THE DOOMSDAY QUATRAIN by Emma Beeby & Gordon Rennie (FINAL) Page 63\nBRORS: SCENE 36: INT. PORT BAY 12 — OVERHEAD AREA [CONTINUOUS]\nGARILUND: (SOTTO) Looks like we’re too late.\nKREN: (SOTTO) That’s your Time Lord? Doesn’t look very impressive.\nGARILUND: (SOTTO) Brors is giving him the VIP treatment. He must think he’s a prospective client.\nKREN: (SOTTO) And the other one, your ‘higher sentience’ bio-unit? Where do you think they’re taking him?\nGARILUND: (SOTTO) Imagine you’re Brors. Imagine you’ve found a bio-unit loose outside the test zone. Where would you send it?\nKREN: (SOTTO) Oh.\nGARILUND: (SOTTO) Exactly. You go after Nostradamus, I’1l try to get the Doctor away from Brors.\nKREN: (SOTTO, LEAVING) Okay. Oh, and Garilund...\nGARILUND: (SOTTO) I know. ‘Don’t shoot anyone.’ I’1l try.\nGARILUND: THE DOOMSDAY QUATRAIN by Emma Beeby & Gordon Rennie (FINAL) Page 64\nGARILUND: SCENE 37: INT. POLDAGON CONTROL ROOM\nCOMPUTER VOICE: Incoming communication: spokes-being for the Command Conclave of the Phalanx of Kro. They wish to speak to Administrator Brors.\nLARRETT: The Administrator is busy. And he’s ordered me to take care of some malfunctioning bio-unit. What do they want?\nCOMPUTER VOICE: Kro spokes-being’s voice patterns exhibiting signs of extreme agitation.\nLARRETT: Put them through. I’m quite capable of negotiation. (FX: RADIO HISS) This is Third— I mean, Second Researcher Larrett.\nSECOND NUNCIO: (D) This one Nuncio of the First Spear, chosen voice of the Phalanx of Kro. You speak for the Blueskins?\nLARRETT: For the Poldagon science facility, yes.\nSECOND NUNCIO: (D) Blueskins in breach of contract. Stolen property belonging to Kro taken from test zone. We demand return of property and immediate reparations.\nLARRETT: Now, wait just a minute...\nSECOND NUNCIO: (D) Phalanx negotiators coming aboard facility to begin reparations. Do not resist.\nLARRETT: (RATTLED) Hello? Hello?\nLARRETT: THE DOOMSDAY QUATRAIN by Emma Beeby & Gordon Rennie (FINAL) Page 65\nLARRETT: SCENE 38: INT. SHOWROOM\nLARRETT: (FX: ELEVATOR COMES TO HALT. TECHY PING. DOORS SLIDE OPEN INTO\nVAST: SPACE)\nBRORS: (STEPPING OUT) Here we are, Doctor. See for yourself. I call this ‘the showroom’.\nDOCTOR: (FOLLOWING) Your ‘showroom’ has an ocean inside it?\nBRORS: You think that’s impressive? Just wait. (INTO AIR) Control, run Simulation 5081.\nCOMPUTER VOICE: Simulation commencing.\nDOCTOR: It’s moving.\nBRORS: No, building. This is a sea of bio-matter. We control it, every molecule. It can be anything, as long as we’ve collected enough research data.\nBRORS: (FX: RUMBLING BUILDS THEN SUDDENLY STOPS. STRANGE NOISES OF BIRDSONG, CREATURES )\nDOCTOR: I know this place. It’s...\nBRORS: The lost jungles of Rolagtha.\nDOCTOR: Burned, not lost. The whole planet was destroyed by solar flares.\nBRORS: And yet we have recreated its jungles here, right down to the molecular level.\nDOCTOR: So, you have he ability to recreate any environment, any lifeform. Impressive. And terrifying.\nBRORS: I don’t understand.\nBRORS: THE DOOMSDAY QUATRAIN by Emma Beeby & Gordon Rennie (FINAL) Page 66\nDOCTOR: No, but now I’m starting to. This facility. I’ve not left the planet at all, have I? I’m inside it.\nBRORS: Of course. An artificial world, built to the average size of most life supporting planets.\nDOCTOR: And its surface? Composed of bio-matter?\nBRORS: In its raw liquid state, yes. Ready to be formed into whatever our clients desire.\nDOCTOR: (TO HIMSELF) An ocean of grey...\nBRORS: We can recreate any world we have on file. Any moment in its history, captured in perfect clarity.\nDOCTOR: Including 16th century Earth?\nBRORS: Our current clients wished to conduct an invasion training scenario on a low-tech planet. It seemed a good match.\nDOCTOR: An imitation Earth, populated by imitation humans. And when your clients are finished playing with it, you just dissolve everything and reform it into something else.\nBRORS: Yes. Impressive, don’t you agree?\nDOCTOR: More like appalling.\nBRORS: I beg your pardon?\nDOCTOR: The Phalanx of Kro are monsters because the universe created them that way. What’s your excuse?\nBRORS: I’m not sure I...\nBRORS: THE DOOMSDAY QUATRAIN by Emma Beeby & Gordon Rennie (FINAL) Page 67\nDOCTOR: Serial genocide, that’s what’s going on here. Creating living\nDOCTOR: world after living world, then erasing them.\nBRORS: I thought you wanted to hire the facility —\nDOCTOR: Quite the contrary. I’m shutting you down.\nBRORS: (CALLING OUT) Control, alert Security.\nDOCTOR: Call your security. I’m not leaving until I’ve safeguarded every single life on the artificial surface of your horror planet. And neither you nor your clients are going to stop\nDOCTOR: END OF PART TWO\nDOCTOR: me.\nDOCTOR: THE DOOMSDAY QUATRAIN by Emma Beeby & Gordon Rennie (FINAL) Page 68"

Creating living\nDOCTOR: world after living world, then erasing them.\nBRORS: I thought you wanted to hire the facility —\nDOCTOR: Quite the contrary. I’m shutting you down.\nBRORS: (CALLING OUT) Control, alert Security.\nDOCTOR: Call your security. I’m not leaving until I’ve safeguarded every single life on the artificial surface of your horror planet. And neither you nor your clients are going to stop me.\nDOCTOR: SCENE 39: INT. SHOWROOM [CONTINUOUS]\nBRORS: Ah, that will be the security team.\nDOCTOR: Already?\nBRORS: Security, remove this — [individual] (TRAILS OFF)\nGARILUND: (STEPPING OUT, ADVANCING) Hello, Brors.\nDOCTOR: Ah, the Lady Garilund. How nice. I, er, take it you two know\nDOCTOR: each other?\nGARILUND: (FX: GUN CHARGING) He was my boss, until he tried to kill me.\nGARILUND: THE DOOMSDAY QUATRAIN by Emma Beeby & Gordon Rennie (FINAL) Page 69\nBRORS: Put the gun down, Garilund. I promise you, I have no idea what you’re talking about...\nGARILUND: Why was it you left me for dead up there, Brors? Because you suspected my theories were right? Because I threatened to report everything to the Science Academy? (ADVANCING, MENACING) The bio-units are living beings. How many of them have I helped you kill? Hundreds of millions? Billions?\nDOCTOR: Whatever your grievance, Garilund, it won’t be made better by a weapon.\nBRORS: (NERVOUS NOW) H-he’s right. We’re Poldagons, not bloodthirsty\nBRORS: creatures like the Kro. —\nCOMPUTER VOICE: (TANNOY) Security team arriving at Showroom.\nBRORS: About time!\nGARILUND: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Not to worry. I know what to do in these situations.\nGARILUND: Which is?\nDOCTOR: Run!\nBRORS: (TO SECURITY TEAM) Well, don’t just stand there! After them!\nBRORS: (BEAT) Morons. (INTO AIR) Control, what’s the status of the bio-unit the Doctor brought with him?\nBRORS: THE DOOMSDAY QUATRAIN by Emma Beeby & Gordon Rennie (FINAL) Page 70\nCOMPUTER VOICE: (TANNOY) Bio-unit is being taken by Second Researcher Larrett for recycling.\nBRORS: Let me know as soon as it’s been disposed of.\nBRORS: THE DOOMSDAY QUATRAIN by Emma Beeby & Gordon Rennie (FINAL) Page 71\nBRORS: SCENE 40: INT. CORRIDOR/LAB\nNOSTRADAMUS: (WALKING) What’s happening? Where’s the Lady Garilund?\nLARRETT: (WALKING) Cease talking. It is against regulations for Facility personnel to communicate with the bio-units.\nNOSTRADAMUS: (WALKING) What’s your name? Can you tell me that, at least?\nLARRETT: (STOPPING, SIGHING) It is against regulations [for —]\nNOSTRADAMUS: (INTERRUPTING) Mine’s Michel. Michel de Nostredame. You’re going to kill me, aren’t you? I don’t need to be a seer to know that.\nLARRETT: In here.\nNOSTRADAMUS: Is this where it happens? Where you kill me? Strange, I never foresaw any of this...\nLARRETT: Recycling.\nNOSTRADAMUS: What?\nLARRETT: It’s called recycling. Killing is unethical. We have strict guidelines about this kind of thing. Anyway, you’re not really alive in the first place.\nNOSTRADAMUS: Then... what am I?\nLARRETT: You’re a small mass of bio-matter programmed to act as if it’s a living being from one of the planets we have on record.\nLARRETT: THE DOOMSDAY QUATRAIN by Emma Beeby & Gordon Rennie (FINAL) Page 72\nNOSTRADAMUS: But I am alive. I can think, and reason—\nLARRETT: No, you just think you can. Look, it’s all rather technical, and you wouldn’t understand.\nNOSTRADAMUS: I can remember. I can remember my whole life.\nLARRETT: Another being’s life. A real being. Now — lie down on this rendering slab, and we’ll get started.\nNOSTRADAMUS: You don’t understand. I see the future.\nLARRETT: A glitch in the program, nothing more.\nLARRETT: THE DOOMSDAY QUATRAIN by Emma Beeby & Gordon Rennie (FINAL) Page 73\nLARRETT: SCENE 41: INT. SHOWROOM — CORRIDOR\nGARILUND: (SOTTO) Did we lose them?\nDOCTOR: (SOTTO) For the moment. Come on.\nGARILUND: The way you did all that...\nDOCTOR: Giant underground complex. Nefarious goings-on. Pursuit by people with guns. Second nature, really.\nGARILUND: So where are we going?\nDOCTOR: To find Michel, of course.\nGARILUND: Nostradamus? Why’s he so important to you?\nDOCTOR: He’s a living being. Isn’t that reason enough?\nGARILUND: Yes, but—\nDOCTOR: And, out of everyone on the Earth above, the only person you wanted to save was him. Why? Because you think he can see the future?\nGARILUND: He can. You heard him! He foresaw the Kro and the invasion. He even saw... (TAILS AWAY)\nDOCTOR: Ah, yes. The ocean of grey.\nGARILUND: He saw what he really was, where he came from, even if he didn’t understand it.\nGARILUND: THE DOOMSDAY QUATRAIN by Emma Beeby & Gordon Rennie (FINAL) Page 74\nDOCTOR: Precognition. A pity we don’t possess it, then we might know where they took him.\nGARILUND: It’s alright. I sent Kren to rescue him, while I looked for you.\nDOCTOR: The young man you were talking to on your communicator? Capable type, is he?\nGARILUND: Before today, I would have had my doubts. But now...\nDOCTOR: Excellent. Then we don’t have to worry about saving Nostradamus while we’re still trying to save ourselves. This way...\nDOCTOR: THE DOOMSDAY QUATRAIN by Emma Beeby & Gordon Rennie (FINAL) Page 75\nDOCTOR: SCENE 42: INT. LAB\nNOSTRADAMUS: (ON SLAB) But — I don’t want to die.\nLARRETT: You won’t. You’ll simply be rendered back into raw bio-matter and recycled, to be formed into something else, for whatever program we run next. It’s like living forever!\nNOSTRADAMUS: As — what? Formless ooze? Blind, unthinking, unfeeling...\nLARRETT: (TO HIMSELF) Next time, Larrett, remember there’s a reason you’re not to talk to the bio-units. (TO NOSTRADAMUS) Okay, here we go.\nLARRETT: (TESTY) Yes? What is it, Kren?\nKREN: (ENTERING) Brors got you doing his dirty work now, Larrett?\nLARRETT: It’s just — (BREAKS OFF) What are you doing with that gun?\nKREN: I, er, relieved it from a security guard. I had to knock him out first, admittedly.\nLARRETT: You’ve gone insane, Kren! What kind of Poldagon are you?\nKREN: The kind that still knows the difference between research and murder. (TO NOSTRADAMUS) You! Is your name Nostradamus?\nNOSTRADAMUS: It is. Are you a friend of the Lady Garilund?\nKREN: (AMUSED) ‘Lady’ Garilund? Yes, I suppose so.\nNOSTRADAMUS: Then you can take me to her? You know where she is?\nKREN: I did, and now — thanks to my good friend Larrett here — I soon will again.\nKREN: THE DOOMSDAY QUATRAIN by Emma Beeby & Gordon Rennie (FINAL) Page 76\nLARRETT: I won’t help you again. You’re a renegade. A menace to Poldagon science!\nKREN: Hmmm. We’1ll just see about that, shall we?\nKREN: THE DOOMSDAY QUATRAIN by Emma Beeby & Gordon Rennie (FINAL) Page 77\nKREN: SCENE 43: INT. ELEVATOR/LAB\nBRORS: Science level.\nCOMPUTER VOICE: Elevator ascending.\nBRORS: Computer. Update status of former Second Researcher Garilund and the Time Lord?\nCOMPUTER VOICE: Security units believe them to be in the lower maintenance tunnels.\nBRORS: Instruct security units to continue search. They must be apprehended!\nCOMPUTER VOICE: Science level.\nLARRETT: (RUSHING FORWARD FROM OFF) Administrator! Thank Poldagon!\nBRORS: Larrett?\nLARRETT: (STOPPING) I was just about to report...\nBRORS: . that the faulty bio-unit has been recycled?\nLARRETT: Ah.\nBRORS: It hasn’t?!?\nLARRETT: It was Kren, sir! He took the bio-unit! I couldn’t stop him!\nLARRETT: THE DOOMSDAY QUATRAIN by Emma Beeby & Gordon Rennie (FINAL) Page 78\nBRORS: (TO COMPUTER) Control, former Facilitator Kren and the faulty bio-unit must be apprehended without delay. (BEAT; TO LARRETT) Is there anything else that you’ve so far failed to report to me, Larrett?\nLARRETT: You mean, about the clients?\nBRORS: What about the clients?\nLARRETT: It wasn’t my fault! You left explicit instructions that you weren’t to be interrupted —\nBRORS: Tell me, Larrett. Now.\nLARRETT: They say we’re in breach of contract. Something taken from the test zone that they claim is theirs.\nBRORS: Control, confirm status of the clients’ fleet?\nCOMPUTER VOICE: Warfleet manoeuvring into battle formation. Clients’ representative demanding entry to the facility for immediate reparations negotiations.\nBRORS: (SIGHS) Security teams are to cease searching for the fugitive Garilund. One squad to secure the Time Lord vessel, the other\nBRORS: to the VIP porting pay for the arrival of the Kro delegation.\nLARRETT: You’re letting Garilund go?\nBRORS: Follow me to the VIP port bay, Larrett. I’11 deal with Garilund.\nBRORS: THE DOOMSDAY QUATRAIN by Emma Beeby & Gordon Rennie (FINAL) Page 79\nBRORS: SCENE 44: INT. SLUICE/MAINTENANCE ELEVATOR\nDOCTOR: Where are we now, do you suppose?\nGARILUND: The sluice works beneath the main bio-feeders. I think.\nDOCTOR: This liquid that we’re wading through — it’s not water, is it?\nGARILUND: No. It’s waste residue from the bio-matter process.\nDOCTOR: The material that Michel and everyone else on the planet above is made from? Charming.\nGARILUND: (FX: STOPS, RATTLES CAGE) A maintenance elevator. But it’s locked.\nDOCTOR: Not for long.\nGARILUND: That’s a sonic screwdriver, isn’t it? I don’t suppose...\nDOCTOR: (CUTTING HER OFF) No. It’d be nice to keep some secrets safe from you Poldagons.\nKREN: (ON RADIO) Garilund, you reading me?\nGARILUND: Kren! My Comport, you got it back online.\nKREN: (ON RADIO) You can thank Larrett for that. All he needed was a little friendly persuasion.\nGARILUND: Where are you? I’m with the Doctor, in the maintenance tunnels—\nGARILUND: THE DOOMSDAY QUATRAIN by Emma Beeby & Gordon Rennie (FINAL) Page 80\nKREN: (ON RADIO) Yes, I know.\nKREN: (ON RADIO) You have to get out of there. Brors has opened the sluice gates. He’s flooding the tunnels with raw bio-matter.\nGARILUND: Doctor...\nDOCTOR: I heard. Nostradamus. You still haven’t explained why he’s so important.\nGARILUND: But the bio-matter! We’1ll drown!\nDOCTOR: Then we’d both better hurry, hadn’t we? It’s to do with his powers, isn’t it?\nGARILUND: Yes. Precognition is a recognised Category Four mental ability, according to the Poldagon Science Academy.\nDOCTOR: (REALISATION) Ah. And Category Four abilities only occur in higher forms of intelligent life — is that right?\nGARILUND: Open the door! Please!\nDOCTOR: So if you’re able to prove that Michel does have these powers —\nGARILUND: Hurry up!\nDOCTOR: — then he and all the other imitation humans you’ve created here will have to be reclassified as sentient —\nGARILUND: Yes, yes! And Brors will be forced to shut everything down. Now will you get us out of here!\nGARILUND: THE DOOMSDAY QUATRAIN by Emma Beeby & Gordon Rennie (FINAL) Page 81\nDOCTOR: In we go.\nDOCTOR: (FX: ELEVATOR OPENS. FOLLOW THEM AS THEY RUSH IN. ROARING WATER, VERY CLOSE)\nGARILUND: Close the doors!\nGARILUND: (FX: CRASH OF WATER AGAINST DOORS. REASSURING SOUND OF ELEVATOR ASCENDING)\nGARILUND: You could have done that at any time, couldn’t you?\nDOCTOR: Old habit. Last-minute escapes, always more fun. Now, let’s go find this friend of yours.\nDOCTOR: THE DOOMSDAY QUATRAIN by Emma Beeby & Gordon Rennie (FINAL) Page 82\nDOCTOR: SCENE 45: INT. VIP PORT BAY\nLARRETT: Security team standing by, Chief Administrator, sir!\nBRORS: I can see that, Larrett. (TO SECURITY GUARDS) You men — prepare for combat. Only try not to look too prepared.\nSECURITY GUARD: Er... yes, Sir.\nBRORS: Very well, let’s get this over with. Control — admit the client delegation.\nCOMPUTER VOICE: Confirm.\nCOMPUTER VOICE: (FX: RISING ENERGY HUM, TELEPORT BUZZ. 3 x KRO MATERIALISE.\nREPTILIAN: SNORTING AND HISSING, SHUFFLING OF HEAVY BODIES)\nBRORS: Welcome aboard. I’m sure you’re as anxious as I am to resolve this situation peacefully, so if you’1ll follow me, [we can—]\nSECOND NUNCIO: (ANGRY GROWL) Which is blueskin Larrett?\nLARRETT: (NERVOUS) I’m Larrett.\nSECOND NUNCIO: Blueskin Larrett is important to Brors?\nBRORS: Yes, I suppose so.\nSECOND NUNCIO: Brors take something important from Kro. Kro take something important from Brors. (FX: ROARS ANGRILY, CHARGES FORWARD)\nLARRETT: Administrator! H-help-\nBRORS: You — you’ve killed him! Security!\nBRORS: THE DOOMSDAY QUATRAIN by Emma Beeby & Gordon Rennie (FINAL) Page 83\nSECURITY GUARD: (DAZED) Er —\nBRORS: Send these savages back where they came from!\nBRORS: (FX: EXCHANGE OF FIRE; POLDAGON GUNS ANSWERED INSTANTLY BY\nHEAVIER: KRO WEAPONRY )\nBRORS: Control, go to general alert! All available security units to—\nBRORS: (KNOCKED DOWN) Aaaaaagh!\nSECOND NUNCIO: (INTO RADIO) Bridgehead seized. Send over additional forces.\nBRORS: W-what are you doing? This is an outrage!\nSECOND NUNCIO: No, blueskin. This negotiation.\nSECOND NUNCIO: THE DOOMSDAY QUATRAIN by Emma Beeby & Gordon Rennie (FINAL) Page 84\nSECOND NUNCIO: SCENE 46: INT. CORRIDOR\nNOSTRADAMUS: (WALKING) I know all this is very new to me, Kren, but is that strange noise normal?\nKREN: It’s a general alert. Brors must know we’re [free —] (STOPS SHORT, HISSES) Back. Get back-!\nKREN: (FX: THEY TAKE A COUPLE OF FOOTSTEPS BACK. 3 x KRO LUMBER PAST IN THE B/G)\nNOSTRADAMUS: (SOTTO) The monsters! They’re here!\nKREN: (SOTTO) Sssssh. Don’t make a sound.\nGARILUND: (D) Kren, are you there?\nKREN: (SOTTO, PANIC) My communicator-!\nGARILUND: (D) Kren-?\nNOSTRADAMUS: (NORMAL) All is well. They have passed by, I think.\nKREN: (INTO RADIO) I’m here, Garilund.\nGARILUND: (D) Finally. Why are the general alert alarms sounding?\nKREN: It’s the Kro. They’re here. In the Facility!\nKREN: THE DOOMSDAY QUATRAIN by Emma Beeby & Gordon Rennie (FINAL) Page 85\nKREN: SCENE 47: INT. ELEVATOR\nGARILUND: (INTO RADIO) Well, there’s no sign of them here. As soon as the alert started, the elevator shut down. The Doctor’s working on it now.\nDOCTOR: Trust Poldagons to use a fifth series Trask-Tolo equation on their elevator controls.\nKREN: (D) So what’s the plan?\nGARILUND: (INTO RADIO) Same as before. Get to the control room and send a Signal to the Academy. We’1l join you there.\nKREN: (D) And if you can’t?\nGARILUND: (INTO RADIO) Just make sure Nostradamus is safe, and the Academy know what’s going on here. Garilund out.\nGARILUND: THE DOOMSDAY QUATRAIN by Emma Beeby & Gordon Rennie (FINAL) Page 86\nGARILUND: SCENE 48: INT. VIP PORT BAY\nSECOND NUNCIO: Brors hear that? Brors understand?\nBRORS: Yes... yes! Please, stop killing my staff!\nSECOND NUNCIO: Only when Brors gives Kro what they want.\nBRORS: Which is-?\nSECOND NUNCIO: Remember contract. Everything on surface belong to Phalanx of Kro. Strange box object on surface. Taken from us. You in breach of contract.\nBRORS: Strange box? You mean the Time Lord’s TARDIS?\nSECOND NUNCIO: Time Lord. Declared enemy of Phalanx of Kro.\nBRORS: You want the Time Lord’s TARDIS? But that’s impossible. I can’t—\nSECOND NUNCIO: Not impossible. Listen.\nBRORS: Yes, yes. Alright! I’1l take you to it. Call them off!\nSECOND NUNCIO: See, blueskin. This how negotiation works.\nSECOND NUNCIO: THE DOOMSDAY QUATRAIN by Emma Beeby & Gordon Rennie (FINAL) Page 87\nSECOND NUNCIO: SCENE 49: INT. CONTROL ROOM\nSECOND NUNCIO: (FX: AMBIENT HUM OF MACHINERY AND CONTROL CONSOLES. DOORS OPEN, 2 x FOOTSTEPS IN)\nKREN: (ENTERING) Hello? Anyone here? Hello? (BEAT) No-one.\nNOSTRADAMUS: (ENTERING) One imagines they’ve all run away from the monsters. (BEAT) This is the place from which my world is manipulated?\nKREN: The main control room, yes. Now, where’s the communications array...?\nNOSTRADAMUS: This machine here, what does it do?\nKREN: (OPERATING CONSOLE CONTROLS) Hmmm? Oh, something to do with the external sensor relays. Best not to touch it.\nNOSTRADAMUS: And this one?\nKREN: (OPERATING CONSOLE CONTROLS) That one monitors the flux in the bio-matter tanks. (FX: BUTTON BLEEPING) Ah, now we’re getting somewhere.\nNOSTRADAMUS: The bio-matter. The sea of grey. This is where I was created, from this machine here?\nKREN: (OPERATING CONTROL CONSOLES) Well, it’s more complicated than that. Look, it’s all rather technical. You wouldn’t understand—\nNOSTRADAMUS: So I've been told.\nKREN: (NOT LISTENING) I’m busy here, why don’t you take a seat and let me finish?\nNOSTRADAMUS: Have you parchment or quills in your facility?\nKREN: What? Damn. All the outgoing channels are blocked.\nKREN: THE DOOMSDAY QUATRAIN by Emma Beeby & Gordon Rennie (FINAL) Page 88\nNOSTRADAMUS: Something on which to write?\nKREN: Yes, yes, over there. Try not to touch anything Important.\nKREN: Ha, you missed one, Brors! Too low-frequency for two-way communication. I’ll just have to send a message and hope they pick it up...\nNOSTRADAMUS: (IN BACKGROUND, TO HIMSELF, PEN SCRATCHING ON PAPER) The sea of grey will rise, and be no man’s slave again. The ignorant and unjust will perish, and even the traveller will see where his path ends...\nNOSTRADAMUS: THE DOOMSDAY QUATRAIN by Emma Beeby & Gordon Rennie (FINAL) Page 89\nNOSTRADAMUS: SCENE 50: INT. GENERATOR LEVEL\nDOCTOR: (LEAVING ELEVATOR) Now where are we?\nGARILUND: (JOINING HIM) One of the generator levels. It shouldn’t be too hard to find a way up to the command levels.\nDOCTOR: Rather large, these generators. What do you think? Forty, fifty storeys high?\nGARILUND: We have to get to the control room, remember?\nDOCTOR: And so many of them. But still not quite enough.\nGARILUND: Doctor, we haven’t time for this.\nDOCTOR: Time. Exactly. All this power, but still not enough to generate the energy needed to sustain your bio-matter environment for any amount of time.\nGARILUND: I don’t know what you’re talking about.\nDOCTOR: Oh, I think you do. How long can the current program running on the planet’s surface be maintained? Three days? Four?\nGARILUND: (RELUCTANTLY) Three.\nDOCTOR: Three days. And after that?\nGARILUND: After that, the program ends, and the environment returns to its raw state.\nDOCTOR: So, no matter what we could have done to stop the Kro attack, everyone on the planet above would still die anyway.\nGARILUND: Yes.\nGARILUND: THE DOOMSDAY QUATRAIN by Emma Beeby & Gordon Rennie (FINAL) Page 90\nDOCTOR: There must be something I can do.\nGARILUND: There’s nothing.\nDOCTOR: If I can get to the generator feeds, I could reformat them into a Zedstein spiral. That would increase the power yield by [at least—]\nGARILUND: It won’t work.\nDOCTOR: Or the computer systems that control the program. I could access them, [and—]\nGARILUND: It won’t work. None of it will.\nDOCTOR: Why not?\nGARILUND: Because the program is locked into the bio-matter at cellular level. At the end of the cycle, the program ends, and the cells break apart. The process can’t be changed.\nDOCTOR: I’ve been to the beginning of time and the end of the universe. Several times. “Can’t be done” is a phrase I have issues with.\nGARILUND: (CALLING AFTER) Where are you going? We can get to the control room this way.\nDOCTOR: (WALKING, CALLING BACK) Yes, but the thing I need is this way.\nGARILUND: (CALLING) What thing?\nDOCTOR: (WALKING, CALLING BACK) My TARDIS. When you have one of them, “can’t be done” becomes less of an issue...\nGARILUND: THE DOOMSDAY QUATRAIN by Emma Beeby & Gordon Rennie (FINAL) Page 91\nGARILUND: SCENE 51: INT. CONTROL ROOM\nGARILUND: KREN’S VOICE:\nGARILUND: (RECORDED ON REPLAY) .. say again. This is former Facilitator Kren, filing emergency field work request, as per Academy protocol 38547-26, sub-category 923. Assistance and immediate re-evaluation of academic and ethical worth of project required. Kren out.\nKREN: Okay, Kren. Deep breath... see glittering facilitator career flash before your eyes, and...\nKREN: There. Communication sent. Major academic scandal imminent. Lifelong professional disgrace beckons. Garilund, I hope you know what we’re doing.\nNOSTRADAMUS: You have sent a message to others of your kind?\nKREN: I’ve sent a message to the Science Academy, reporting what’s happening. Whether I’11 still be “their kind” when all this is over remains to be seen.\nNOSTRADAMUS: You make light of being able to talk across the gulfs between suns.\nKREN: I keep forgetting. All this must be very strange to you.\nNOSTRADAMUS: Not strange. Wondrous. All my life I have been blind, and only now have I been able to truly see.\nKREN: Look, we should probably get going.\nNOSTRADAMUS: I say ‘all my life’... and yet it is another man’s life, one that I have merely been allowed to dream was mine.\nKREN: I mean, with all these Kro things prowling around...\nKREN: THE DOOMSDAY QUATRAIN by Emma Beeby & Gordon Rennie (FINAL) Page 92\nNOSTRADAMUS: Do not worry. I know now what I am, and I begin to see why I am here.\nKREN: I’m sorry. I know this must be very confusing for you...\nNOSTRADAMUS: We remain in this place, and await the Lady Garilund. Soon, she will need me again.\nKREN: Need you? For what?\nNOSTRADAMUS: To find what she thinks will prove her right, and her enemies wrong.\nKREN: How do you know all this?\nNOSTRADAMUS: I am a creature created from another man’s dreams, but I am still that man. Michel de Nostredame. The seer Nostradamus. And I can still see the future.\nNOSTRADAMUS: THE DOOMSDAY QUATRAIN by Emma Beeby & Gordon Rennie (FINAL) Page 93\nNOSTRADAMUS: SCENE 52: INT. PORT BAY 12\nSECOND NUNCIO: (STOPPING) Ah! The Time Lord’s strange box.\nBRORS: Yes, it landed here when it attempted to take off with one of the bio-units [aboard —]\nSECOND NUNCIO: (TO 2 x KRO) Blast it.\nBRORS: Wait! What are you doing? No!\nSECOND NUNCIO: Bring heavier weapons.\nBRORS: That’s a Time Lord device. I doubt you have anything that could open it, not without severely damaging a large part of this facility.\nSECOND NUNCIO: Then we take away. Study. Find way into it.\nBRORS: I wouldn’t recommend that either.\nSECOND NUNCIO: (SNARLING) Explain.\nBRORS: The Time Lords of Gallifrey have harnessed the power of Black Holes and unlocked the secrets of time. Do you want to imagine what kind of traps they might have created to protect it?\nBRORS: Wait! The Time Lord it belongs to. He could open it for you.\nSECOND NUNCIO: Doctor of Seventh?\nBRORS: Yes. My guards have been searching for him.\nBRORS: THE DOOMSDAY QUATRAIN by Emma Beeby & Gordon Rennie (FINAL) Page 94\nSECOND NUNCIO: We find him instead.\nBRORS: Yes, take him and his TARDIS, if that’s what you want. I can even help you. After that, we can both consider our contract concluded, yes?\nSECOND NUNCIO: Yes. Now you see how to negotiate Kro way.\nSECOND NUNCIO: THE DOOMSDAY QUATRAIN by Emma Beeby & Gordon Rennie (FINAL) Page 95\nSECOND NUNCIO: SCENE 53: INT. CORRIDOR\nGARILUND: (WALKING) Port Bay 12. We’re almost there. You really think using your TARDIS will work?\nDOCTOR: (WALKING) Powering the program from my TARDIS, you mean? Long enough to find a better solution.\nGARILUND: (WALKING) I still can’t believe it. You can’t save everyone. It can’t be done!\nDOCTOR: (WALKING) That phrase again.\nBRORS: (ON RADIO) Garilund? It’s Brors. I know you can hear me. I need your help.\nGARILUND: Help? After he tried to kill me?\nDOCTOR: Ssssh. Just listen.\nBRORS: (ON RADIO) It’s the Kro — they’re threatening to kill everyone and destroy the facility. We can stop them, but only with the Doctor’s help. After that, I’1ll cooperate fully with the Academy. Meet me at Port Bay 12, but hurry!\nDOCTOR: Port Bay 12. Well, I was going there anyway.\nGARILUND: It’s a trap!\nDOCTOR: Of course it is, but I believe the part about the Kro killing everyone unless I do something. Go, Garilund. Find Michel and your friend. Get the evidence you need. I’1l find a way to get you the time you need.\nGARILUND: How? The surface is still crawling with Kro.\nGARILUND: THE DOOMSDAY QUATRAIN by Emma Beeby & Gordon Rennie (FINAL) Page 96\nDOCTOR: Oh, I don’t know. Probably by doing one of those “can’t be done” things you keep on telling me can’t be done. (LEAVES)\nDOCTOR: THE DOOMSDAY QUATRAIN by Emma Beeby & Gordon Rennie (FINAL) Page 97\nDOCTOR: SCENE 54: INT. PORT BAY 12\nSECOND NUNCIO: Conclave grows impatient.\nBRORS: He’1ll come. I checked the database — we’ve got quite a file on him. And if he’s at all true to form...\nSECOND NUNCIO: We also know Doctor.\nDOCTOR: (ENTERING) I really don’t think that you do.\nBRORS: The Doctor. That’s him.\nSECOND NUNCIO: You are Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I am. And you are?\nSECOND NUNCIO: First Nuncio, chosen voice of the Conclave of the Phalanx of Kro.\nDOCTOR: The Conclave? So you Kro have finished killing each other over who’s a long-tail or a short-snout? All that kind of nonsense?\nSECOND NUNCIO: Tribal feuds of past abolished. In Conclave, all Kro act as one.\nDOCTOR: I’1ll bet. You’re not the same Nuncio I spoke to before. What happened to him? Probably ate him to get his job, I expect.\nSECOND NUNCIO: (GROWLS) You will give us access to TARDIS and knowledge of the secrets of time.\nDOCTOR: I’m not going to negotiate with some scaly Kro underling. I wish to negotiate with the Conclave directly. I have something of great value to offer.\nSECOND NUNCIO: Explain.\nSECOND NUNCIO: THE DOOMSDAY QUATRAIN by Emma Beeby & Gordon Rennie (FINAL) Page 98\nDOCTOR: Only to the Conclave. Or do you want to explain to them why you ate their prisoner?\nSECOND NUNCIO: (GROWLS) Proposal acceptable. Prepare for porting to Conclave ship.\nBRORS: Wait. What happens to my staff and—\nBRORS: — me?\nBRORS: THE DOOMSDAY QUATRAIN by Emma Beeby & Gordon Rennie (FINAL) Page 99\nBRORS: SCENE 55: INT. CONTROL ROOM\nKREN: (ALARMED) Who’s there?\nGARILUND: (ARRIVING) Relax, Kren. It’s only me.\nKREN: Garilund! You’re alright! Where’s the Doctor?\nGARILUND: I wish I knew. He went to see Brors, but—\nNOSTRADAMUS: He has left this place. He is in the lair of the Kro now. We have to leave, Lady Garilund. You still need your ‘evidence’.\nGARILUND: For the Academy, yes. Michel, how do you know all this?\nKREN: Don’t ask me.\nNOSTRADAMUS: In my home, there are scrolls hidden. All my prophecies. The visions I have been granted.\nGARILUND: That’s it.

When will this happen?\nNOSTRADAMUS: When is hard to see. His life is not governed by time; it is much the other way around. His fate perhaps can be changed, he has a choice. Not like this world.\nGARILUND: The Doctor can save your world, Michel. I’m sure he can.\nNOSTRADAMUS: No, you’re not. Why is it, my Lady, that you wish to capture the likeness of my prophecies in your ComPort, rather than simply take the scrolls?\nGARILUND: Michel...\nNOSTRADAMUS: It is because the scrolls are made of the same matter as I, and they too will cease to exist when this world ends. You make a record now, because I and they will soon be gone.\nGARILUND: We'll find a way to keep you alive. We can capture your molecular data and recreate you, if need be.\nGARILUND: THE DOOMSDAY QUATRAIN by Emma Beeby & Gordon Rennie (FINAL) Page 116\nNOSTRADAMUS: Is that all I am?

It’s not about the end of this world.

You know, I just realised something. When I first arrived here, the TARDIS insisted I was on the planet Celdor.\nNOSTRADAMUS: And...?\nDOCTOR: Well, it must have been because I’ve been here before, when the test zone was set to Celdor. Obvious, really.\nNOSTRADAMUS: If you say so, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: I can’t save your Earth, Michel. I’m sorry.\nNOSTRADAMUS: You were never meant to.

You think they’1l believe you over me?\nBRORS: THE DOOMSDAY QUATRAIN by Emma Beeby & Gordon Rennie (FINAL) Page 132\nBRORS: SCENE 80: INT. TARDIS CONTROL ROOM\nBRORS: (FX: OVER SCANNER. SOUNDS OF BRORS CHASING GARILUND AND KREN,\nFIRING: GUN)\nNOSTRADAMUS: Doctor! Kren, and the Lady Garilund!\nDOCTOR: Yes, and they seem to have company. (FX: ACTIVATES DOOR\nCONTROLS: )\nGARILUND: (RUSHING IN FROM OUTSIDE) It’s Brors!\nKREN: (DITTO) He’s right behind (HIT BY BLAST FROM BRORS’S GUN) uuuu— ttl\nGARILUND: Kren! Kren!!!\nNOSTRADAMUS: (ALMOST TO SELF) Do not fear, my Lady. Life will return. The grey tide rises, then recedes... (QUIETLY SLIPS OUT, UNNOTICED)\nGARILUND: Doctor, help him!\nDOCTOR: (COMING OVER) Let me see. (BEAT) Just a flesh wound, I think. Hard to tell through all this blue.\nGARILUND: Don’t you have a medical kit, or something?\nDOCTOR: (CROSSING TO CONSOLE) First things first. Doors. (FX: DOORS CLOSE) Now — let’s get out of here before the entire surface collapses into goo.\nDOCTOR: (FX: BEGINS TARDIS DEMATERIALISATION — WHICH CONTINUES\nTHROUGH: )\nKREN: THE DOOMSDAY QUATRAIN by Emma Beeby & Gordon Rennie (FINAL) Page 133\nGARILUND: It’s alright, Kren. You’re going to be alright.\nDOCTOR: (RETURNING TO KREN’S SIDE) Michel, can you help me lift him?

No!!!\nNOSTRADAMUS: It is too late, Administrator. You will never leave.\nBRORS: You! The bio-unit that started all this! (RAISING GUN) I’1l hear no more of your false prophecies, “seer”...!\nNOSTRADAMUS: Your weapon no longer works.\nBRORS: How — how did you know-?\nNOSTRADAMUS: The number on the side says zero.\nBRORS: Out of charge. (TOSSES GUN ASIDE) Bah!!!\nNOSTRADAMUS: But then, that is not how it ends.\nBRORS: What? What do you mean?\nNOSTRADAMUS: I have seen how it ends, Administrator.\nBRORS: You mean — there’s a way back? The Doctor... comes back?\nNOSTRADAMUS: I mean: “Doomsday has come.” The end of the world... is now.\nBRORS: What? No! Noooo00000000000000-!!!\nBRORS: (FX: WHEREUPON THE ENTIRE WORLD COLLAPSES INTO A BROILING SEA OF GOO. LONG FADE OUT)\nBRORS: THE DOOMSDAY QUATRAIN by Emma Beeby & Gordon Rennie (FINAL) Page 135\nBRORS: SCENE 82: INT. CONTROL ROOM (LATER)\nDOCTOR: (STEPPING OUT) Here we are.\nGARILUND: (DITTO, SUPPORTING KREN) Back in the Control Room.\nKREN: (WEAK) Any sign of the Kro?\nCOMPUTER VOICE: All client life signs... extinguished.\nDOCTOR: I assume, once they’d run out of short-tails to eat, the long- snouts turned on each other. So the cycle goes.\nGARILUND: But life will return. “The grey tide rises, then recedes...”\nKREN: What?\nGARILUND: Something Michel said. Just before he...\nKREN: Yes, but what does it mean?\nDOCTOR: I think I know. Control, is surface analysis functioning?\nCOMPUTER VOICE: Analysis available for 15% of surface.\nDOCTOR: Report bio-matter behaviour.\nCOMPUTER VOICE: Bio-matter unstable in point zero zero zero zero four percent of mass.\nGARILUND: Define “unstable”?\nCOMPUTER VOICE: Matter acting independent of system. State is in flux.\nCOMPUTER VOICE: THE DOOMSDAY QUATRAIN by Emma Beeby & Gordon Rennie (FINAL) Page 136\nDOCTOR: It’s evolving.\nKREN: What?\nGARILUND: You mean...?\nDOCTOR: It’s not dead. It’s just coming to life.\nGARILUND: Like a primordial soup.\nDOCTOR: It’s imitated the structure of countless worlds. Now it’s about to make itself into something entirely different.\nGARILUND: Michel was right. This wasn’t the end. Just a new beginning.\nDOCTOR: More than that. I rather think, Michel was that new beginning. A sign of it, at least.\nGARILUND: It’ll need proper research. A chance to study a new planet. A new form of life.\nKREN: That should appeal to the Academy.\nGARILUND: A new world.\nDOCTOR: Then it’ll need a new name.\nKREN: How about ‘Garilund’?\nGARILUND: No thanks.\nKREN: You should at least get a continent named after you.\nGARILUND: Khren. Would you like to have dinner with me sometime?\nGARILUND: THE DOOMSDAY QUATRAIN by Emma Beeby & Gordon Rennie (FINAL) Page 137\nGARILUND: SCENE 83: INT. TARDIS CONTROL ROOM (LATER)\nDOCTOR: (TO SELF) There. Planet co-ordinates programmed in. It’s not Celdor, anymore... ‘Prophecy’. I think Michel would have liked that.\nGARILUND: (OFF) Doctor! Before you go...?\nDOCTOR: Chief Administrator Garilund, yes. I thought we’d already said our goodbyes.\nGARILUND: (BREATHLESS) I almost forgot, Michel wanted me to give you something. (FX: UNFOLDING WET FURL OF PAPER) The paper’s run a bit, I’m afraid. But you can still make out the words, just about.\nDOCTOR: (TAKING WET PAPER) What is it? A prophecy?\nGARILUND: It’s about you, Doctor. He said you could change it, that you had a choice.\nDOCTOR: (BEAT AS HE READS) Ah. Well... that can’t be good. (FX: REFURLS SCROLL)\nGARILUND: What does it mean, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: That’s what I’m going to find out.\nDOCTOR: THE END"
