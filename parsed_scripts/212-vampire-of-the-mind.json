It is rather a small island.\nBOATMAN: It’s not like there’s many places they could end up. There’s the pub. A small shop. Then there’s Dominus.\nDOCTOR: You must have thought about this. What’s your theory, might I ask?\nBOATMAN: All I can think is that they use another boat for some journeys.\nDOCTOR: That’s certainly possible. Quite likely, in fact.\nBOATMAN: But like I said, it’s asmall island. Everyone knows everyone else’s business.\nDOCTOR: I can imagine.\nBOATMAN: So why don’t I know about no other boat?

Oh. Another prisoner.\nHEATHER: Unconscious. But why’s he strapped to the table? Were they going to operate on him, do you think?\nDOCTOR: Or monitor him, perhaps? He’s wired up to all this — “stuff”.\nHEATHER: He’s got that same gaunt, pale look that those others had.\nDOCTOR: You know, this equipment is rather advanced. Too advanced for Earth in this time period, certainly.\nHEATHER: We should help him.\nDOCTOR: What? — Oh yes. Let’s get the poor fellow unstrapped. You detach those wires and electrodes.\nHEATHER: Done it. Now what?\nHEATHER: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 55\nDOCTOR: I think he’s waking up.\nBLANK: Must obey... obey... obey...\nHEATHER: Perhaps he can tell us who did this and what’s going on.\nDOCTOR: I don’t think there can be much doubt that our friend Damien is involved somehow.\nDOCTOR: (CONT’D) Easy now, easy does it.\nHEATHER: Look out, Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Woah!\nHEATHER: He’s mad!\nEFFORT: We're trying to help.

There was nothing else you could have done. You saw how he was. The question now is, what happened to make him like that, and to weaken his body so that a minor injury could kill him?\nHEATHER: And who was he?\nDOCTOR: From this equipment, I’d say he was something to do with Damien Scott’s memory project. Somehow this man’s memories - in fact his whole personality - were removed.\nHEATHER: Leaving him like that. Like a vicious animal.\nDOCTOR: Terrified more likely. An empty shell working merely on instinct. A template... a ‘blank’.\nHEATHER: Poor man.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Ah, well at least we know his name.\nHEATHER: What’s that?\nDOCTOR: An identity badge. It was stuffed in his pocket.\nDOCTOR: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 57\nHEATHER: Who was he?\nDOCTOR: According to this.. Kenneth Albrecht.\nHEATHER: One of the missing scientists.\nDOCTOR: And what's the betting that those other people we saw are also missing scientists?\nHEATHER: With their minds blanked.\nDOCTOR: As you say. Except they were working to some purpose, not just instinctive. As if they’d been, I don’t know, programmed somehow.\nHEATHER: Is that possible?\nDOCTOR: Anything’s possible. Here, give me a hand.\nHEATHER: What are we doing?\nDOCTOR: I want to get Kenneth here back on the table, strapped down and wired\nDOCTOR: Up\nDOCTOR: Ooh, he’s heavier than he looks.\nHEATHER: So we're making it look like whatever was happening to him just failed, and that’s what killed him?\nDOCTOR: That’s right. If you can just reconnect those wires there... No point in advertising that we’ve been here.\nHEATHER: I guess not. And what then?\nDOCTOR: Then we follow those other ‘blanks’ and see where they went.\nDOCTOR: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 58\nDOCTOR: (FADE IN:\nDOCTOR: THE DOCTOR AND HEATHER ARE MAKING THEIR WAY CAUTIOUSLY ALONG. )\nHEATHER: Where do you think this tunnel leads?\nDOCTOR: I’m not sure.

FADE IT UP AS THEY GET CLOSER. )\nHEATHER: Good point... Can you hear that?\nDOCTOR: Yes. It sounds like the sea.\nHEATHER: It is the sea. Look - there’s the end of the tunnel. It comes out on a beach.\nCUT TO: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 59\nDOCTOR: You were right. We’re in a cave. A cave at the bottom of the cliffs, I suspect.\nHEATHER: I suppose we should have guessed. It’s a small island after all.\nDOCTOR: Yes, you see I was right. Cliffs. Even so, I wonder where we are.\nHEATHER: And where those ‘blank’ people went.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Let’s see if we can find a way up to the top.\nHEATHER: That could be a path over there. It doesn’t look too steep.\nDOCTOR: Well spotted. With luck when we get to the top we’1ll see something we recognise...\nFADE OUT: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 60\nFADE OUT: (FADE IN:\nFADE OUT: LOUDLY TO BE HEARD.)\nHEATHER: I can’t see the Institute, but I’d guess it’s that way.\nDOCTOR: I think you’re right.\nHEATHER: What’s that, over there? It looks like a small castle.\nDOCTOR: A bit too modern for that, I think. A folly of some sort perhaps... Although...\nHEATHER: Although? What is it, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I’mnot sure. But there’s something. Something about that place that seems vaguely familiar.\nHEATHER: You recognise it?\nDOCTOR: I certainly have the feeling I’ve seen it before, but I can’t quite place it.\nHEATHER: Maybe you’ve seen pictures.\nDOCTOR: Maybe.\nHEATHER: Was it on the Dominus website? There were some shots of the island.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Yes, maybe that was it.\nHEATHER: So back to the Institute?\nDOCTOR: Unless you have a better suggestion?\nDOCTOR: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 61\nHEATHER: The evening’s drawing in. I could do with something to eat. Though Gobernar said the canteen’s closed, didn’t he?\nDOCTOR: Yes, but he did mention a pub.\nHEATHER: That’s a point. He said we can get food there.\nDOCTOR: And the other thing you can always get in a pub, is...\nHEATHER: Drinks?\nDOCTOR: Information.\nHEATHER: Ah. Right.\nDOCTOR: Though I’m sure we can get a drink as well. Now, if the Institute is that way, then from what our friendly boatman told me, the pub should be over there.\nFADE OUT: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 62\nFADE OUT: (FADE IN:\nGOBERNAR: No, no, I quite understand. Thank you for letting me know... Yes, yes, please do. Good bye.\nMASTER: The nursing home, I presume?\nGOBERNAR: Yes.\nMASTER: Your sister continues to deteriorate.\nGOBERNAR: I’m afraid so. Is there any chance, Damien — do you think?\nMASTER: Andrew, Andrew... There is every chance. You know how well the experiments are going, the results we have achieved.\nGOBERNAR: Yes. It’s just that there’s so little time. I hadn’t expected her Alzheimer’s to advance so rapidly.\nMASTER: Then we must finish the experiments as quickly as we can. With your continued help and support, I can perfect the process in the next few days.\nGOBERNAR: Really?\nMASTER: Would I lie? Your sister’s condition can be reversed. I’mclose now.

Well, if you think you can manage —\nHEATHER: Thank you. I’m famished.\nDOCTOR: Well, I’m glad to see it go to a good cause.\nHEATHER: (MOUTH FULL) Hey, isn’t that the chap who brought us over in the boat?\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry? — Ah, you mean, “Isn’t that the fellow who brought us in the boat?”\nHEATHER: (SWALLOWS) Yes. Over there, standing at the bar.\nDOCTOR: It is indeed.\nDOCTOR: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 64\nHEATHER: You never told me what you found out from him this afternoon.\nDOCTOR: Didn’t I?\nHEATHER: No.\nDOCTOR: Probably because it didn’t amount to much. And what he did say has rather been superseded by events.\nHEATHER: Oh?\nDOCTOR: He told me he brings more people over to the Dominus Institute than he ferries back again.\nHEATHER: Ah.\nDOCTOR: Exactly.\nHEATHER: And we know what happens to them now. Or at least, how they end up.\nDOCTOR: Exactly.\nDOCTOR: (FX: HEATHER FINISHES THE DOCTOR’S LEFT-OVERS AND PUTS DOWN HER CUTLERY. )\nHEATHER: I enjoyed that.\nDOCTOR: I’m pleased to hear it. Now all it needs is another glass of ginger beer to wash it down with.\nDOCTOR: (CONT’D) Can I get you anything from the bar?\nHEATHER: I’m fine thanks. Plenty left for now.\nDOCTOR: Well if you’re sure. I’1l ask them if they can clear away the plates at the same time.\nDOCTOR: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 65\nHEATHER: I expect they’1ll do that anyway.\nDOCTOR: You’re probably right. But I think while I’m there I’1l ask our friendly ferryman if he wants to join us.\nHEATHER: Because my conversation isn’t stimulating enough for you?\nDOCTOR: Because he might know something about that castle.\nHEATHER: You think it’s important?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know.

The castle?\nBOATMAN: Government, they say. But it’s been empty for years.\nDOCTOR: What would the government want with a place like that?\nBOATMAN: I don’t know what they used it for. Before I came here, to be honest. Maybe it was something to do with the naval base.\nDOCTOR: Ah yes, we read that the Dominus Institute was an old military facility.\nBOATMAN: Not much left of the original base. Dominus tore down most of it and rebuilt from scratch. Not short of money, that lot.\nHEATHER: Does anyone go there? To the castle?\nBOATMAN: No, it’s all fenced off. Not that they needed to bother.\nDOCTOR: Really - why’s that?\nBOATMAN: Locals won’t go up there anyway. They say it’s haunted.\nAMUSED: Haunted? You mean by ghosts?\nBOATMAN: Guess so.\nDOCTOR: And has anyone ever seen these ghosts? Or is it just rumour and gossip?\nBOATMAN: Oh no, there are people who claim to have seen lights up there at night.\nBOATMAN: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 68\nHEATHER: That’s not terribly spooky.\nBOATMAN: Figures, too. Some lads were up that way a couple of months ago. They’d had a few too many drinks in my opinion, so I'd take their story with more than a pinch of salt. But they reckoned they saw the walking dead.\nDOCTOR: The walking dead?\nBOATMAN: Their words, not mine.\nDOCTOR: Did they describe these ‘walking dead’?\nBOATMAN: Yes, but only like you’d expect. Pale, thin figures lurching about as if in a trance. You know the sort of thing.\nHEATHER: We certainly do.\nBOATMAN: Well, thanks for the drink, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: No — thank you, for such an enlightening conversation.\nBOATMAN: Best be going. Got an early start in the morning, so I don’t want a late night. (LEAVING) I’1l see you again, I’m sure.\nDOCTOR: I’m sure you will.\nHEATHER: So, what do you think?\nDOCTOR: I think that unlike our loquacious friend, we may well be having a late night.\nHEATHER: You want to go up to the castle and take a look, don’t you?\nDOCTOR: It would seem to be the logical next step, wouldn’t you agree?\nDOCTOR: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 69\nHEATHER: I would. But if we’re going looking for the walking dead in a haunted castle in the middle of the night...\nDOCTOR: Yes?\nHEATHER: I’1ll need another drink first.\nFADE OUT: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 70\nFADE OUT: (FADE IN:\nEFFORT: We’re lucky no one seems to maintain this fence... If I can just pull it free from the post... There, that’s done it.\nHEATHER: Well done, Doctor. Don’t worry about the bottom bit, we can climb over that.\nDOCTOR: You’re sure?\nHEATHER: Ask me in a minute.\nHEATHER: Yes, I’m sure.\nDOCTOR: We should probably fold it back into place. Makes it less obvious we’ve been here.\nHEATHER: Here, let me help.\nDOCTOR: That should do.\nHEATHER: So long as no one looks too closely.\nDOCTOR: I don’t think they get many visitors.\nHEATHER: Probably out of season. Come the summer, this place will be overrun with tourists and ice cream vans. There’s probably a little gift shop inside.\nDOCTOR: Well let’s go and see, shall we?\nDOCTOR: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 71\nDOCTOR: (FADE IN:\nDOCTOR: This looks like the way in.\nHEATHER: It’1ll be locked.\nDOCTOR: It’s locked.\nHEATHER: Maybe we can find a window to climb through?\nDOCTOR: Oh ye of little faith.\nHEATHER: What on earth is that?\nDOCTOR: Pick-lock.\nHEATHER: It’s ancient.\nDOCTOR: Ancient? It’s not ancient, it’s an antique. Belonged to Marie Antoinette, I’1ll have you know.\nHEATHER: Of course it did.\nDOCTOR: Since this is an old door, an old pick-lock should be just the thing...\nDOCTOR: There you go.\nHEATHER: Well done, Doctor.\nHEATHER: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL)\nDOCTOR: I said you should have more faith.\nHEATHER: I never doubted you for a moment.\nHEATHER: Page 72\nCUT TO: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 73\nDOCTOR: There’s no light.\nHEATHER: Hang on, I’11 use my phone. There’s a torch option on it somewhere, using the camera flash.\nDOCTOR: Good idea.\nHEATHER: There doesn’t seem to be a Signal anywhere on this island, so I’m glad it’s useful for something... There we are.\nDOCTOR: That’s better. Not that there’s a lot to see... Although, this corridor...\nHEATHER: What about it?\nDOCTOR: And that entrance...\nHEATHER: Did I miss something?\nDOCTOR: Oh no, no, no. It’s me that’s missing something. I’msure I recognise this place.\nHEATHER: Perhaps your mum brought you here for an ice cream when you were a kid?\nDOCTOR: I think that extremely unlikely.

Nor that anyone’s been here, even.\nDOCTOR: No. It’s all rather disappointing.\nHEATHER: Maybe we should head back to the Institute and think of something else.\nDOCTOR: Not just yet, if you don’t mind.\nHEATHER: I’ve got nothing better to do. Except possibly sleep.\nDOCTOR: We’re still on the ground floor. Maybe there’s something interesting upstairs.\nHEATHER: Not that we’ve seen any stairs.\nDOCTOR: Then that gives us something to look for.\nHEATHER: What was that?\nDOCTOR: I’m not sure. Could be someone moving around.\nHEATHER: Or it could be this place starting to fall down.\nDOCTOR: It came from below us.\nHEATHER: Dungeons? That’s all we need.\nDOCTOR: This place isn’t old enough for dungeons. What we actually need are stairs down to the cellars... And voila!\nDOCTOR: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 75\nHEATHER: So, we’re actually going down there, are we?\nDOCTOR: I am, now that I’ve found the stairs, yes. You can stay here if you’d rather. On your own. In the haunted castle.\nHEATHER: You make it sound so appealing. Oh all right then. But you can go first.\nDOCTOR: Agreed.

There’s a door up ahead. The corridor keeps going, so maybe it’s a store room of some sort.\nHEATHER: It doesn’t look like a store room. In fact... You know you said this place wasn’t old enough to have dungeons...\nDOCTOR: Yes, I see what you mean. Solid wooden door, with a metal grille set in it.\nHEATHER: There’s a light inside.\nDOCTOR: Then let’s take a look through the grille...\nDOCTOR: (CONT’D) How very odd.\nHEATHER: What can you see?\nDOCTOR: Take a look for yourself.\nHEATHER: Oh my... It is a dungeon.\nDOCTOR: So it would seem. And that poor woman is a prisoner.\nHEATHER: Chained to the wall. But why? We have to help her.\nDOCTOR: I couldn’t agree more.\nDOCTOR: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 77\nHEATHER: She doesn’t seem aware of us. Is she asleep? Or unconscious?\nDOCTOR: Let’s get in there and find out.\nHEATHER: She can’t have been here long. Her clothes look clean. In fact, she looks very ordinary.

Only when I got back to the pub, I heard I’d just missed a couple of strangers following in my footsteps.\nDOCTOR: We must have just missed each other.\nTHREADSTONE: Had to hire the Landrover from the landlady. She drove a hard bargain, but the walking was killing me.\nHEATHER: But I thought you were in California.\nTHREADSTONE: I was.\nDOCTOR: And I’m guessing you found that Arthur Makeling wasn’t.\nTHREADSTONE: There was no record of him. When I retraced his movements, it led here to the Dominus Institute.\nHEATHER: Why didn’t you tell me you were here?\nTHREADSTONE: I was worried you might follow me down here on some rash impulse. It seems I was right.\nTHREADSTONE: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 83\nDOCTOR: Did you find Makeling?\nTHREADSTONE: I did. Last night.\nHEATHER: At the Institute?\nTHREADSTONE: Sadly not. He was one of those mindless creatures that was coming after you. But what are you two doing here?\nDOCTOR: We'll explain on the way.\nTHREADSTONE: On the way where?\nDOCTOR: Back to the Dominus Institute.\nTHREADSTONE: Are you sure you want to go back there? I assume that’s where you came from?\nHEATHER: I got a grant for some research.\nDOCTOR: It seemed like the best way to get in. And yes, we do want to go back there.\nTHREADSTONE: All right. Let’s see if I can find the way back to the road.\nHEATHER: Dad.\nTHREADSTONE: Yes?\nHEATHER: It’s good to see you.\nTHREADSTONE: And you.\nHEATHER: And thanks for coming to get us from the castle.\nTHREADSTONE: That’s all right. You were lucky to get out. The place used to be a prison.\nTHREADSTONE: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 84\nDOCTOR: A prison?\nTHREADSTONE: So I’m told.\nREALISING: Of course! That’s why I thought I knew it.\nHEATHER: You mean you have been here before?\nDOCTOR: Indeed I have. After he was captured by UNIT at Devil’s End, this is one of the prisons where the Master was locked up.\nTHREADSTONE: The who?\nDOCTOR: A very nasty piece of work. I thought he must be behind this.\nHEATHER: But you said Gobernar wasn’t the Master.\nDOCTOR: He’s not. It’s our friend Damien Scott. I should have realised sooner.\nHEATHER: But why didn’t you recognise him?\nDOCTOR: Oh he’s very good at concealing himself. And he can change his appearance.\nTHREADSTONE: You mean like a disguise?\nDOCTOR: Sometimes a disguise, yes.\nTHREADSTONE: So what’s this Master up to?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know. And why has he come back here?\nFADE OUT: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 85\nFADE OUT: (FADE IN: THE LANDROVER PULLS UP. DOCTOR AND HEATHER GET OUT.)\nTHREADSTONE: Why don’t I take you all the way to the Institute?\nDOCTOR: Best if Heather and I walk from here, I think. The Master may have eyes on the main gate. I’d sooner have him believe we’re on our own out here, for now.\nHEATHER: So we’re not going to confront Damien? — The Master, I mean?\nDOCTOR: Far too dangerous. It would be useful to know a little more about what he’s up to.\nTHREADSTONE: Well, I don’t know about you but I’ve had enough excitement for one night. I’m not as young as I was.\nDOCTOR: Who is?\nHEATHER: Dad - you head back to the pub and get some rest? We’11 be fine here, won’t we, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: The Master doesn’t yet know that we know who he is. That simple fact should keep us safe, for now.\nHEATHER: (TO THREADSTONE) We’1ll come and find you in the morning, Dad. I promise.\nTHREADSTONE: Well... if you’re sure...\nDOCTOR: I’m sure. — Though I don’t suppose you’ve managed to get a phone Signal, have you, Professor?\nTHREADSTONE: There doesn’t seem to be a signal anywhere on the island.\nTHREADSTONE: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 86\nHEATHER: You want to call for help?\nDOCTOR: That’s right. With the Master at large and up to who knows what I don’t think we have much choice. I’m going to call UNIT.\nTHREADSTONE: You could come back to the pub and call from there.\nDOCTOR: No, I’d rather keep an eye on things here until UNIT arrive.\nHEATHER: Are you sure you’1ll be all right, Dad?\nTHREADSTONE: Don’t worry about me. You just look out for yourselves.\nDOCTOR: We’1ll see you soon.\nTHREADSTONE: You’d better.\nHEATHER: Bye, Dad.\nHEATHER: (FX: THREADSTONE GETS BACK INTO THE LANDROVER AND STARTS THE ENGINE. HE DRIVES OFF.)\nHEATHER: (CONT’D) Doctor — we can’t just ring for help from the lab. The phones could be bugged.\nDOCTOR: That had occurred to me.\nHEATHER: So...?\nDOCTOR: Come on.\nFADE OUT: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 87\nFADE OUT: (FADE IN:\nDOCTOR: No-one around.\nHEATHER: Isn’t it a bit dangerous, sneaking into the Master’s own office?\nDOCTOR: Oh he’ll be busy with some machinations. This will be the only telephone that we can guarantee won’t be under surveillance.\nHEATHER: We could have asked Gobernar.\nDOCTOR: He’s probably in league with the Master. Or under the Master’s influence. I daresay that’s how he controls the rest of this Institute staff, when they’re here.\nHEATHER: How?\nDOCTOR: By hypnotism. It’s a talent of his. So don’t look into his eyes.\nHEATHER: I'll bear that in mind, thanks.\nDOCTOR: Ah - there you are, you see. Telephone.\nDOCTOR: (FX: THE DOCTOR LIFTS THE HANDSET AND DIALS. WE HEAR THE TONE AS THE PHONE RINGS AT THE OTHER END. )\nDOCTOR: (CONT’D) It’s ringing.\nHEATHER: At least there’s an outside line.\nHEATHER: (FX: THE PHONE IS ANSWERED. THE ANSWERING VOICE IS ACTUALLY THE MASTER, BUT DISTORTED AND DISGUISED SO THAT WE - AND THE DOCTOR - DON’T REALISE. )\nDOCTOR: Hello? Hello, is that the UNIT hotline?\nMASTER: (D) You’re through to UNIT. Please give your pass code.\nMASTER: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 88\nDOCTOR: This is the Doctor.\nMASTER: (D) Doctor who?\nDOCTOR: What do you mean, Doctor who? It’s the Doctor. Code word, er... Buffalo. Does that help?\nMASTER: (D) Buffalo... Yes, that checks out. How can we help, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I’m calling from the Dominus Institute to warn you that the Master is up to his old tricks again. [I don’t know what he’s planning exactly, but...]\nMASTER: (FX: THE DOCTOR BREAKS OFF BECAUSE THE VOICE AT THE OTHER END OF THE PHONE IS LAUGHING. )\nDOCTOR: Look, this isn’t a joke.\nMASTER: (D) Oh yes it is, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: I can assure you it is not. The Master is here.\nMASTER: (D) Well of course he is. Whatever took you so long?\nDOCTOR: What? You mean, you knew?\nDOCTOR: (FX: AS THE MASTER ANSWERS, THE DOOR OPENS AND HE ENTERS THE ROOM - SO WE HEAR HIM SPEAKING INTO HIS HANDSET AS WELL. )\nMASTER: It would be rather surprising if I didn’t, wouldn’t it, Doctor?\nHEATHER: Doctor!\nDOCTOR: You! But...\nDOCTOR: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 89\nMASTER: But you called UNIT. Yes, I know. Every communication into and out of this facility is screened. Should anyone dial a number not approved by me... I receive an alert. Big Brother is watching you, Doctor.\nHEATHER: These people - what have you done to them?\nMASTER: All in good time. First of all, I’d like to make sure we can have a civilised conversation without you trying to escape... or anything equally tiresome. Restrain them.\nBLANKS: Restrain. Restrain. Restrain.\nDOCTOR: Do you mind?\nHEATHER: Get off me!\nMASTER: I wouldn’t struggle. Some of them don’t know their own strength, any more than they know their own minds.\nDOCTOR: So you’re just going to have them hold us here?\nMASTER: That would be such a waste of a valuable resource.\nDOCTOR: Thank you.\nMASTER: I meant them, not you, Doctor. Tie them to those chairs. Use the Spare network cables in that drawer.\nHEATHER: What are you going to do with us?\nHEATHER: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 90\nMASTER: Now that is an interesting question. Fortunately, I have an interesting answer. Once you’re sitting comfortably, I shall be happy to explain...\nCUT TO: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 91\nTHREADSTONE: Not far now. I’d forgotten how exhausting it can be spending time with the Doctor...\nTHREADSTONE: What the devil’s that?\nBLANK: (FX: THE LANDROVER’S BRAKES SCREECH AS THREADSTONE TRIES TO STOP.\nBLANK: THE LANDROVER IMPACTS ON THE BLANK, KNOCKING IT ASIDE, THEN CAREERS OFF THE ROAD INTO A DITCH.)\nCUT TO: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 92\nMASTER: Obviously, I do not intend to explain the whole of my scheme to you.\nDOCTOR: No? Going by past form.. you surprise me. You may have a new body, but you’ll never change. — Is that a new body you’re wearing, or\nDOCTOR: just an above-average disguise?\nMASTER: Trying to make me reveal more than is necessary, Doctor? You may have a new body, but you’1ll never change.\nDOCTOR: Touché.\nHEATHER: Please. “Master”. You can’t just keep us here against our will.\nMASTER: I can do whatever I like with you, Doctor Threadstone. With either of you, in fact.\nDOCTOR: Now we’re getting to it. Take us to that secret laboratory you keep in the basement, I presume? There to drain our intellects in their entirety?\nHEATHER: (TO MASTER) What good would that even do you?\nMASTER: The Doctor’s intellect will be particularly useful to me at the present time. My TARDIS has been proving... unreliable, of late. I’ve been harvesting scientific minds in the hope of repairing it.\nDOCTOR: Yes, but Earth minds! What use are they to you?\nMASTER: Why... no use whatsoever.\nDOCTOR: I don’t follow.\nMASTER: Don’t you, Doctor? Missing scientists. ‘Dominus’. ‘Gobernar’. This island prison. I could hardly have made my presence here any more obvious to you.\nMASTER: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 93\nHEATHER: (REALISATION) It was a trap.\nMASTER: Any of the Doctor’s many incarnations would have served my purpose. There’s always one not far from this time period. All I had to do was bide my time, and quietly pick off a few known associates of his known associates.\nDOCTOR: Arthur Makeling, for example.\nMASTER: I knew you, Doctor, the moment you blustered into the exhibition hall. I knew I had you.\nHEATHER: But you rejected his application to Dominus!\nDOCTOR: For the sake of verisimilitude, I presume. Drawing the net tighter stale\nMASTER: Not really. But it gave me pleasure to contemplate your outraged reaction. I could not resist.\nDOCTOR: I wasn’t outraged. I was merely piqued.\nHEATHER: Yeah, hopping piqued.\nMASTER: Then I am satisfied. I’m not too proud to admit, Doctor Threadstone, that the Doctor has come close to besting me on several occasions in the past.\nDOCTOR: ‘Close to’?!\nMASTER: Let’s not quibble.\nDOCTOR: You could have just asked for my help, fixing your TARDIS - rather than going to all this trouble.\nMASTER: It’s been no trouble, I assure you.\nHEATHER: No trouble? What you did to all those people was no trouble?\nHEATHER: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 94\nMASTER: What ‘people’?\nDOCTOR: She means the scientists you lured here.\nMASTER: Oh. Well, they’re not ‘people’, not any more. Mere leftovers, with blank spaces in their brains where their minds used to be. I thought at first I would have to dispose of them. But they’ve turned out to be useful.\nDOCTOR: They were even more useful when they were real people.\nMASTER: A matter of opinion. In this state they are superbly amenable to my hypnotic powers. As they have no thoughts of their own...\nDOCTOR: They’1l do whatever you tell them.\nMASTER: Exactly.\nHEATHER: You’re a monster. An inhuman monster.\nMASTER: I’m a Time Lord, of course I’m ‘inhuman’. But now I really must apologise.\nHEATHER: You’ve a lot to apologise for.\nDOCTOR: You don’t know the half of it, Heather. Not even the smallest fraction.\nMASTER: I meant I must apologise for leaving you.\nDOCTOR: Not staying to gloat some more?\nMASTER: Sadly not. There is much I have to do before I’mready for you, Doctor. But I’m sure you and the other doctor will be able to amuse yourselves until I get back. Even if you can’t actually move, at least you can talk.\nYAWNS: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 95\nYAWNS: Are you still here?\nMASTER: In fact, you have my sympathy, Doctor Threadstone. In my experience, stopping him from talking is the problem.\nHEATHER: I’d rather listen to him than you.\nMASTER: Well, there’s no accounting for taste.\nDOCTOR: Bye then.\nMASTER: Come with me.\nHEATHER: I thought he’d leave those things behind to watch us.\nDOCTOR: Perhaps he needs them for something else. Or perhaps he’s just arrogant enough to believe we can’t possibly escape.\nHEATHER: Can we escape?\nDOCTOR: No, actually, I don’t think we can. Sorry.\nCUT TO: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL)\nCUT TO: 52.\nCUT TO: Page 96\nMASTER: Thank you for your help, my friends. Now then, back to the laboratory\nMASTER: to set up the final tests...\nFADE OUT: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 97\nFADE OUT: (FADE IN:\nFADE OUT: WITHOUT SUCCESS. )\nHEATHER: These cables won’t budge. Are you having any luck?\nDOCTOR: Sadly not. The knots are too tight.\nHEATHER: Too late anyway. He’s coming back.\nDOCTOR: Just be ready to take any chance we get to escape.\nHEATHER: Right.\nGOBERNAR: What are you doing here?\nDOCTOR: Not an awful lot actually.\nGOBERNAR: I was looking for Damien.\nHEATHER: Sir Andrew - can you untie us? Please?\nGOBERNAR: But who tied you up?\nHEATHER: Damien, who do you think?!\nDOCTOR: Sir Andrew, listen to me — the man you know as ‘Damien Scott’ is someone else entirely. A criminal mastermind called the Master.\nGOBERNAR: The Master?\nHEATHER: Look, we can discuss it later. Just untie us.\nHEATHER: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 98\nGOBERNAR: Damien is the Master.\nDOCTOR: Yes, that’s right.\nGOBERNAR: He is the Master... And I must obey him.\nHEATHER: What?!\nDOCTOR: Oh no. He’s hypnotised. Of course, he’d have to be. The Master takes no chances.\nHEATHER: But - Sir Andrew, please. You have to help us!\nGOBERNAR: If Damien tied you up, I’m sure he had his reasons. We’re so close now, so very close.\nDOCTOR: Sir Andrew - listen to me. Damien - the Master - he’s controlling your mind.\nGOBERNAR: My mind? No, you’re wrong. It’s not about my mind. It’s my sister’s mind.\nHEATHER: Your sister’s?\nGOBERNAR: She’s getting worse. The dementia. Damien is going to help. He can get her mind, her memories - he can get them back.\nDOCTOR: I seriously doubt that. Look - you have to listen to me. The Master is controlling you, but you can break free of him.\nMONOTONE: Break free... I can break free.\nHEATHER: Of course you can. Just untie us, and we can help you.\nCONFUSED: Yes. No - I must obey the Master.\nCONFUSED: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 99\nHEATHER: Oh it’s no use.\nDOCTOR: We mustn’t give up yet. Without the Master’s constant attention, the human mind struggles to break free. Sir Andrew, listen to me very carefully.\nGOBERNAR: Listen. Yes?\nDOCTOR: The Master is controlling your mind. But we can help you. Look into my eyes. That’s it. Now concentrate. Think about what’s happening here. Shouldn’t you be in charge of Dominus, not Damien Scott?\nGOBERNAR: In charge... Yes.. I am in charge of Dominus.\nDOCTOR: That’s it. Remember how it was before you met Damien. Can’t you see how he’s controlling your mind?\nDOCTOR: (GOBERNAR LETS OUT A DEEP BREATH. THE MASTER’S CONTROL IS SUDDENLY BROKEN AND HE IS HIMSELF, THOUGH CONFUSED. )\nGOBERNAR: Doctor Smith? And Doctor Threadstone... Why are you here? Why are you tied up?\nDOCTOR: At last. Just untie us and we’1ll explain everything.\nGOBERNAR: Yes. Yes, of course.\nHEATHER: Oh no.\nGOBERNAR: Damien, thank goodness you’re here. Quick, help me untie them.\nMASTER: I’m afraid that won’t be possible.\nGOBERNAR: Why not? What are you talking about?\nMASTER: Though I do appreciate your efforts, Doctor, I am afraid they have been in vain.\nMASTER: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 100\nDOCTOR: You won’t win, you know.\nMASTER: Oh but I already have.\nGOBERNAR: What’s he talking about? Damien?\nMASTER: Sir Andrew, look at me. Do you know who I am?\nGOBERNAR: You are.. You are...\nGOBERNAR: TRANCE-LIKE\nGOBERNAR: You are the Master, and I must obey you.\nHEATHER: Well that could have gone better.\nCUT TO: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 101\nCUT TO: (FX: THREADSTONE IS EXAMINING THE LANDROVER. HE SLAMS THE BONNET SHUT. )\nTHREADSTONE: Looks like I’m walking the rest of the way.\nTHREADSTONE: I’msorry about that, oldman. But from what the Doctor said, I think you were dead long before you stumbled into the road and got hit by me. (A THOUGHT) Except... if there was one of you on the road... there might be others. I’d better head back to Dominus...\nCUT TO: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 102\nMASTER: Ah, my friends. I assume then that everything is prepared.\nGOBERNAR: Damien?\nMASTER: The Master - remember?\nGOBERNAR: The Master... No - you’re Damien Scott. What’s going on here?\nDOCTOR: That’s it, Sir Andrew - struggle against him. Remember your sister. The dementia. The reason you got mixed up in all this.\nGOBERNAR: Damien. Doctor Smith says you can’t help my sister. Have you been lying to me?\nMASTER: It is so very inconvenient when people exhibit self-will.\nGOBERNAR: What about my sister?\nMASTER: Your name, Sir Andrew, is the reason you got ‘mixed up’ in all this.\nGOBERNAR: My... name?\nDOCTOR: ‘Gobernar’. It means ‘Master’.\nMASTER: A wealthy businessman with a name like that? How could I possibly resist such a target?\nHEATHER: Now do you see, Sir Andrew?\nGOBERNAR: Damien — untie these people at once. If you won’t do it, then I will.\nMASTER: Such a shame... Kill him, my creatures.\nGOBERNAR: What?\nGOBERNAR: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 103\nHEATHER: You can’t!\nBLANK: Kell: Kalil Kills\nGOBERNAR: Please! You’re not serious. Damien...!\nDOCTOR: Stop this!\nGOBERNAR: (THROTTLED) Please...!\nDOCTOR: (CONT’D)\nANGRY: There was no need for that!\nMASTER: Like I said. So inconvenient.\nHEATHER: They killed him!\nMASTER: They are very obliging. And now I really am in charge of the Institute, which makes things a lot easier.\nHEATHER: A man just died!\nMASTER: Which does present me with one small problem, I admit. Although not an insurmountable one.\nDOCTOR: You always were quicker to kill than to think.\nMASTER: I need to conduct just one more experiment to make certain of a few things. And then I shall be ready to remove your memories, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: How very exciting. I can’t wait.\nMASTER: That experiment will of course result in the creation of another Blank.\nMASTER: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 104\nHEATHER: More killing?\nMASTER: Oh, it’s not death. Not technically.\nHEATHER: You can’t call it living!\nMASTER: You can judge for yourself soon, Doctor Threadstone. You see, I was going to use Sir Andrew for the experiment, but now that he is unavailable, I shall have to use you instead.\nHEATHER: What? No - you can’t!\nMASTER: Untie her and bring her to the lab.\nDOCTOR: No - leave her! You can’t do this. I’1l submit to your process, but just leave Heather alone.\nMASTER: Oh no, Doctor. I have to be sure the process will work. Now, bring her.\nHEATHER: Doctor?!\nHEATHER: (CONT’D) Doctor - do something. Help me!\nSHOUTING: AFTER THEM Don’t worry, Heather! I will! Somehow!\nAMUSED: You really won’t, you know. But don’t you worry, Doctor - it will be your turn soon enough.\nAMUSED: (FX: THE MASTER FOLLOWS THE BLANKS AND HEATHER OUT OF THE ROOM.

We need to think of something to distract those creatures while the Master’s busy at the other end of the lab.\nTHREADSTONE: Like what?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know. — You said you were carrying a primitive smartphone?\nTHREADSTONE: The man in the shop said it was top of the range.\nDOCTOR: Show me.\nTHREADSTONE: All right. But I told you, I can’t get a signal.\nDOCTOR: I’m not trying to make a call. The main power feed to the lab looks to be an adaptation of contemporary technology. If that’s so... it ought to be Bluetooth compatible.\nTHREADSTONE: So...?\nTHREADSTONE: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 109\nDOCTOR: So.. if I’m terribly clever, I might be able to turn off the lights remotely. Or set off an alarm. Something.\nTHREADSTONE: And when you’ve done that, we rush in and grab Heather?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Only we don’t exit the way we came. There’s a tunnel leading from the back of the lab. That doorway, see?\nTHREADSTONE: Got it. — Hurry it up, then!\nDOCTOR: I’m trying. My fingers are still numb.\nTHREADSTONE: You’re trying to turn the lights off?\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nTHREADSTONE: Wouldn’t it be simpler to use the light switch?\nDOCTOR: No, because...

I’d like to go back to the castle.\nHEATHER: Why, what’s up there?\nDOCTOR: The laboratory we just escaped from contained highly advanced equipment that, if properly calibrated, could implant memories, experience, intellect into the mind.\nHEATHER: Yes, that’s what the Master said he was up to.\nDOCTOR: Except... I didn’t see anything there that could remove those memories, etcetera. How was he intending to do that, is the question that leaps to the forefront of my brain.\nTHREADSTONE: You think he might have another laboratory up at the castle?\nDOCTOR: It’s possible.\nHEATHER: What about that poor woman we saw? The one chained up in the cellars?\nDOCTOR: Yes, she may well be able to help us. Certainly, we ought to help her.\nFADE OUT: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 114\nFADE OUT: (FADE IN: THE DOCTOR, HEATHER AND THREADSTONE TALKING AS THEY WALK: )\nHEATHER: There don’t seem to be any of the blank creatures here.\nTHREADSTONE: The Master’s probably got them all at the Institute.\nDOCTOR: That seems likely. But let’s keep our wits about us anyway.\nTHREADSTONE: So who is this lady the Master’s keeping prisoner?\nDOCTOR: An excellent question. And one to which I hope we shall soon have an answer. The steps are just along here.\nFADE OUT: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 115\nFADE OUT: (FADE IN:\nDOCTOR: Here we are.\nTHREADSTONE: Locked. Can we break it down?\nDOCTOR: No need.\nDOCTOR: (FX: THE DOCTOR PRODUCES HIS PICK-LOCK FROM A POCKET AND SETS TO WORK ON THE LOCK. )\nHEATHER: The Doctor’s got a thingummy. Marie Antoinette’s.\nTHREADSTONE: Ah. Very handy.\nDOCTOR: Et voila.\nCUT TO: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 116\nLEACH: Who - who are you?\nDOCTOR: I’m the Doctor, these are Professor and Doctor Threadstone.\nHEATHER: Don’t worry, we’re here to help.\nDOCTOR: Let’s start by getting you out of these chains.\nLEACH: Thank you.\nDOCTOR: Why is the Master keeping you here, do you know?\nLEACH: You know the Master?\nTHREADSTONE: Unfortunately.\nDOCTOR: There you go.\nLEACH: Then I assume you know the Master was himself once a prisoner here.\nTHREADSTONE: So we gathered.\nDOCTOR: But why is this place so important to him? Why has he come back?\nLEACH: When he was held here, all those decades ago, the Master used stolen time Lord technology to set a trap.\nHEATHER: What sort of trap?\nLEACH: A trap for a very particular kind of creature. It took years for the trap to work. And by the time it did...\nLEACH: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 117\nDOCTOR: The Master was long gone.\nLEACH: That’s right. But once it had been drawn here, the creature found itself stuck — held captive ina stasis field, still active despite the Master’s absence.\nTHREADSTONE: And now he’s come back for this creature?\nDOCTOR: Yes, it’s all becoming clear.\nHEATHER: Come on, we should get moving before the Master guesses where we are.\nLEACH: Of course. Lead the way.\nCUT TO: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 118\nHEATHER: What sort of creature was it the Master trapped here?\nLEACH: A mind leach.\nTHREADSTONE: A what?\nDOCTOR: Of course. A creature that feeds on memories and experiences.\nLEACH: It extracts them from the minds of others to sustain itself.\nHEATHER: So that’s why there was no equipment for removing memories at the lab.\nDOCTOR: Exactly. The Master used the leach to remove the scientists’ memories and experiences. To create the blanks.\nTHREADSTONE: And he plans to use it to steal your mind too, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Once he can channel the memories from the mind leach into himself. That’s what the equipment in the lab is for. That’s why he needed to experiment on Heather - to make sure that process would work.\nTHREADSTONE: Then we have to find this creature. But where is it?\nLEACH: I’d have thought that was obvious.\nREALISING: Oh no. I think we may have made a rather silly mistake.\nLEACH: You have... Doctors. Professor.\nHEATHER: You mean...?\nHEATHER: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 119\nLEACH: (BECOMING PROGRESSIVELY MORE MONSTROUS) I am the mind leach. And after being alone in that cell for so long with no access to fresh minds, I am hungry.\nLEACH: So very... very.. hungry!\nLEACH: END OF PART THREE\nLEACH: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 120"

My two friends’ minds are not for your consumption!\nLEACH: You, “Doctor”. Your mind is barred to me...\nDOCTOR: Off the menu, I’m afraid. I’m a Time Lord, like the Master. I can resist you, for a time.\nLEACH: You are also a Time Lord?!\nLEACH: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 121\nDOCTOR: Heather, Professor — get away from here. Head back to the castle entrance, I’ll try to meet you there.\nHEATHER: But will you be [all right?]\nDOCTOR: Don’t argue, just run!!!\nDOCTOR: (FX: HEATHER AND THREADSTONE RUN.

If he’s not found us by then, we’1l1 head to the pub.\nHEATHER: And then what?\nTHREADSTONE: Call UNIT.\nFADE OUT: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 123\nFADE OUT: (FADE IN:\nDOCTOR: The question is, what to do with you, eh?\nLEACH: Do with me?\nDOCTOR: I think you’re as much a victim in this as those poor people whose minds you’ve ripped away.\nLEACH: I have to feed.\nDOCTOR: Which is why I can’t let you out of this castle.\nDOCTOR: (CONT’D)\nLOW: You hear that? We’ve got company.\nLEACH: We must leave. Escape.\nDOCTOR: Too late for that!\nDOCTOR: (CONT’D) And I’m guessing that as you’ve already fed on these people, they have no minds to eat, so you can’t stop them.\nLEACH: Don’t let them take me back to the cell, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: I don’t think they’re likely to listen to my advice. The Master can’t be far behind. I’m going to hide in this alcove, Leach, and I’m going to trust you not to give me away.\nLEACH: Why should I not?\nDOCTOR: Because I’m the best chance you’1ll ever have of escaping him.\nDOCTOR: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 124\nLEACH: Very well.\nDOCTOR: I’11 do what I can for you.\nDOCTOR: (FX: THE DOCTOR PUSHES THROUGH THE BLANKS AND DUCKS INTO AN ALCOVE AS THE MASTER APPROACHES. )\nAPPROACHING FROM OFF: Ah - my little vampire of the mind.

And anyway, I have a plan.\nHEATHER: What do we do?\nDOCTOR: You two head back to the Dominus Institute. I don’t know whether the Master’s managed to free the Blank jam in the tunnel, so you’d better take the long way.\nTHREADSTONE: And what about you?\nDOCTOR: I’m going to sneak back down to the cellars and have a quiet word with our mind leach friend.\nHEATHER: You’re mad!\nDOCTOR: Very probably, but only north north west. Now, while I dothat, here’s what I want you two to do when you get back to Dominus...\nDOCTOR: FADE OUT.\nDOCTOR: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 126\nDOCTOR: (FADE IN:\nDOCTOR: THEY SPEAK IN LOW VOICES. )\nHEATHER: There are a few blanks over that way, Dad. Look, you can see them through the trees.\nTHREADSTONE: Then they’re right between us and the hole in the fence where I drove through.\nHEATHER: That doesn’t matter. If we go that way, we’1l1 find the hole the Doctor and I made when we got in.\nTHREADSTONE: All right. Then we’1ll have to circle round to get back to the road to the Institute.\nHEATHER: Well, at least it’s not raining.\nTHREADSTONE: You understand what the Doctor wants us to do?\nHEATHER: I think so.

You will help me escape from the Master’s control?\nDOCTOR: If I can. But I need your help too. Will you do what I have asked?\nLEACH: Of course. I have done terrible things to the people here...\nDOCTOR: (DISTASTE) I know.\nLEACH: But I had no choice. And, at first, I did not know what I was doing.\nDOCTOR: I know that, too. You’re from Carmentia, aren’t you?\nSURPRISED: You know of my world?\nDOCTOR: I do. And I know that you’re just trying to survive. The population of Carmentia are all telepathic, so everyone’s thoughts and memories are there for the taking.\nLEACH: I assumed the people here were the same. They look like the people on my world. Feeding on the thoughts, on the minds of my own people does no harm. It keeps our consciousness sustained as much as food and drink keeps our bodies alive.\nDOCTOR: I know. But I’m afraid here it’s rather different.\nLEACH: As I discovered. But without... suitable minds to feed on, I should have died.\nDOCTOR: The reason why the Master targeted superior minds. To keep you fed.\nLEACH: Perhaps it would have been better to have starved me.\nLOW: Someone’s coming.\nLOW: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 130\nLOW: You must go.\nLOW: Too late, I’m afraid.\nSURPRISED: Doctor!\nDOCTOR: It’s all right, I was just leaving.\nAMUSED: I’m sorry, Doctor, but there is no way out.\nCUT TO: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 131\nCUT TO: (FX: THE DOCTOR RUNS OUT OF THE CELL - STRAIGHT INTO A GROUP OF BLANKS, GRUNTING AND MOANING AS USUAL. )\nDOCTOR: Not you lot again!\nMASTER: Hold him.\nBLANK: Hold... Hold... Hold...\nDOCTOR: Get off me!\nDOCTOR: (FX: BUT HE CAN’T BREAK FREE. WITH A SIGH, THE DOCTOR STOPS STRUGGLING. )\nMASTER: I don’t know where your friends have got to, Doctor. But it’s you I really need, so we can ignore them for now.\nDOCTOR: So what happens now? More boring gloating and self-aggrandisement?\nMASTER: Sadly we don’t have the time. Together with your new friend, we’re all going back to the Institute.\nDOCTOR: To your hidden laboratory.\nMASTER: Exactly. Bring the prisoner too.\nFADE OUT: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 132\nFADE OUT: (FADE IN:\nFADE OUT: CORRIDOR. THE MASTER IS WITH THEM. )\nDOCTOR: You realise, of course, that by now Professor Threadstone and his daughter will have got a boat back to the mainland and contacted UNIT.\nMASTER: The thought had occurred to me.\nLEACH: Who is this UNIT?\nDOCTOR: A military and intelligence organisation that is supremely qualified to deal with people like the Master.\nMASTER: It will take UNIT a while to mobilise and to get here.\nDOCTOR: I’m quite happy to wait.\nMASTER: But I am not. So sadly we shall have to dispense with the final test I had planned, and proceed straight to the end game.\nDOCTOR: My mind?\nMASTER: If I were you, Doctor, right now I’d be thinking of all the happy times.

So our mutual friend can feed.\nWHISPERS: See that door, Dad?\nWHISPERS: Yes.\nWHISPERS: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 134\nWHISPERS: That’s the other room. We need to get in there to complete the connections.\nWHISPERS: Hands and knees, then. Under the benches. Come on.\nWHISPERS: (FX: HEATHER AND THREADSTONE MAKE THEIR WAY CAUTIOUSLY ACROSS AND OUT OF THE ROOM.\nAS THEY DO: )\nLEACH: You wish me to drain this man’s mind?\nMASTER: I do. But once we are all connected into the systems.\nDOCTOR: All connected? You’re joining us then?\nMASTER: When our friend here drains your mind, Doctor, the contents - the memories and experience - will not flow into her mind, but mine.\nLEACH: But I must feed soon.\nMASTER: Once you have taken the Doctor’s mind, you can feed on as many of the primitive inhabitants of this backward planet as you wish. Any final questions, Doctor, before we complete the last connection?\nDOCTOR: Two, actually.\nMASTER: (GRITTED TEETH) If I must.\nDOCTOR: When your mind is linked into the equipment, what will happen to these blanks of yours?\nMASTER: Without my mind actively controlling them, they will become directionless, dormant.\nDOCTOR: I see.\nMASTER: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 135\nMASTER: But only until the process is complete and I am automatically disconnected from the equipment. There won’t be any chance for you to escape, if that’s what you’re thinking.\nDOCTOR: I wouldn’t dream of it.\nMASTER: Well, I shall know soon enough what you dream of, shan’t I, Doctor? Now — you are both fully connected. So it just remains for me to attach myself to the equipment.\nDOCTOR: Wait! I had two questions, remember?\nMASTER: (SIGH) Yes?\nDOCTOR: Why do you need my mind to repair your TARDIS, exactly? Your knowledge of temporal mechanics is almost as good as mine.\nMASTER: It.. was. But my memory has become... unreliable, lately.\nDOCTOR: Unreliable?\nMASTER: There are certain... gaps in my mind. Gaps in my knowledge.\nDOCTOR: That’s old age for you. It comes to us all, old friend. To me, even. I can’t think why I didn’t recognise this island right away.\nMASTER: I am not... senile, Doctor! No. Something happened to me. A short while ago. Something painful.\nMASTER: SCENE 47 [PAGE 94]:\nMASTER: ([SEBASTIAN] SLAMS A LEVER DOWN. BIG BURST OF ENERGY, BUZZING.

(RETURNING; LOW VOICES, BUT NOT WHISPERS) How are you doing with those remote links?\nHEATHER: This is the last one. If the Doctor’s right, it will bypass the main equipment and broadcast on the same mental frequency as the Master’s hypnotic control.\nTHREADSTONE: We’ll soon find out, it looks like he’s connected.\nHEATHER: Then the process will start automatically.\nCUT TO: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 138\nCUT TO: (FX: A RISING HUM OF POWER AS THE EQUIPMENT GETS GOING AND THE PROCESS STARTS. )\nMASTER: Not long now, Doctor. Not long now until your mind is mine!\nEFFORT: That’s what you think. Remember our agreement.\nMASTER: Agreement? What agreement?\nDOCTOR: I wasn’t talking to you.\nMASTER: What?\nLEACH: Yes, Doctor. I remember.\nMASTER: No - no, what are you doing?\nLEACH: I am doing what I agreed with the Doctor - just taking a tiny portion of his mind.\nDOCTOR: My short term memories. Enough to sustain you, but not so much it will harm me.\nMASTER: No - stop! I must have his mind. All of it.\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid not. A portion of my short term memories is going to the mind leach. But if Heather and her father have done their work, then most is being broadcast on the same mental frequency as you use to control the blanks.\nMASTER: Stop them! This isn’t right. You - stop the process and release me from this equipment.\nBLANK: Wait, watch, and learn.\nMASTER: What?\nMASTER: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 139\nANOTHER: BLANK When I say run, run.\nMASTER: No - listen to me. I am the Master and you will obey me. You must obey me.\nBLANK: [MAKELING] I must...

I am your Master!\nHEATHER: Sounds like it’s working.\nTHREADSTONE: Yes - yes, I think it is.\nHEATHER: Then let’s get back in there and help the Doctor.\nCUT TO: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 141\nCUT TO: (FX: HEATHER AND THREADSTONE ENTER AND HURRY TO THE DOCTOR. THE BLANKS MOAN AND GRUNT QUIETLY THROUGHOUT. )\nHEATHER: Doctor - are you all right?\nMASTER: You will pay for your meddling!\nDOCTOR: Oh do be quiet. Yes, thank you, Heather, I’m fine. If you could just disconnect me.\nTHREADSTONE: But what happened to Makeling and these others?\nDOCTOR: A little dose of my short-term memory. They were empty vessels before, now they have the vaguest inkling that they are me.\nHEATHER: So they won’t obey the Master.\nDOCTOR: Obviously not.\nDOCTOR: (CONT’D) Ah, that’s better, thank you. I honestly cannot say that was a pleasure.\nMASTER: Release me, Doctor. Release me and we can come to an agreement, I’m sure.\nLEACH: You are already part of an agreement.\nMASTER: What? What agreement?\nDOCTOR: Oh yes. I did sort of promise our friend here that if she didn’t take my mind...\nMASTER: Yes?\nMASTER: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 142\nDOCTOR: She could have yours.\nMASTER: You can’t do this!\nDOCTOR: Of course I can. It’s simplicity itself. While you’re hooked up to that, I just reset this...\nDOCTOR: (FX: THE DOCTOR THROWS A SWITCH. THE POWER HUM DROPS, THEN RISES AGAIN. )\nDOCTOR: (CONT’D) And Bob’s your uncle. Well, he’s not, but you know what I mean.\nTHREADSTONE: So, that’s it?\nDOCTOR: Not quite. Let’s get the mind leach disconnected.\nLEACH: Thank you.\nDOCTOR: You can take the Master’s mind from the main storage bank once it’s been drained. Give me a hand, will you, Heather?\nHEATHER: Of course, Doctor.\nHEATHER: (FX: HEATHER AND THE DOCTOR START TO DISCONNECT THE LEACH.\nHEATHER: AS THEY WORK, THREADSTONE GOES OVER TO WHERE THE MASTER IS ATTACHED TO THE EQUIPMENT.\nHEATHER: THE MASTER IS WEAKENING AS HIS MIND STARTS TO DRAIN.)\nTHREADSTONE: I’1l never understand a monster like you.\nMASTER: I’ll take that as a compliment.\nTHREADSTONE: To do this to people - drain their minds and leave them empty. Dead. Or as good as dead.\nMASTER: As you said, you’1ll never understand.\nMASTER: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 143\nTHREADSTONE: Arthur Makeling was a friend of mine. Now look at him, shambling about aimlessly. Like an empty shell. I guess now you’1l find out what it’s like.\nMASTER: You want to know why I did it?\nTHREADSTONE: Can there be a good reason?\nMASTER: Of course. Come closer and I’11 tell you. That’s it. The reason is, because I am the Master. Now - look into my eyes.\nFLAT: Look into your eyes.\nMASTER: I am the Master.\nFLAT: The Master.\nTHREADSTONE: (CONT’D) I am the Master, and you will obey me.\nTHREADSTONE: (CONT’D)\nFLAT: Yes, Master.\nMASTER: Now, release me from this equipment.\nFLAT: Yes Master.\nFLAT: (FX: THREADSTONE STARTS TO DISCONNECT THE MASTER.\nFLAT: ACROSS THE LAB, THE DOCTOR AND HEATHER FINISH DISCONNECTING THE MIND LEACH. )\nHEATHER: That’s the last connector.\nDOCTOR: There you go.\nLEACH: Thank you, Doctor.\nLEACH: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 144\nDOCTOR: All part of the service, now to deal with -\nDOCTOR: (CONT’D)\nSHOUTING: Professor — no!\nSHOUTING: Dad, what are you doing?\nFLAT: I must obey.\nMASTER: Thank you for releasing me, Professor. — You really thought you could outwit me, Doctor?\nHEATHER: We have to stop him.\nLEACH: The blanked humans, Doctor. They will obey you now your mind is in them.\nDOCTOR: Of course.\nCALLING: Blanks - everyone - stop the Master.\nMASTER: Do you think I wouldn’t have a contingency plan in case my creatures became uncontrollable?\nHEATHER: What’s he doing?\nDOCTOR: He must be channelling another order to them directly through the equipment.\nMASTER: My dull Blank friends. You’ve outlived your usefulness. Now die!!!\nBLANKS: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 145\nLEACH: A kill order. He has destroyed their minds utterly.\nHEATHER: We have to do something!\nDOCTOR: Indeed we do!\nLEACH: I shall stop him.\nDOCTOR: No - wait!\nDOCTOR: (FX: BUT THE MIND LEACH RUNS ACROSS AND GRAPPLES WITH THE MASTER.\nOVER THIS: )\nDOCTOR: (CONT’D) See to your father, Heather. I’1l1 help the mind leach.\nEFFORT: You will die for what you have done to me. For what you have made me do to others.\nEFFORT: I don’t think so. You do realise that there’s an exposed power tranducoid on the main power relay distributor just behind you, don’t you?\nLEACH: What?\nMASTER: Why don’t you take a closer look?!\nMASTER: (FX: THE MASTER HURLS THE MIND LEACH AWAY.\nMASTER: THE MIND LEACH CRIES OUT, AND CRASHES INTO A BANK OF EQUIPMENT. THERE IS AN EXPLOSION, SPARKS ETC.\nDOCTOR: (RUSHING OVER) No!\nHEATHER: Don’t touch her, Doctor. She’s electrified.\nHEATHER: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 146\nMASTER: I did warn her.\nDOCTOR: Heather — power down that thing.\nHEATHER: It’s no use, Doctor.\nHEATHER: The Master! He’s getting away!\nDOCTOR: He’s heading for the tunnel. The Blanks there will be dead now.\nCUT TO: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 147\nTO HIMSELF: You may have got the better of me this time, Doctor. But we’1l meet again, that much is inevitable! And then...\nFADE OUT: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 148\nFADE OUT: (FADE IN:\nHIT: IT.)\nANXIOUS: Is Dad... like the others were?\nDOCTOR: What? Oh no, no, no. The Master hypnotised him, that’s all. He didn’t have time to do a very thorough job. Now the Master’s gone, I imagine his control will lapse and -\nDOCTOR: (FX: THE DOCTOR BREAKS OFF AS THREADSTONE SUDDENLY BECOMES HIMSELF\nAGAIN: - LIKE JOLTING AWAKE. )\nTHREADSTONE: Woah! What’s going on?\nHEATHER: Dad - you’re all right!\nTHREADSTONE: Yes, well, I think so. But what’s happened? Where’s the Master?\nHEATHER: You don’t remember?\nDOCTOR: The Master’s gone. That’s all you need to know.\nTHREADSTONE: And the mind leach thing?\nDOCTOR: The Master shoved her into the main power relay distributor. Caused quite a bit of damage. I’m afraid she’s - (dead)\nDOCTOR: (FX: THE DOCTOR IS INTERRUPTED BY ANOTHER EXPLOSION FROM THE EQUIPMENT. )\nDOCTOR: (CONT’D) I don’t like the look of that.\nHEATHER: The whole system’s on fire.\nTHREADSTONE: But if that’s the power distributor...\nTHREADSTONE: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 149\nDOCTOR: Yes, exactly. I think we should get out of here before the whole place goes up!\nFADE OUT: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 150\nFADE OUT: (FADE IN: THE DOCTOR, HEATHER AND THREADSTONE HURRYING ALONG. )\nDOCTOR: Which is the way out?\nTHREADSTONE: Don’t you remember?\nDOCTOR: Things do seem a little bit hazy.\nHEATHER: It’s this way.\nDOCTOR: Thank you, um.. Sorry, what was your name again?\nHEATHER: Heather.\nDOCTOR: Yes of course. I knew that.\nTHREADSTONE: Are you all right, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Of course I am. Fit as ninepence. Right as a fiddle. I just seem to be having trouble remembering the last few days.\nHEATHER: Your short term memory!\nDOCTOR: What about it?\nTHREADSTONE: You let the mind leach take it.\nDOCTOR: What mind leach?\nREMEMBERING: Oh yes, the mind leach!\nHEATHER: The one the Master brought here.\nDOCTOR: The Master? He was here? No wait, of course he was.\nDOCTOR: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 151\nTHREADSTONE: So you do remember him.\nDOCTOR: Dressed in black, with a rather sinister dark beard?\nTHREADSTONE: Um, no, actually.\nDOCTOR: Then there’s obviously a lot I don’t remember. Like what regeneration he was in, or even what he looked like.\nHEATHER: Nearly there. The main exit is just ahead.\nFADE OUT: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 152\nFADE OUT: (FADE IN:\nFADE OUT: THE DOCTOR, HEATHER AND THREADSTONE RUN FROM THE INSTITUTE, BREATHLESS. )\nHEATHER: Are we far enough away yet, do you think?\nDOCTOR: Oh I should think so.\nTHREADSTONE: Thank goodness. I don’t think I could run another step.\nTHREADSTONE: (FX: HE COLLAPSES TO THE GROUND, EXHAUSTED. HEATHER AND THE DOCTOR\nSIT: DOWN BESIDE HIM. )\nDOCTOR: Not much fun is it, getting old?\nTHREADSTONE: Better than the alternative, I suppose.\nHEATHER: The memory goes, apparently.\nDOCTOR: Mmmm.\nDOCTOR: (FX: IN THE DISTANCE, THE DOMINUS INSTITUTE EXPLODES. IT CONTINUES\nTO BURN AS THEY SPEAK: )\nTHREADSTONE: I hope there was no one else in there.\nDOCTOR: Oh, the Master made sure we were the only people here. He didn’t want anyone else getting in the way.\nHEATHER: You remember that, then?\nDOCTOR: The memory loss is a bit selective. Thankfully, there’s nothing missing that’s too important. Well, not as far as I can remember.\nTHREADSTONE: And what about the Master?\nDOCTOR: Gone, I expect.\nDOCTOR: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 153\nTHREADSTONE: How?\nDOCTOR: You didn’t happen to see an iron maiden anywhere in the Institute? Or a horse box? Or a grandfather clock?\nHEATHER: Erv...\nDOCTOR: Never mind. Suffice it to say, I think it’s more than likely that he’s far away fromhere by now. Very far away, now I’ve put the mockers on his latest scheme, which was... (VAGUE) was...?\nHEATHER: (PROMPT) Something to do with fixing his TARDIS, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Yes, using my memories to plug the gaps in his own. I wonder what caused them? Was it post-regenerative trauma, or was it.. (TRAILS\nOFF: )\nHEATHER: Was it what?\nDOCTOR: Was what what?\nHEATHER: Whatever it was you said. Post-regenerative trauma?\nDOCTOR: Post-regenerative trauma, you say? Perhaps. I’1l have to remember to ask him, next time we meet.\nHEATHER: If you remember to ask him.\nDOCTOR: Yes. — Ask him what?\nTHREADSTONE: So, what happens now?\nDOCTOR: The sun’s coming up. I think it’s going to be a lovely day.\nHEATHER: Well, picturesque though it is, I’d rather like to get off this island and back home.\nHEATHER: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 154\nTHREADSTONE: I couldn’t agree more. Though we should stop by the pub so I can tell the landlady which ditch her Landrover needs towing out of. But then, home. All right with you, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Yes, I expect you’re right. Still it’s a nice morning for a brisk\nDOCTOR: walk down to the harbour, and with a bit of luck our friendly boatman will be there.\nFADE OUT: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 155\nFADE OUT: (FADE IN:\nDOCTOR: Thank you.\nHEATHER: Sorry to bring you out so early.\nBOATMAN: Oh that’s no problem.\nTHREADSTONE: What do we owe you?\nBOATMAN: That’s all right. Dominus pay me a retainer. Or they used to. Not quite sure what’1ll happen now after that fire.\nDOCTOR: I’m sure there will still be people wanting to see the island.\nBOATMAN: I’m sure there will.\nHEATHER: You heading back?\nBOATMAN: No, it’s a nice day. I think I’1l go for a walk along the beach.\nTHREADSTONE: Well, thank you again.\nBOATMAN: No problem. You can get a taxi just over there. And the station’s only... Well, I’m sure you remember.\nHEATHER: I’m sure some of us do.\nDOCTOR: Yes, thank you for that. Enjoy your walk.\nBOATMAN: Have a safe journey home.\nTHREADSTONE: Thank you.\nTHREADSTONE: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 156\nHEATHER: Bye then.\nHEATHER: (FX: THE DOCTOR, HEATHER, AND THREADSTONE WALK OFF TO FIND A TAXI,\nFADE THEM AS THEY GO: )\nDOCTOR: I hope the train will have one of those little trolleys that sells biscuits and crisps. And hot liquid that tastes completely unlike tea or coffee...\nFADE OUT: #212: VAMPIRE OF THE MIND by Justin Richards (FINAL) Page 157\nFADE OUT: (FADE IN:\nFADE OUT: THE BOATMAN WALKING ALONG THE BEACH, HIS FEET ON SHINGLE. HE OPERATES A COMMUNICATIONS DEVICE - FUTURISTIC BLEEPS.\nHIS: VOICE IS FLAT AND TONELESS - HYPNOTISED: )\nBOATMAN: Hello, can you hear me?\nBOATMAN: (FX: NOTE THAT WE DO NOT HEAR WHOEVER HE IS SPEAKING TO. LEAVE A PAUSE AT EACH ELLIPSIS FOR THEM TO SPEAK TO THE BOATMAN. )\nBOATMAN: (CONT'D)\nBOATMAN: The Doctor and his friends have left the island now. The Master escaped in his TARDIS. [..] Yes, I was able to access the Institute, as you instructed. While the Doctor kept him occupied. [..] Yes, I identified his TARDIS. An obsolete computer bank. It was damaged. [..] Yes, the tracking device is now in place. [... LONGISH BEAT...] I understand. Now my work is done, I must walk into the sea.\nBOATMAN: (FX: THE BOATMAN CLICKS OFF THE COMMUNICATIONS DEVICE, THEN WALKS INTO THE SEA.\nBOATMAN: THE WAVES GET LOUDER AND HE WADES INTO THEM, AND KEEPS GOING. ALL\nTHE TIME SAYING OVER AND OVER: )\nBOATMAN: (CONT’D) I must obey... I must obey... I must obey...\nBOATMAN: (FX: FINALLY, THE WATER CLOSES OVER HIS HEAD. HE GASPS AND SPLUTTERS, AND THEN ALL WE HEAR IS THE MUFFLED UNDERWATER SOUND OF A FEW BUBBLE RISING...)\nBOATMAN: -- THE END --"
