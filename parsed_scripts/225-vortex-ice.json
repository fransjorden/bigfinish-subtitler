This tunnel is the only way in — or out.\nDYLAN: (FROM UP AHEAD) Choke up ahead for five, ten metres.\nSAT: After that?\nDYLAN: (STRETCHES TO LOOK) Can’t see. Gonna be a tight squeeze.\nSAI: Map? Jannik?\nJANNIK: Hold on. (FX: USES ELECTRONIC GADGET LIKE AN IPAD, IT CREATES A\nHOLOGRAM: MAP) If we are where I think we are —\nHOLLY: (SARCASTIC LAUGH) If!\nJANNIK: - we’re approaching the northern shaft. If it’s clear, that should give us access to the lower levels.\nSAI: How sure are you?\nJANNIK: As sure as I can be, given that the compass is playing silly- beggars.\nJANNIK: #225a: VORTEX ICE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 3\nHOLLY: A bad workman (always) —\nJANNIK: It’s not my fault. (FX: GADGET MAKES PHHHT! NOISE, SO HE BANGS IT. IT DEACTIVATES.) There must be magnetic interference.\nSAI: Just not keen on us getting caught in another dead-end.\nHOLLY: (MUTTERS) If you’d listened to me...\nDYLAN: Look, shall I just go on ahead?\nSAI: Not without my say-so. Alright, Holly, you clearly have something to say, so let’s hear it.\nHOLLY: Just that the ion emission count has been increasing for the last half hour. We’re getting warmer.\nJANNIK: (SARCASTIC) Well, we are two hundred metres below sea level.\nSAI: You mean we’re heading the right way?\nHOLLY: I mean, whatever we’re looking for is somewhere on the other Side of those rocks.\nSAI: Assuming there’s a way through.\nJANNIK: If there isn’t, that’s it, we’ll have to turn back.\nSAI: We haven’t come this far to turn back. Okay. Dylan, on you go.\nDYLAN: Right. (SQUEEZES THROUGH ROCKS)\nSAI: Carefully. I want to be able to see you every step of the way.\nSAI: #225a: VORTEX ICE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 4\nDYLAN: (MUTTERS TO HIMSELF) I’m always careful.\nDYLAN: SAI, HOLLY, JANNIK: (REACT, HOLDING BREATH)\nHOLLY: (LAUGHS WITH RELIEF) If that’s careful, I’d hate to know what\nHOLLY: you’re like when you’re clumsy.\nSAI: Dylan?\nDYLAN: (SQUEEZING) I’m fine. Just had a bit of a scare, that’s all.\nSAI: Right. But take it slowly. This mine has enough ghosts in it without us joining them.\nSAI: #225a: VORTEX ICE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 5\nSAI: SCENE 2. INT. MINE WORKING.\nDOCTOR: (EMERGES, FX: SWITCHES ON TORCH) A cave. No, these walls have been excavated. A mine!\nDOCTOR: (NOTE: FLIP IN THIS EPISODE KNOWS EVERYTHING THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IN ADVANCE BUT PRETENDS SHE DOESN’T TO AVOID MAKING THE\nDOCTOR: SUSPICIOUS. ALTHOUGH THE DOCTOR HAS ALSO BEEN THROUGH\nALL: THIS BEFORE HE HAS LOST HIS MEMORY OF HAVING DONE SO, SO HE IS ACTING COMPLETELY AS NORMAL. )\nFLIP: (EMERGES) We’re underground?\nDOCTOR: Going by the ambient pressure, seven hundred feet underground.\nFLIP: Ambient pressure? You took a reading from the TARDIS console before we left, I saw you.\nDOCTOR: (DEFENSIVE) I was merely ascertaining our location and date.\nFLIP: I think it’s sweet that you still try to impress me. So where\nFLIP: is this mine, then?\nDOCTOR: Earth. Northern Mexico, Chihuahua.\nFLIP: Where the little dogs come from?\nDOCTOR: Where, as you say, the little dogs come from.\nFLIP: (EXHALES) No wonder it’s so hot.\nDOCTOR: The temperature is due to our depth, not our latitude.\nFLIP: What, cos we’re approaching the Earth’s core?\nFLIP: #225a: VORTEX ICE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 6\nDOCTOR: . Not quite.\nFLIP: No? (REACTING TO HEAT, WAFTING TOP) Like an oven, though. When- abouts are we? Past or future?\nDOCTOR: As far as you’re concerned, the present, give or take a few years.\nFLIP: So what are we doing here?\nDOCTOR: (SOMETHING AMISS?) You’re full of questions today, Flip.\nFLIP: (COVERING — SHE’S BEEN ASKING TOO MANY) Aren’t I normally? We didn’t arrive by accident, did we?\nDOCTOR: No, the TARDIS detected some exotic particles uncharacteristic of this planet.\nFLIP: Uncharacteristic? You mean they’re alien?\nDOCTOR: Extra-terrestrial. “Alien” is a relative term.\nFLIP: That explains that look in your eye.\nDOCTOR: What look?\nFLIP: That ‘I’ve found a mystery’ look. You love it!\nDOCTOR: I admit to taking a certain degree of satisfaction in the pursuit of knowledge -\nFLIP: (REACTS) Doctor — the wall! Someone’s coming out —\nFLIP: #225a: VORTEX ICE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 7\nDOCTOR: Yes. It seems we have company.\nDYLAN: (PICKING HIMSELF UP, SEEING THEM) Sacre bleu!\nDOCTOR: Ah. You have the quizzical look of a man who’s wondering what we're doing here.\nDYLAN: You could say that.\nSAI: (OFF) Dylan, what is it? Are you alright?\nDYLAN: I’m fine. But you’ve gotta see this for yourself, cos you’re not gonna believe it.\nDOCTOR: (WHISPER TO FLIP) Flip. They don’t appear to be armed, but be careful.\nFLIP: Will do.\nSAI: (EMERGING FROM GAP) So, what have you got for — oh my.\nDOCTOR: Hello!\nFLIP: Hiya!\nSAI: How the hell did you get down here?\nDOCTOR: Were... um...\nFLIP: Tourists.\nDOCTOR: Yes. Tourists.\nFLIP: Sightseeing.\nFLIP: #225a: VORTEX ICE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 8\nDOCTOR: Seeing the sights.\nFLIP: And we got lost.\nDOCTOR: Hopelessly misplaced ourselves.\nFLIP: And we fell down a hole.\nDOCTOR: Whoops-a-daisy!\nFLIP: Then we got lost again.\nDOCTOR: No sense of direction.\nFLIP: And ended up here. True story.\nJANNIK: (EMERGING FROM HOLE) What’s going on? (BEAT) Who are they?!\nDOCTOR: How many more of you are in there?\nDYLAN: Answer the question. Who are you?\nDOCTOR: I’m the Doctor, this is my friend Philippa Jackson —\nFLIP: But you can call me Flip.\nDOCTOR: And we’re clearly no threat. Your turn. Why are you here?\nSAI: We are here as part of a classified speleological research group.\nDOCTOR: Classified speleological research?\nDOCTOR: #225a: VORTEX ICE by Jonathan Morris\nFLIP: Doctor, what’s speel -\nDOCTOR: The study of caves.\nFLIP: Oh, right, yeah.\nHOLLY: Who are you talking to — oh!\nSAI: (FINAL) Page 9\nSAI: This is Holly Whitfield, physicist. The belligerent Frenchman\nSAI: is Dylan Argent, expert caver, exobiologist.\nDOCTOR: An exobiologist? Interesting.\nSAI: And I am Professor Sai Chopra,\nDOCTOR: Professor, I think we might be beneficial arrangement.\nSAT: What?\nDOCTOR: Pool our resources. After all,\nDOCTOR: thing - alien life!\nDOCTOR: and the German is Jannik Woolf,\nDOCTOR: leader of this expedition.\nDOCTOR: able to come to a mutually\nDOCTOR: we're both looking for the same\nDOCTOR: #225a: VORTEX ICE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 10\nDOCTOR: SCENE 3a. INT. MINE WORKING.\nJANNIK: You’re not letting them come with us, Professor?\nSAI: I don’t see that I have any choice, Jannik. (DRINKS)\nJANNIK: But we don’t know anything about them.\nSAT: So where would you rather have them? Where we can see them - or between us and the way out? If they caused a rockfall -\nJANNIK: I take your point.\nDYLAN: (BITES BAR) One of us could go back with them.\nSAI: And who would you nominate, Dylan? We’re all essential to the mission.\nJANNIK: Alright, they can come with us. But I don’t trust them.\nSAI: I’m not asking you to trust them. I’m asking you to keep an eye\nSAI: on them.\nCROSS TO: #225a: VORTEX ICE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 11\nCROSS TO: SCENE 3b. INT. MINE WORKING. [CONTINUOUS]\nCROSS TO: CHIRRUPING, BLEEPING GIZMO.\nHOLLY: What’s that?\nDOCTOR: A more sophisticated version of your own detector... Yes. The source of the exotic particles is almost directly beneath us.\nHOLLY: So it’s just a question of getting down there.\nFLIP: What do you think it is, the source?\nHOLLY: Impossible to say. Unless your friend has any ideas?\nDOCTOR: Me? No, I’m as in the dark as you are. Quite literally. Tell me, what led you to this mine?\nHOLLY: A satellite scanning for neutrinos picked up an energy spike, like nothing anybody had ever seen before.\nDOCTOR: So this source isn’t a new development?\nHOLLY: No. It could have been there forever. But obviously it might have some connection to the disaster.\nFLIP: What disaster?\nHOLLY: A hundred years ago there was an explosion. Only twenty miners made it out alive, the ones working on the upper levels. The rest were crushed, or trapped. Their bodies were never recovered.\nFLIP: How many were there?\nHOLLY: Over a hundred. But you must know this!\nHOLLY: #225a: VORTEX ICE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 12\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid we skimped on our research. So you’ve opened up the mine?\nHOLLY: We blasted our way into the upper level, and we’ve been working our way down ever since.\nFLIP: How long have you been down here?\nSAI: (JOINING THEM) Two days.\nFLIP: Woah.\nSAI: Why, how long have you been down here?\nFLIP: Oh, about the same, two days, yeah, the same.\nSAI: I see. Well, I’ve spoken to the others and we’ve agreed that you can join us.\nDOCTOR: Excellent.\nSAI: On two conditions. One — you give us your full co-operation.\nDOCTOR: It will be a pleasure.\nFLIP: And condition two?\nSAI: That both of you do exactly as I say. Any disobedience and I’11l have you both tied up - and then you’d better just hope that we remember to untie you on our way out.\nDOCTOR: In that case... your word is our command.\nSAI: Alright. In five minutes we’re gonna make an abseil descent of the northern shaft. Holly, if you could help us set up?\nSAI: #225a: VORTEX ICE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 13\nHOLLY: Yes, boss!\nFLIP: (HUSHED) Alright, Doctor, what is it?\nDOCTOR: What’s what?\nFLIP: You’re not telling them something. Well, you can tell me.\nDOCTOR: The exotic particles are comprised of Artron energy.\nFLIP: Is that supposed to mean something?\nDOCTOR: Artron energy is usually only found within the brain of a Time Lord... or a TARDIS.\nFLIP: So this thing everyone’s looking for, is probably a Time Lord?\nDOCTOR: (APPREHENSIVE SIGH) Yes.\nFLIP: But that’s good news isn’t it? One of your people.\nDOCTOR: So one would hope, but I can think of several likely candidates with whom I have no great desire to be re-acquainted.\nDOCTOR: #225a: VORTEX ICE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 14\nDOCTOR: SCENE 4. INT. LARGE CAVE.\nDOCTOR: GADGET. FLIP IS DESCENDING FROM ABOVE US WITH A SUCCESSION OF JOLTS AND SWINGS AGAINST THE ROCK FACE, GETTING CLOSER.\nFLIP: (ABSEILING, LOVING IT) Woah! Coming down! Watch out below!\nDYLAN: (CALLING UP TO HER) Use the brake bar! You’re going too fast!\nFLIP: (ABSEILING) I’1l be the judge of that, mate!\nSAI: Doctor, is your... friend always so reckless?\nDOCTOR: Always. It’s one of her most likeable qualities. She reminds me of myself, when I was in my early five-hundreds.\nDYLAN: Careful, you’re nearly there, three metres, two —\nFLIP: (LANDS) Woah! That was awesome. I get why you do this caving lark.\nSAI: It’s no ‘lark’. (CALLS UP) Alright, Jannik, your turn!\nFLIP: Blimey, it’s like a topical rainforest down here.\nDOCTOR: Yes, it must be nearly one-hundred percent humidity.\nDYLAN: (CALLS UP) Jannik, slow down! For heaven’s sake —\nJANNIK: #225a: VORTEX ICE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 15\nSAI: Jannik, are you alright?\nJANNIK: (GETS UP) The stupid descender didn’t grip. The rope’s soaking wet, was Slipping right through the bobbin.\nSAI: Well, we’ll have to bear that in mind on the way back... Right, Holly, which way?\nHOLLY: One of those two tunnels, that way or... that way. Oh no.\nFLIP: What is it?\nHOLLY: One of the miners.\nJANNIK: (PERTURBED) There are more over there... A dozen at least.\nSAI: Alright, Jannik, Holly, we were expecting this, we all knew what we were gonna find, so let’s keep it together.\nFLIP: (INTRIGUED RATHER THAN AFRAID) But they’re just... skeletons.\nHOLLY: Well, it has been a hundred years.\nFLIP: Yeah, but they’re not buried. Which means they didn’t die ina rockfall.\nDOCTOR: And there’s air down here, so they didn’t asphyxiate. And they could gather condensation to drink; the tunnel walls down here are dripping wet.\nFLIP: So they starved to death?\nFLIP: #225a: VORTEX ICE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 16\nDYLAN: More likely the heat got them first.\nHOLLY: Stuck down here, in the dark. I wonder if they thought they would be rescued, or whether they just gave up.\nSAI: I told you to keep it together. (BEAT) Right, two tunnels - we split into two groups. Jannik, Dylan, you take that one. Holly, Doctor, Flip, with me.\nFLIP: Okay, boss.\nSAI: Back here in fifteen minutes. And no disappearing acts. That’s\nSAI: an order.\nSAI: #225a: VORTEX ICE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 17\nSAI: SCENE 5. INT. CAVE (SPACESHIP).\nDOCTOR: This must’ve been one of the last tunnels to be excavated.\nFLIP: How can you possibly know that?\nDOCTOR: The salt seam has only been partially mined.\nFLIP: Maybe they gave up because of the heat.\nDOCTOR: (GOING AHEAD) Maybe...\nHOLLY: Your friend seems right at home.\nFLIP: Yes, this is a normal day out for us. What about you? Spend a lot of time down abandoned mines?\nHOLLY: Not really. I’ve spent the last ten years as a lab monkey at Caltech, then this job came up, and I put my name forward.\nFLIP: You volunteered?\nHOLLY: If we do find something down here, this could be my big break. A new form of energy, alien artefacts. Hello!\nFLIP: What are you doing?\nHOLLY: That’s blue halite. I told my daughter I’d bring her back a present.\nFLIP: (KNOWS SOMETHING BAD WILL HAPPEN TO HOLLY) You have a daughter?\nFLIP: #225a: VORTEX ICE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 18\nHOLLY: Yes. Chloe. Two years old. It’s her birthday party next week, we delayed it until I could be there, when they’re that age they don’t notice. Sorry, are you alright?\nFLIP: (TRYING NOT TO BE VISIBLY UPSET) I’m fine, fine. She must be very proud of her mum, going off exploring.\nHOLLY: I don’t think she really understands.\nFLIP: No, but she will —\nHOLLY: Oh my — what is that?!?\nFLIP: Oh wow! Looks like a giant metal golf ball that’s been smashed to pieces.\nDOCTOR: Indeed. The miners must have uncovered it during their excavations.\nSAI: They abandoned their lamps. They must have left in a hurry.\nHOLLY: But this.. is incredible. Fantastic. (FX: CAMERA) We have to record this. Every detail.\nSAI: I’ve never seen metal like that before, Doctor.\nDOCTOR: Well, you wouldn’t have, because you’re looking at the remains of an alien spaceship. And I’1l tell you something else.\nSAT: What?\nSAT: #225a: VORTEX ICE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 19\nDOCTOR: It’s not the source of the exotic particles.\nDOCTOR: #225a: VORTEX ICE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 20\nDOCTOR: SCENE 6. INT. TUNNEL.\nDYLAN: This place is like a maze.\nJANNIK: None of this area is on the map, it must have been excavated before the disaster.\nDYLAN: Looks like we’ve come to a dead end. In more ways than one.\nJANNIK: Poor fellows, they must have been killed when the roof caved ih oles\nDYLAN: No.\nJANNIK: No?\nDYLAN: These stones are loose. They could have dug themselves free.\nJANNIK: Meaning?\nDYLAN: Meaning they were dead before the roof caved in.\nJANNIK: Well, there’s no way through... Maybe we should try one of these other tunnels.\nDYLAN: Yeah, you’re right. No, wait. There’s something in there. (FX:\nFORCES: BOULDER OUT OF THE WAY) Look!\nJANNIK: A light?! There’s light!?\nJANNIK: #225a: VORTEX ICE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 21\nJANNIK: SCENE 7. INT. CAVE (SPACESHIP).\nHOLLY: The Doctor’s right. This isn’t the source of the particles.\nSAI: You mean, we’ve found an alien spacecraft by coincidence?\nDOCTOR: No, but you’re missing something very obvious.\nSAI: What? That a hundred years ago, the miners dug up the remains of a spacecraft that had lain undisturbed for a million years?\nFLIP: Yeah, but look at it. It’s like an eggshell.\nHOLLY: So?\nFLIP: So if you’re breaking into an egg, the bits go on the inside. These bits are on the outside.\nSAI: Something broke out.\nDOCTOR: Yes. When they dug it up, there was something inside. Something that was very much alive!\nSAI: We should get back to the northern shaft, Jannik and Dylan should be there by now.\nHOLLY: But this is what we’ve -\nSAI: You can talk all the photos you like later. Come on!\nSAI: #225a: VORTEX ICE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 22\nSAI: SCENE 8. INT. TUNNEL.\nDYLAN: (HEAVING) One more.\nJANNIK: We should go back.\nDYLAN: Not yet. I’m nearly through. It would be quicker if you helped.\nJANNIK: Alright, alright.\nJANNIK: WE HEAR QUIETLY AMBIENCE OF CRYSTAL CAVE (SEE NEXT SCENE).\nDYLAN: There! Now will you look at that.\nJANNIK: It’s like a.. a fairy grotto!\nDYLAN: Those crystals. It’s like the Naica* cave, the size of Grand Central Station. One for the record books! (*PRONOUNCED NIGH- KA, RHYMES WITH ‘BIKER’ )\nSAI: What the hell’s going on, why didn’t you —\nJANNIK: Dylan’s found us a cave.\nSAI: (SQUEEZES PAST HIM) Selenite beams. It’s impressive, I'll give you that.\nDOCTOR: And that’s not all.\nFLIP: It’s where those particles are coming from.\nFLIP: #225a: VORTEX ICE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 23\nHOLLY: What about the temperature?\nDYLAN: (CHECKS) Forty degrees. We’1ll be alright so long as we don’t\nDYLAN: stay in there too long.\nSAI: Then let’s take a closer look, shall we?\nSAI: #225a: VORTEX ICE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 24\nSAI: SCENE 9. INT. CRYSTAL CAVE.\nSAI: ECHO, PLUS EVER-PRESENT PIXIE TINKLE. ALL MOVEMENTS SCRAPING AND SLIPPING OVER SMOOTH CRYSTALS, DISLODGING SMALL PEBBLES.\nSAI: Watch your step, everyone. These crystals are like ice.\nHOLLY: If only they were as cold as ice.\nFLIP: Doctor, the crystals are glowing.\nDOCTOR: Beautiful, isn’t it? Some quality of phosphorescence?\nSAI: Or gamma radiation? Good point, Holly, can you —\nHOLLY: Already ahead of you. Radiation levels are above average, but within safety margins.\nDYLAN: (IN DISTANCE) (CALLS OUT) Hey, I think we’ve found your source. Over here!\nJANNIK: What is it?\nSAI: Your guess is as good as mine.\nHOLLY: Some kind of creature.. Trapped in the crystal, like a fly in amber.\nJANNIK: Some fly! More like an octopus.\nSAI: Or a robot. It’s made of the same metal as the spaceship.\nDYLAN: Spaceship?\nDYLAN: #225a: VORTEX ICE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 25\nDOCTOR: This is its pilot. A cyborg. Half-organic, half-machine.\nFLIP: Have you seen anything like it before?\nDOCTOR: No. Not that I recall, and it would certainly stick in the mind. Seven legs, telescopic ommatophores and razor teeth.\nFLIP: Don’t touch it —\nDOCTOR: It’s alright. The crystal is quite solid. If it is crystal.\nSAI: What do you mean, ‘if’?\nDOCTOR: No. It’s ice.\nHOLLY: Ice? In this heat?\nDOCTOR: Vortex ice. Crystalline stasis.\nFLIP: Doctor, nobody knows what you’re talking about.\nDOCTOR: Frozen chunks of time.\nJANNIK: (INCREDULOUS LAUGH) Time?\nDOCTOR: Time. Solid time. Projections of four-dimensional space. Within the ice, the passage of time is brought to a standstill.\nDYLAN: Like cryogenics?\nDOCTOR: Broadly speaking, yes, but more accurately speaking, no.\nDOCTOR: #225a: VORTEX ICE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 26\nFLIP: And this thing is giving off the particles?\nDOCTOR: No, no... But it’s somewhere in here.\nSAI: Okay, Dylan, with me. Holly, Jannik, you go with them.\nJANNIK: I’d like to examine the specimen, if I may. It is alien life.\nSAI: Alright. But everyone. Stay within sight and the moment I say we leave, we leave. The clock is ticking.\nSAI: #225a: VORTEX ICE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 27\nSAI: SCENE 10. INT. CRYSTAL CAVE.\nSAI: Well, Jannik?\nDYLAN: A dead end. Another rockfall. I don’t think there’s any way through.\nSAI: But there was a way through before? A second cave?\nDYLAN: There might be, but we’d have to cut through the crystals —\nSAI: If that’s even possible.\nDYLAN: You don’t actually believe the Doctor? Frozen time?\nSAT: In the last hour, I’ve met two people wandering around a tunnel that’s taken us two days to reach, I’ve seen a cave of giant crystals, the remains of an alien spaceship and its pilot. Right now, I'll believe anything.\nDYLAN: Well, believe me when I say that if we stay here much longer we run a serious risk of heatstroke.\nSAT: Point taken. Let’s find the others.\nSAT: #225a: VORTEX ICE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 28\nSAT: SCENE 11. INT. CRYSTAL CAVE.\nDOCTOR: This way. Getting very close. Five metres. Four metres. Three —\nDOCTOR: Oh my.\nFLIP: Well, you did say you thought it might be a Time Lord.\nDOCTOR: Yes, but not that one. Not him!\nHOLLY: What are you talking about — (REACTS) What on Earth. But... but that’s you!\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nHOLLY: You, in the crystal.\nDOCTOR: In, aS you so accurately observe, the crystal.\nHOLLY: What is this, some sort of joke?\nDOCTOR: No joke. And it’s not just me. Look.\nFLIP: Oh no. That’s me!\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry.\nFLIP: But, that’s me, frozen in the... thing. Me as I am now. She’s even wearing the same clothes!\nDOCTOR: Yes. (FX: WIPES CRYSTAL WITH SLEEVE) The inimitable Philippa Jackson.\nDOCTOR: #225a: VORTEX ICE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 29\nHOLLY: What are they, copies?\nDOCTOR: No. They’re us. Or rather, they will be.\nHOLLY: What?\nDOCTOR: They are our future selves. At some point in our personal timelines, Flip and I will end up entombed in vortex ice.\nFLIP: How can you be so sure?\nDOCTOR: Well, do you remember being trapped in this ice?\nFLIP: (CAUTIOUSLY) No, but...\nDOCTOR: Then it must be something that hasn’t happened yet, mustn’t it?\nFLIP: Yeah, but how can you be sure it will happen?\nDOCTOR: Because we have found ourselves in the ice. Therefore it has happened, therefore it will happen, therefore it must happen.\nDOCTOR: (NOTE: FLIP HAS A PERSONAL INTEREST IN THIS DISCUSSION ABOUT\nWHETHER: THEY CAN CHANGE ESTABLISHED EVENTS, SHE’S NOT JUST\nASKING: QUESTIONS FOR THE SAKE OF IT.)\nFLIP: ‘Must’? Don’t we get any choice in the matter?\nDOCTOR: This is our destiny. It has now been written. If we try to avoid our fate, the resulting paradox would be calamitous.\nFLIP: Yeah, but actually, though, would anyone care?\nDOCTOR: I’d care, and so would half this galaxy when the other half suddenly went missing.\nDOCTOR: #225a: VORTEX ICE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 30\nFLIP: Alright then. Say these are our ‘future selves’. Are they dead?\nDOCTOR: No. No, I don’t think so. Merely frozen in an instant.\nFLIP: Then we have to get them out. Because I don’t know about you, but I don’t much fancy being stuck in a block of ice for all eternity!\nSAI: Alright, time to leave. One hour cool down, then you can come back and — what? What is it?\nHOLLY: We found our source.\nSAI: (SEES DOCTOR AND FLIP IN ICE) I see. Well, that makes about as much sense as anything else around here. Okay, you two, you’ve got some explaining to do.\nSAI: FADE OUT.\nSAI: #225a: VORTEX ICE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 31\nSAI: SCENE 12. INT. CAVE (SPACESHIP).\nEVERYONE: IS DRINKING WATER/MOPPING BROWS DURING SCENE.\nHOLLY: You’re time travellers?\nDOCTOR: Yes. Our vehicle is not far from where you found us.\nFLIP: We’d only just arrived, you see.\nSAI: So where are you from, originally?\nFLIP: Well, originally, Thamesmead, East London. It’s near Woolwich.\nDOCTOR: And I’m from Gallifrey, constellation of Kasterborous. It’s just to the left of Karn, you can’t miss it.\nDYLAN: You’re an alien from another planet?\nDOCTOR: Very much so.\nFLIP: So the exotic particles we’ve been looking for, they’re coming\nFLIP: from you? I mean, future you?\nDOCTOR: Yes. It’s a form of Time Lord distress call.\nFLIP: Which we picked up and answered. Does that even make sense?\nDOCTOR: It does raise some fascinating ontological issues, regarding the nature of cause and effect —\nSAT: What the —\nSAT: #225a: VORTEX ICE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 32\nJANNIK: Sorry, that was me, was just getting water and tripped over one of the fans.\nSAI: Try not to get yourself killed if you can help it. Alright, Doctor, what do you know about the other thing, the cyborg?\nDOCTOR: I’m afraid I can’t help you. I’ve never seen it before. This is all in my future, you see. Evidently, my friend and I will come to this mine a hundred years ago, and end up entombed, but beyond that, I’m afraid your guess is as good as mine.\nSAI: Can we get them out of the ice, your future selves?\nDOCTOR: I’ve been wondering about that. If we caused the temporal field to collapse, it should be possible.\nJANNIK: And can you do that, that thing you just said?\nDOCTOR: With the Professor’s permission...?\nSAI: Just do it. Okay, break over, we can — wait. Where’s Holly?\nJANNIK: She was here.\nDYLAN: And the girl, Flip? Where is she?\nDYLAN: #225a: VORTEX ICE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 33\nDYLAN: SCENE 13. INT. CRYSTAL CAVE.\nHOLLY: Flip. What are you doing?\nFLIP: I just wanted to take another look.\nHOLLY: At yourself?\nFLIP: You make it sound all egotistical. Though, look at my hair, it’s all fluffy at the back. Do I really look like that?\nHOLLY: Flip, can I ask you something?\nFLIP: What?\nHOLLY: Earlier. When I mentioned my daughter. You acted like you knew something.\nFLIP: (COVERING UP, BUT FEELING GUILTY) No, I didn’t, I don’t.\nHOLLY: But you’re a time traveller —\nFLIP: That doesn’t mean I know what’s going to happen.\nHOLLY: No?\nFLIP: No. I don’t know any more than you do, I don’t know how I end up trapped in the ice — woah (SHIVERS)\nHOLLY: What is it?\nFLIP: A drop of cold water, went right down my back.\nFLIP: #225a: VORTEX ICE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 34\nHOLLY: Flip, what do you know about vortex ice?\nFLIP: Not much, why?\nHOLLY: Because it seems to be melting.\nFLIP: You’re right.

I need you to get everything ready for an ascent.\nJANNIK: Right. (HEADS OFF)\nFLIP: Doctor, the cyborg, it isn’t following us.\nDOCTOR: No. It must need to prioritise feeding over hunting.\nSAT: So how long have we got?\nDOCTOR: However long it takes for it to absorb all the molecular energy from its, ah, breakfast.

If we get back to the TARDIS.\nDOCTOR: #225a: VORTEX ICE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 50\nSAI: The TARDIS?\nDOCTOR: My time machine. Once we’re there, I can deal with the cyborg.\nSAI: Okay, that sounds like something resembling a plan. Jannik, how are you doing with the ropes? Jannik? Jannik?\nFLIP: He’s gone.\nSAT: What?\nFLIP: Up the rope. He’s not hanging about.\nSAI: (SHOUTS OUT) Jannik!! (NORMAL) He won’t get far. Okay, two ropes. How shall we do this? Doctor, you and... one of the Flips next.\nDOCTOR: No, you should go.\nSAI: Doctor. I’m in charge of this expedition, what’s left of it.\nDOCTOR: There’s no time to argue, Professor. You’re going next. Flip.\nFLIP: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Which one are you? Oh, it doesn’t matter. Quick, put on the belt and buckle yourself to the ascender.\nFLIP: Got it. How does it work?\nDOCTOR: It’s quite simple, you move this up the rope, lock, pull yourself up, move this up, lock, unlock this, and repeat.\nFLIP: Sounds complicated. Sorry, I’ve never done this before.\nFLIP: #225a: VORTEX ICE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 51\nSAI: I’ll be right beside you, I’11 talk you through it.\nFLIP: Okay.\nDOCTOR: Then up you go.\nFLIP: (HEAVE) And lock, which one, ah got it.

(NOTE: FLIP IS LYING)\nSAI: (DISAPPOINTED) Oh.\nFLIP: Why?\nSAI: Because I want to ask your future self why she just let two of my friends die.\nFLIP: (AS SHE IS THE FUTURE ONE, THIS HITS HER) I’m not sure she did.\nSAI: She’s already been through all this, hasn’t she? She knows what’s going to happen. So she could have saved them.\nFLIP: I don’t think it works like that.\nSAT: No?\nSAT: #225a: VORTEX ICE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 53\nFLIP: No. I think maybe she had no choice, cos she has to make sure things happen how they did before. For her, I mean. Once something’s been done, you can’t undo it, no matter how much you want to.\nFLIP: #225a: VORTEX ICE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 54\nFLIP: SCENE 24. INT.

What spaceship?\nDOCTOR: (REALISES SOMETHING IS UP) Flip, what’s the last thing you remember?\nPAST FLIP: I don’t know. I remember us getting out of the TARDIS. But nothing after that.\nDOCTOR: Of course! Short-term memory loss, from exposure to vortex ice!\nPAST FLIP: That’s what she said, when I woke up.\nDOCTOR: Yes, well — sorry, who told you that?\nPAST FLIP: The other me, the future me.\nDOCTOR: No, Flip, you’re confused. You were in the vortex ice, so you're the one from the future.\nPAST FLIP: Er, no, I’m not. She is. The one up there, dangling.\nDOCTOR: (REALISING) Then as far as she’s concerned this is all the second time around — (NOTE: THIS IS THE POINT WHERE THE DOCTOR\nREALIZES: THAT HE’S GOT THE PAST AND FUTURE FLIPS THE WRONG WAY AROUND)\nJANNIK: #225a: VORTEX ICE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL)\nJANNIK: SCENE 25.

(FX: SHE DOES IT, ZIPPING DOWN THE ROPE) Woah!\nSAI: (TO HERSELF) And then there was one.\nSAI: #225a: VORTEX ICE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 56\nSAI: SCENE 26. INT.

Watch out!\nFLIP: (LANDS WITH A THUD) Woah.\nDOCTOR: Are you alright?\nFLIP: Yeah, I think so, but -\nSAI: (LANDING BADLY) Ow!\nDOCTOR: Sai —\nSAI: (TESTING INJURY) My leg. Not broken. I’11 live.\nPAST FLIP: It’s going. Why not kill us?\nDOCTOR: Because there’s more to eat on the surface.\nSAI: And we’re — (OUCH!) trapped.\nDOCTOR: No. If it got up there, so can we. One of these tunnels must lead to an upper level.\nPAST FLIP: But which one?\nDOCTOR: Ah. Well. Your guess is as good as mine. (BEAT) No, wait.\nDOCTOR: #225a: VORTEX ICE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 57\nSAT: What?\nDOCTOR: The Flip from the future. She would know which tunnel to take.\nFLIP: Well don’t look at me, I’m not the future one.\nDOCTOR: It’s alright, you can stop pretending. I know.\nSAT: Know what?\nDOCTOR: I was wrong. The Flip frozen in the ice wasn’t from the future. This is the first time she’s been through this.\nPAST FLIP: Exactly! And it’s the sort of thing I’d remember!\nDOCTOR: Whereas the Flip I arrived with knows exactly what’s going to happen.\nFLIP: (STEELS HERSELF TO ADMIT THE TRUTH) Yes, I do. But I can’t tell you, I’m sorry.\nSAI: Well, that’s useful!\nDOCTOR: Maybe not, but you have to ensure that events occur as they did the first time around. So, which tunnel did we take then?\nFLIP: (RELUCTANTLY) That one. We went that way.\nDOCTOR: Then that’s the way we shall go. Past Flip, I hope you’re paying attention, because I’ll be asking questions later.\nDOCTOR: #225a: VORTEX ICE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 58\nDOCTOR: SCENE 27. INT.

The other one, stay with the Professor.\nDOCTOR: FLIP/PAST FLIP: Right/Okay.\nDOCTOR: We'll be back in a few minutes. Careful, it’s very slippery.\nPAST FLIP: (SLIPS ON LOOSE STONE) Woah!\nDOCTOR: (AS THEY HEAD OFF) I did tell you.\nPAST FLIP: (AS THEY HEAD OFF) Yeah, alright, I'll remember for next time.\nSAI: (WAITS UNTIL THEY HAVE GONE) So you’re the future one. Everything that’s happened, you’ve known was going to happen, and let it happen.\nFLIP: Look, what could I have done?

Next week, it’s her birthday.\nSAT: What about me?\nFLIP: What?\nSAI: Come on, tell me. Do I get out of this alive?\nFLIP: I can’t...\nSAT: Can’t or won’t?\nFLIP: Even if I told you, you wouldn’t believe me.\nSAI: Try me.\nFLIP: Alright. Yes. You survive, you get out of this okay.\nSAI: You’re lying.\nFLIP: I said you wouldn’t believe me.\nSAT: What was that?\nFLIP: What?\nSAI: Something behind us, down the tunnel.\nFLIP: Probably just a small rock-fall.\nSAI: Or the cyborg.\nSAI: #225a: VORTEX ICE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 60\nFLIP: They’re coming back. Doctor!\nDOCTOR: (RETURNING) Alright, there’s a way up to the next level ahead.\nSAI: Then let’s get a move on, shall we? Cos if that thing is coming after us, I don’t fancy hanging around.\nSAI: #225a: VORTEX ICE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 61\nSAI: SCENE 28. INT. TUNNEL.\nDOCTOR: Which way now?\nFLIP: Um... the TARDIS is this way, I think. No, this way.\nDOCTOR: Are you sure?\nFLIP: (SARCASTIC) Yeah, cos all these tunnels are really memorable and different-looking!\nDOCTOR: Right. Other Flip?\nPAST FLIP: (A LITTLE WAY OFF, WITH SAT) Yeah?\nDOCTOR: Look around you, you’1ll need to remember this.\nPAST FLIP: Why? What?\nDOCTOR: Look around you, try to find something memorable!\nPAST FLIP: (SARCASTIC) What like? That spade?\nFLIP: (REMEMBERING) Yes, I remember this bit now, I’ve seen that spade before, yes, it’s this way, definite.\nDOCTOR: Professor?\nSAI: (WALKING UNAIDED) I’m right behind you, it’s easier if I keep moving. (WINCES)\nFLIP: Do you want some help —\nFLIP: #225a: VORTEX ICE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 62\nSAI: No, I’m fine. You’ve done enough.\nFLIP: I’m sorry.\nSAI: I don’t see what good apologising will do.\nFLIP: I didn’t want any of this, this wasn’t my idea.\nSAI: Then what are you saying sorry for?\nFLIP: Because earlier, you were right. I was lying to you.\nDOCTOR: Oh, marvellous.\nPAST FLIP: A dead end? I thought you said this was the way out?\nFLIP: I didn’t say that.\nDOCTOR: You must have misremembered. Please try to concentrate.\nFLIP: I didn’t “misremember” Doctor.\nSAI: No. She’s brought us here. So that something can happen. To me. Well, I’m not gonna stand around and get killed. That is not gonna happen... This time, it’s gonna be different.\nFLIP: (QUIETLY TO HERSELF) I’m afraid it’s not.\nSAI: Whatever it is, it can happen to you, I’m not -\nSAI: ARRIVES, SLITHERING FROM THE ROOF.\nSAI: #225a: VORTEX ICE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 63\nBIDES: ITS TIME, MAKES OCCASIONAL NOISES.\nFLIP: (REGRETFUL) I knew it would happen, and I couldn’t stop it.\nPAST FLIP: What? This is all your fault, you — (big)\nFLIP: Don’t you get all shirty with me! I had to bring us here.\nPAST FLIP: Oh you had to, did you? And you had to let Professor Sai die?\nFLIP: Yes! Because that’s how it happened before, don’t you see?\nDOCTOR: Part of the sequence of events that resulted in us getting out of this alive. Change one thing, one tiny detail, and you jeopardise the whole future timeline!\nPAST FLIP: But we’re trapped. There is literally no way out. I’m dead, you’re dead, she’s dead. We’re all dead!\nDOCTOR: Yes, I must confess, the situation does look rather bleak.\nFLIP: Not quite.\nPAST DOCTOR: (EMERGING)\nPAST DOCTOR: That’s it. Take a big sniff. Lots of lovely Artron energy. Here, boy! Here!\nPAST DOCTOR: That’s it! Get it while it’s hot! (BACKING AWAY) Woah!\nPAST DOCTOR: #225a: VORTEX ICE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 64\nPAST DOCTOR: BITE THE TARDIS, THEN GROANS DROWSILY, CONTENTEDLY.\nPAST FLIP: What’s it doing?\nDOCTOR: The Artron emissions from the TARDIS. It’s like catnip.\nPAST FLIP: Catnip?\nDOCTOR: (ANNOYED TO HAVE BEEN GAZUMPED) This is exactly what Id intended to do, when we got back to the TARDIS!\nFLIP: Yeah, but you already have done.\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry?\nFLIP: The Doctor in there, he’s your past self. The one that was in the ice!\nDOCTOR: Then, if I’ve done all this before, why don’t I remember it?\nFLIP: (QUIET) I’1ll explain later.\nPAST DOCTOR: Hello, um, everyone! Sorry to interrupt!\nDOCTOR: Not at all, Doctor. I must say, though, you cut it rather fine!\nPAST DOCTOR: I came as fast as I could. Once I was thawed out, it took a while to find your TARDIS -\nDOCTOR: (AFFRONTED) My TARDIS?\nPAST DOCTOR: Yes, hope you don’t mind me borrowing it, only mine is... unavailable.\nPAST DOCTOR: #225a: VORTEX ICE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 65\nPAST FLIP: Oh, I remember now, the tunnel, it was all vortex-iced!\nFLIP: I said it would come back to you.\nDOCTOR: Well, it hasn’t come back to me. Sorry, but how did you even find my TARDIS?\nPAST DOCTOR: With this. I found it in the cave where I was defrosted. Serves as a rather useful TARDIS sniffer-outer.\nDOCTOR: Ah, I’d rather like that back, if it’s all the same to you.\nPAST DOCTOR: Here, catch. (THROWS IT) Now, if you’1ll excuse me, I’d better head off before this fellow wakes up. Which one of you is my Flip?\nPAST FLIP: I’m not ‘your’ Flip, I’m not anyone’s.\nPAST DOCTOR: Alright, which one of you was frozen in the vortex ice?\nPAST FLIP: Me.\nPAST DOCTOR: Then you come with me.\nPAST FLIP: Fine, fine. (TO OTHER FLIP) Nice meeting you, future me. Look forward to doing this again. Not.\nFLIP: Nice meeting you too. Take care of yourself, or I won’t be here to tell you this.\nDOCTOR: Excuse me. I think you have some explaining to do first!\nPAST DOCTOR: Don’t you remember all this?\nPAST DOCTOR: #225a: VORTEX ICE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 66\nDOCTOR: No, I don’t.\nPAST DOCTOR: Oh. Well, ask your Flip, I’m sure she’1ll fill you in. You know\nPAST DOCTOR: what I’m like with explanations!\nDOCTOR: But that’s my TARDIS, you can’t just fly off in it!\nPAST DOCTOR: Oh, can’t I?\nDOCTOR: Well, he has to be the most the rude, incorrigible —\nFLIP: He’s you!\nDOCTOR: - handsome, intelligent and perceptive person I have ever met.\nFLIP: They’re off.\nDOCTOR: Taking the cyborg with them. Well, I’ve always wondered what it felt like when I came to the rescue.\nDOCTOR: Now, you heard my former self. You have some explaining to do.\nFLIP: Alright, well, it all began when we landed in this mine, where the miners had just dug up an alien spaceship —\nDOCTOR: No, not that. What I want to know is, where have those two just\nDOCTOR: gone?\nFLASHBACK INTO: #225a: VORTEX ICE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 67\nFLASHBACK INTO: SCENE 29. INT. CAVE.\nPAST DOCTOR: Ah; good, 1's. stall out -cold.\nPAST FLIP: It travelled with us?\nPAST DOCTOR: Yes. The TARDIS wasn’t keen, but I insisted.\nPAST FLIP: So where are we? (REMEMBERING) Wait.. This is the cave where we first landed!\nPAST DOCTOR: Look behind you.\nPAST FLIP: Another TARDIS?\nPAST DOCTOR: (FX: HE PATS THE SIDE) My TARDIS.\nPAST FLIP: The one we arrived in?\nPAST DOCTOR: So now we can return the other to its original owner. Hey... Presto!\nPAST FLIP: You did not just set up the TARDIS to vanish with you saying\nPAST FLIP: ‘Hey Presto’.\nPAST DOCTOR: No, it was on a timer.\nPAST DOCTOR: OUT OF FLASHBACK.\nPAST DOCTOR: #225a: VORTEX ICE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 68\nPAST DOCTOR: SCENE 30. INT. TUNNEL.\nFLIP: . So the Doctor sent the other TARDIS back.\nDOCTOR: Back to where?\nFLIP: Back to its original owner, you said.\nFLIP: Wait, what’s that —\nDOCTOR: My TARDIS!\nDOCTOR: Of course. You remember my former self sending the TARDIS to my\nDOCTOR: future self, here, now.\nFLIP: Right, yeah, if you say so.\nDOCTOR: But the cyborg that was clinging to the outside, what happened £0°1t?\nFLIP: Oh, when the TARDIS took off, it left it behind...\nFLIP: #225a: VORTEX ICE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 69\nFLIP: SCENE 31. INT. CAVE.\nPAST FLIP: So, what do we do, just leave it here?\nPAST DOCTOR: For it to cause more death and mayhem? No. Flip, you asked me where we were. But a more pertinent question might be when.\nPAST FLIP: When?\nPAST DOCTOR: Listen.\nPAST DOCTOR: STARTING WITH A SERIES OF EXPLOSIONS.\nPAST FLIP: That’s you, blowing up the mine!\nPAST DOCTOR: Yes. Bang on cue. And any second...\nFLIP: Oh no.\nDOCTOR: Ah. It seems... the creature is still alive...\nFLIP: And it’s between us and the TARDIS!\nFLIP: 19 PLAYS OUT IN B/G UNDER THE FOLLOWING:\nPAST FLIP: But that’s us, that’s —\nPAST DOCTOR: Our former selves, yes. About to become entombed in vortex ice.\nPAST FLIP: I don’t get it, why have we come back here?\nPAST DOCTOR: Think about what happened next.\nPAST DOCTOR: #225a: VORTEX ICE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 70\nPAST DOCTOR: SOUND. SLOPPING, SLOSHING MUD.\nPAST FLIP: I remember. The cyborg filled the tunnel leading to the TARDIS\nPAST FLIP: with vortex ice.\nPAST DOCTOR: Yes.\nPAST FLIP: This tunnel, the one we’re standing in right now!\nPAST FLIP: OUT OF FLASHBACK.\nPAST FLIP: #225a: VORTEX ICE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 71\nPAST FLIP: SCENE 32. INT. TUNNEL.\nFLIP: And then suddenly this great big tidal wave gushed into the cave, and the cyborg was covered in it.\nDOCTOR: Trapping it in the vortex ice it had itself secreted! Hoist by its own petard!\nFLIP: Yeah, you said that before. So anyway, all this sloshy ice stuff was slooshing in —\nFLIP: #225a: VORTEX ICE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 72\nFLIP: SCENE 33. INT. CAVE.\nPAST DOCTOR: Quickly, Flip, into the TARDIS!\nPAST FLIP: It’s locked, I haven’t got a key.\nPAST DOCTOR: Hold on, it’s in one of my pockets.\nPAST FLIP: This is no time for you to have one of your ‘pockets’ moments.\nPAST DOCTOR: (FIND KEY) Here.\nPAST DOCTOR: Now, inside! (SUDDEN PAIN) Aaaargh.\nPAST FLIP: Doctor, what is it?\nPAST DOCTOR: Flip! Quick!\nPAST DOCTOR: #225a: VORTEX ICE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 73\nPAST DOCTOR: SCENE 34. INT. TARDIS CONSOLE ROOM. (CONTINUOUS)\nPAST DOCTOR: (IN PAIN) — the doors!\nPAST FLIP: Got it.\nPAST FLIP: What happened?\nPAST DOCTOR: Got... splashed by some vortex ice.\nPAST FLIP: What, so you’re going to be all crystallised again?\nPAST DOCTOR: No, not this time. Unlike our friend outside...\nPAST FLIP: Woah, the cyborg thing’s all encased in ice.\nPAST DOCTOR: Yes. Hoist by its own petard.\nPAST FLIP: We’re taking off?\nPAST DOCTOR: Yes. (WEAKENING) Vitally important to complete the circle. Listen, Flip. I.. need you to do something for me.\nPAST FLIP: What?\nPAST DOCTOR: The vortex ice.. I’m going to lose my short-term memory, I won’t remember any of this. And you must not tell me.\nPAST FLIP: Why not?\nPAST FLIP: #225a: VORTEX ICE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 74\nPAST DOCTOR: (IN PAIN, BUT FIGHTING IT) The TARDIS will land back in the mine. Everything has to happen as it did before.\nPAST FLIP: Before? What do you mean?\nPAST DOCTOR: Make sure you and the Doctor end up where I came to rescue you. But you cannot tell him.. pretend not to know...\nPAST FLIP: Hang on, though, but why -\nPAST DOCTOR: (WEAKENING) Promise me. Events must unfold as they did before! Change one thing, one tiny detail -\nPAST FLIP: Alright, I know! I promise, I promise.\nPAST DOCTOR: One more thing. You can’t save anyone.\nPAST FLIP: What —\nPAST DOCTOR: Sai, Holly, Dylan and Jannik. You have to let them die.\nPAST FLIP: (HORRIFIED) I have to let them die? You can’t ask me to do that. (ALMOST TEARFUL BUT FIERCELY INDIGNANT) No. It’s not fair!\nPAST DOCTOR: I’m sorry, Flip. But -\nPAST FLIP: (TRYING TO WAKE HIM) Oh, don’t you cop out on me like that! Doctor? Doctor? (SUDDENLY ALONE) Oh. What do I do now?\nPAST FLIP: #225a: VORTEX ICE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 75\nPAST FLIP: SCENE 35. INT. TUNNEL.\nFLIP: So I was stuck in the TARDIS while you were in a sort of coma thing with your face all frosty. That went on for a couple of hours, so I went to my room for a nap. Then, when I got up, you were full of beans, ready to explore the cave we’d just landed in —\nDOCTOR: (EMERGES, FX: SWITCHES ON TORCH) A cave. No, these walls have\nDOCTOR: been excavated. A mine!\nFLIP: (EMERGES) We’re underground?\nFLIP: OUT OF FLASHBACK.\nFLIP: And, well, you know the rest.\nDOCTOR: Yes. I daresay it will all come back to me in the fullness of time. (FX: DOCTOR OPENS TARDIS) Thank you, Flip.\nFLIP: For what?\nDOCTOR: For completing the circle.\nDOCTOR: #225a: VORTEX ICE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 76\nDOCTOR: SCENE 36. INT. TARDIS CONSOLE ROOM.\nFLIP: Doctor. They were good people. And I had to let them die.\nDOCTOR: You didn’t have any choice.\nFLIP: That didn’t make it any easier.\nDOCTOR: Yes. I know.\nFLIP: (ANGRY) No, you don’t! You have no idea what it’s like!\nDOCTOR: I have some. “Whatever Fate ordains, danger or hurt,\nDOCTOR: Or death predestined, nothing can avert.” It is the curse of the time traveller. To know there are lives you cannot save, injustices you cannot prevent. Once the die has been cast, the die has been cast, irrevocably and for evermore.\nFLIP: This is what it’s like for you all the time?\nDOCTOR: I’d like to be able to say you get used to it... But even after all these centuries, I haven’t. (BEAT) I can’t make it up to you. I can’t make it right. But I can say thank you.\nFLIP: Go on then, how?\nDOCTOR: By showing you the reason why I keep going. By showing you that life goes on, and that the universe is full of joy and wonder and sights beyond your wildest imaginings. I know... I’1ll take you to —\nDOCTOR: END OF EPISODE TWO\nDOCTOR: #225a: VORTEX ICE by Jonathan Morris (FINAL) Page 77\nDOCTOR: NOTE: THE ORDER OF EVENTS FOR THE DOCTOR AND FLIP.\nDOCTOR: THEY ARRIVE IN THE MINE, MEETS SOME MINERS WHO HAVE UNCOVERED AN ALIEN.

But the opera’s not the main attraction.\nFLIP: An opera? Is it all singing? Because I’m not great with musicals, Doctor. I only really like them when a big chandelier or a helicopter comes down.\nDOCTOR: Oh, there’ll be something rather more impressive than that tonight!\nFLIP: So what’s it got to do with flying cars? Are they going to fly one in?\nDOCTOR: (SIGH) The cars are levitated electro-magnetically, Flip. This planet has an exceptionally strong magnetic field which the locals have rather cleverly exploited. The skies of Festin are a constantly shifting lattice of projected energy roadways!\nFLIP: If you say so.\nDOCTOR: But that strong magnetic field is what causes glorious light shows, when charged particles enter the upper atmosphere...\nFLIP: Like the Northern Lights?\nFLIP: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL) Page 7\nDOCTOR: A lot like the Northern Lights, yes. However unlike the Aurora Borealis on Earth, these lights stretch far across the globe. Snaking swirls of yellow and red and green...\nFLIP: So, we’re going to see a musical outdoors and the sky’1l light up?\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nFLIP: I hope the food’s good.

Got it.\nDOCTOR: That’s Guitonus, this system’s nearest neighbour. It’s around two light days away.\nFLIP: Light days?\nDOCTOR: Yes, it’s a subdivision of light years. Don’t pretend you don’t know. (SMUG) That star exploded one and a half days ago.\nFLIP: But we can still see it?\nDOCTOR: Yes, because the light from it exploding hasn’t got here yet, but tonight it will. As we sit in that arena, energy from its death will bombard the ionosphere. There’1ll be a globe-spanning aurora more dramatic than any Festin’s ever seen... and, thanks to time travel, we’ll be the only ones expecting it!\nFLIP: No-one here knows it’s about to explode?\nDOCTOR: No!\nFLIP: But they’re so advanced - this city, those cars. I’d have thought they’d have sensors or something.\nDOCTOR: No. From what I gather the Festins don’t have a passion for Space research. Maybe this’1ll spur an interest.\nDOCTOR: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL) Page 10\nFLIP: You must have seen stuff like this before, though?\nDOCTOR: Yes, once or twice.. but never with a whole theatre audience... and never through your eyes, Flip.\nFLIP: You want me to feel like you, don’t you? One step ahead of the crowd.\nDOCTOR: What’s wrong with that?\nFLIP: Hey - there’s an aircar parked by the bridge! Let’s see we can sweet-talk the driver into giving us a lift.\nDOCTOR: You good at sweet-talking aliens?\nFLIP: (CALLING BACK) Must be!

Maybe I’m in the wrong language? So, this nothing you’re doing - is it any particular kind of nothing?\nHALUS: No, I was just standing on the bridge here, thinking. Looking at the river, watching the sunset...\nFLIP: Oh good. (CAUTIOUS) Because there was this man my mum knew. Long time ago now. He went thinking by the river once... (BEAT) You weren’t thinking bad stuff?\nDOCTOR: (BONHOMIE) Hello, I see you’ve met my friend Flip! I’m the Doctor and we were wondering...\nFLIP: Not now, Doctor. (BEAT) Are you OK, Halus?\nHALUS: Me? Course. Just a hard day. Needed to compose myself. Sort my thoughts out. Well, you’re a physician - you’1ll understand.\nDOCTOR: Regrettably, I’m not that kind of doctor.\nFLIP: Tell me.\nHALUS: It’s just stuff, the usual. To start with I’ve just finished a job and that’s always hard, a team breaking up-\nFLIP: What do you do?\nHALUS: Airway projection, we weave the roads up there.\nDOCTOR: You engineer all that? Quite a feat! Tell me, the field fluctuations-\nDOCTOR: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL) Page 14\nHALUS: I’m not an elite. I’m on the practical side, getting the projector arrays set up.\nDOCTOR: Ah.\nFLIP: You said “to start with”. So that’s not the only thing bothering you.\nHALUS: No. The next job’s the worry. The Cortex has stopped offering work, hasn’t it? Nothing for labourers like me. Don’t know what I’m doing next...\nFLIP: Something will come up, a city this size must need constant repairs.\nHALUS: Oh, it does, all the time now. And that’s the other thing, the one that made me... come here. I heard there’d been another Nihilist attack. They seem to be all the time now. It gets to you, doesn’t it?\nFLIP: So, you just wanted to take a bit of time out to watch the sun set...?\nHALUS: I guess. (SHEEPISH) I needed to look at something beautiful.\nDOCTOR: (GLEEFUL) Oh Halus, if you think that sunset’s impressive, just you wait! I can promise you fireworks very soon that’1l take your breath away!\nDOCTOR: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL) Page 15\nDOCTOR: SCENE 11: INT. TOWER LOUNGE.

DUSK. (CONTINUOUS)\nBAV: KHORALLA’S SCREAMS. GLASS TINKLING ONTO PAVEMENT. SOME\nSTRUCTURAL: CREAKING.\nFLIP: What was that?\nHALUS: That Tower House!\nDOCTOR: Up at the top - the fifth floor. There’s someone in there! A woman, I think.\nHALUS: It’s a Nihilist attack! It must be!\nHALUS: STRAINING.\nDOCTOR: Energy discharges must have blown the generator!\nFLIP: We’ve got to rescue that woman!\nFLIP: RUNS TOWARDS TOWER.\nDOCTOR: Flip! You can’t just go charging in - that building’s not safe!\nHALUS: No Doctor. You stay with me!\nDOCTOR: (STRUGGLES) Get off me!\nHALUS: It’ll just be one family. Leave it to the response teams.\nDOCTOR: That’s hardly the point. (CALLS) Flip! (SHE DOESN’T STOP. HE GROANS) Oh she’s in there now! I’11l1 probably have to rescue her too. Halus, quickly - can we get to that top window with your aircar?\nDOCTOR: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL) Page 17\nHALUS: Don’t think so. It’d need a pulse-link and with all that sparking I’m not sure it’1ll be stable.\nDOCTOR: There must be some way.\nHALUS: We could try Lev plates.\nDOCTOR: Lev plates?\nHALUS: Floating work cradles - we use them at heights. If we commandeered three or four they could help shore the building\nHALUS: up.\nDOCTOR: Perfect. Where can we find some?\nHALUS: My workplace.\nDOCTOR: Is it far?\nHALUS: Not by aircar.\nHALUS: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL) Page 18\nHALUS: SCENE 13: INT. TOWER. STAIRWELL.

Where may I\nCORTEX: take you?\nDOCTOR: Your car key’s in your neck?\nHALUS: Just up. It’s an emergency- I need to fly manual.\nCORTEX: (CAR) Safety harness in place. Door closing. Manual control.\nCORTEX: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL) Page 20\nCORTEX: SCENE 15: INT. TOWER LOUNGE. DUSK.\nBAV: (TREATMENT) All musst burn! Free the Urge!\nKHORALLA: Please no, Bav...\nFLIP: (ASCENDING) Don’t worry, whatever the problem is, I can help. (CLOCKS BAV) What the heck!? Alright, maybe I exaggerated.\nKHORALLA: Get down!\nIGNITES: BEHIND THEM.\nFLIP: (WINDED) Aah!\nKHORALLA: Are you hurt?\nFLIP: Just winded. If you’d not knocked me behind this sofa I’d be in a far worse state.\nFLIP: (COUGHS) Not sure it’1ll last much longer. What is that thing?\nKHORALLA: It used to be my partner.\nFLIP: I can see why you split up.\nBAV: (TREATMENT) Musst make thiss ceasse!\nBAV: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL) Page 21\nKHORALLA: She wasn’t like this before, she was normal.\nFLIP: (COUGHS) What’s your name?\nKHORALLA: Khoralla.\nFLIP: Mine’s Flip. Is there anyone else here?\nKHORALLA: No, this tower’s just ours. We’d hoped maybe one day-\nFLIP: We need to get you out of here fast, Khoralla. The fumes off this aren’t good.\nKHORALLA: Can we get back to the stairs?\nFLIP: No. We’d be toasted.\nKHORALLA: If we can get to another window we could draw attention outside.\nFLIP: Good thinking. I’ve got a friend below. We’1ll need somewhere we can defend. Somewhere with a solid door that won’t burn quick.\nKHORALLA: There’s one place.\nFLIP: Can we get there?\nKHORALLA: We’d have to get past Bav. It’s the other side of the building.\nFLIP: We’1ll need to draw her fire. Grab any cushions you can safely reach.\nFLIP: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL) Page 22\nFLIP: SCENE 16: INT. AIRCAR FLYING. DUSK.\nDOCTOR: How far is it now? I don’t like to think of Flip in that building.\nHALUS: Not long.\nDOCTOR: Forgive me, Halus, I thought you’d switched off that autopilot thing to be more direct.\nHALUS: L. dad's\nDOCTOR: Only, judging by that 3D map display, we’re taking quite a curious route.\nHALUS: Just following the airways.\nDOCTOR: Yes, they’re more circuitous than I’d imagined - all ups, downs and odd curlicues. Can’t you just make your own way?\nHALUS: No, I can only punch short pulse-links with this unit. It’s not one of your elite cars with a big battery.\nDOCTOR: Let’s look at that map thing, see if I can’t work out a shortcut...\nDOCTOR: Now, if you show me where we’re headed I’m sure... (TRAILS OFF,\nDOCTOR: PERTURBED) Oh.\nHALUS: Doctor?\nHALUS: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL) Page 23\nDOCTOR: Just the strangest feeling... Déja vu. Occupational hazard when you've ‘vu’ed as much as I have, but something about the arrangement of these roads is familiar...\nDOCTOR: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL) Page 24\nDOCTOR: SCENE 17: INT. TOWER LOUNGE. DUSK.\nFLIP: Alright Khoralla. When I count three we throw these cushions\nFLIP: and run for that door, alright?\nKHORALLA: Wouldn’t it be easier just to give me a lode sign?\nFLIP: A what?\nKHORALLA: A lode sign.\nFLIP: What you feeling my neck for?\nKHORALLA: You don’t have a lode cell... You’re not from here, are you?\nFLIP: Let’s chat about that after, yeah? — Aim for the corner. One, two, three.\nFLIP: FLIP and KHORALLA:\nFLIP: (UNDER FLAME BURSTS) Run!\nBAV: (TREATMENT) Sstop!\nBAV: DOOR AND CLOSE IT JUST AS BAV SENDS A FIREBALL AFTER THEM.\nBAV: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL)\nBAV: SCENE 18: INT.

(CONTINUOUS).\nFLIP: It’s a bathroom!\nFLIP: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL) Page 26\nFLIP: SCENE 20: INT. AIRCAR FLYING. DUSK.\nDOCTOR: This isn’t the route to your work is it, Halus?\nHALUS: I wondered how soon you’d recognise the Enforcement block.\nDOCTOR: I don’t understand.\nHALUS: You can drop the pretence, Doctor. I saw the glee in your eyes when you talked about those “fireworks”! You’re in league with the Nihilists.\nDOCTOR: What? You think I meant that explosion? That wasn’t what I was talking about! That was just a coincidence. I was talking about something on a far greater scale.\nHALUS: Oh, got something bigger planned?\nDOCTOR: Now you’re just wilfully misunderstanding me! If we’d been behind that explosion, why would my friend Flip have run into the building? Hmm? It doesn’t make sense!\nHALUS: I don’t think Flip’s a Nihilist. I think you are - a sympathiser at the very least. Your class are all the same.\nDOCTOR: My class? My class? What class do you think I am?\nHALUS: You’re one of the elite aren’t you? So full of yourself you don’t even give off a proper lode trace.\nDOCTOR: Listen, my good man, I am not one of your elite! Where I come from I’m considered positively plebeian.\nHALUS: Well, I’d hate to live there.\nHALUS: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL) Page 27\nDOCTOR: Forgive me, much as I’d love to continue with this enthralling debate, there are more pressing matters at hand. I wonder, could I see that ‘car key’ of yours again?\nHALUS: What are you doing? Get off me!\nDOCTOR: Yes, an odd little node at the back of your neck. If I just apply a little pressure here...\nHALUS: No... (TRAILS OFF)\nDOCTOR: The old Chatterton nerve pinch, never fails. That’s right, Halus. You rest.\nDOCTOR: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL) Page 28\nDOCTOR: SCENE 21: INT. BATHROOM. DUSK.\nFLIP: What kind of place to hide is a bathroom?\nKHORALLA: I thought with the tiles it was less likely to catch fire. And there’s a lock... I’m sorry. I panicked.\nFLIP: No, don’t be, it makes sense, kind of. Let’s break this window. See if we can get some attention. (LOOKS AROUND) What can I smash it with?\nKHORALLA: You could use the shower head. The object there with the tubing.\nFLIP: Yeah, I’m from another planet but we still have showers there. Help hold me steady on the edge of the bath. (FLIP STANDS ON\nBATH: )\nKHORALLA: You’ve met people from other worlds before, haven’t you?\nFLIP: Stacks. This your first?\nKHORALLA: Yes. The first for any Festin, I suppose.\nFLIP: Can’t see my friend. Can’t see anyone much now the sun’s setting. I’d have expected a few hunky firemen at the very least.\nKHORALLA: The emergency response units are probably busy in the South- east. There’s been something big there.\nFLIP: Does this kind of thing happen a lot here? People turning into fire monsters?\nFLIP: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL) Page 29\nKHORALLA: No. I mean you hear party chatter, but I’d always assumed the Nihilists were disgruntled workers. I thought the stories of people burning were just myths. The worst thing is I didn’t think they could be people like me and Bav.\nFLIP: I’m coming down. Hold me steady. (KHORALLA HELPS) Thanks.\nFLIP: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL) Page 30\nFLIP: SCENE 22: INT. AIRCAR FLYING.

DUSK.\nBAV: (TREATMENT, THROUGH DOOR) The Urge musst be releassed!\nKHORALLA: The door’s smoking, Flip. Bav’ll be in soon.\nFLIP: Get in the bath!\nKHORALLA: What?\nFLIP: It’s shelter. It might insulate us from any electric stuff.\nKHORALLA: And what are you doing?\nFLIP: Clogging the sink.\nKHORALLA: Why?\nFLIP: I just thought if we can flood the room, we might cool that thing down. Water and fire- don’t get on, do they?\nKHORALLA: The door’s giving! Get in the bath with me!\nFLIP: Actually, water and electricity don’t get on either!\nKHORALLA: What are you doing with the shower?\nFLIP: Following a hunch!\nFLIP: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL) Page 32\nBAV: (TREATMENT) Musst end it all!\nFLIP: Here Sparky! See if this cools you down!\nFLIP: ELECTRICITY. THEN BOOM! BAV FALLS APART. SMASHING TILES, DEBRIS.\nKHORALLA: You did it, Flip! You saved us.\nFLIP: Yeah, I did, didn’t I? ..but I don’t think we’re safe yet. Don’t get out the bath, Khoralla!\nFLIP: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL) Page 33\nFLIP: SCENE 24: INT.

Don’t you dare try ramming me, you airborne Messala!\nDOCTOR: Ha, jumped roads! Didn’t expect that, did you? Nearly there. Hang on Flip.\nDOCTOR: AIRCAR.\nDOCTOR: What was that?

Where are we?\nHALUS: Where I was trying to take you- the Enforcement Block. (SHOUTING) Though now these idiots seem to think we’re in league!\nENFORCER: (THROUGH DOOR) Step away from cell door.\nDOCTOR: That robot has the same voice as your autopilot...\nHALUS: The Enforcer? Of course it has. They’re both Cortex run.\nDOCTOR: You out there, police robot! That collapsed tower - there’s a good chance my friend Flip was in there -\nHALUS: Don’t worry. It’s Elite housing, there’ll be response vehicles all over it.\nDOCTOR: You really do have a chip on your shoulder, don’t you, Halus? Or perhaps in your neck...\nDOCTOR: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL) Page 36\nDOCTOR: SCENE 28: INT. WARD. NIGHT.\nDOCTOR: AWAY. FLIP STIRS IN BED.\nFLIP: Aah.\nDAKEEM: Don’t move too quickly. You’re probably a little disorientated.\nFLIP: (GROGGY) Did I leave the taps on...?\nDAKEEM: We weren’t sure what level of pain relief to administer...\nFLIP: (SITS UP, DIZZY) Whoah! This level is quite good. Maybe a little bit too quite good. I’m.. Where’s Khoralla?\nKHORALLA: I’m here.\nFLIP: Good.\nKHORALLA: I was worried about you. You took a nasty blow to the head.\nFLIP: Did I?\nDAKEEM: When the tower collapsed.\nFLIP: It collapsed!?\nKHORALLA: Yes, the bath protected us. It made an air pocket.\nFLIP: Air pocket?\nKHORALLA: We had to be dug out by the response team.\nFLIP: So, is this a hospital?\nFLIP: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL) Page 37\nKHORALLA: It’s a treatment centre. They flew us straight here.\nDAKEEM: I wonder... Flip, can you confirm what Citizen Girson’s told me?\nFLIP: Citizen...?\nKHORALLA: He means me. Girson w.. (ABOUT TO USE PAST TENSE, CHOOSES NOT TO) is my married name. He wants you to say what happened at the tower.\nFLIP: Yeah, but who is he?\nDAKEEM: Special physician Dakeem. I’m working with your assessment team.\nFLIP: Where’s the Doctor?\nDAKEEM: She’1ll be attending other patients-\nFLIP: No, my Doctor!\nDAKEEM: Please Flip, further medical care can wait. First, I’1ll need your account of the incident. Everything, no matter how strange.\nDAKEEM: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL) Page 38\nDAKEEM: SCENE 29: INT. CELL. NIGHT.\nDAKEEM: BEHIND.\nENFORCER: Prisoner will submit to interrogation.\nDOCTOR: Please, call me Doctor. I only go by “Prisoner” in formal settings.\nENFORCER: Were you involved with the Nihilist Incident at Park View Tower?\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nHALUS: See?\nDOCTOR: I witnessed it, and attempted to get help. That’s the total extent of my involvement.\nHALUS: He’s lying! He knew it was coming. He said there’d be fireworks just before the explosion.\nDOCTOR: Pure coincidence. As you’ll soon see. I was actually referring to an incredible aurora that’1ll light up your skies tonight. A nearby star called Guitonus has just gone nova, and it’s about to give you quite a show. Of course, if you Festins had the basic curiosity to look up to the heavens, you’d know that already.\nHALUS: He’s a nihilist! He’s making this up!\nDOCTOR: If I were making something up, I’d be a great deal less specific.\nENFORCER: How do you know this?\nENFORCER: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL) Page 39\nDOCTOR: Surely you’ve examined me? You must have realised I’m not of your world?\nENFORCER: Your physiology is anomalous.\nDOCTOR: I’m flattered you noticed. Yes, two hearts, convoluted pulmonary system, piercing blue-green eyes.. no lump at the nape of my neck. I’m really not from ‘round here. Your “Nihilists” are really no concern of mine.\nENFORCER: Further analysis required.\nENFORCER: BEHIND.\nHALUS: What’s it doing? Why’s it gone?\nDOCTOR: It’s thinking... Or communicating with whatever does its thinking fOr. 1's\nHALUS: The Cortex?\nDOCTOR: If you say so. I take it the Cortex is a computer?\nHALUS: It’s the city admin net. It assigns employment, runs enforcement, plans airway paths, everything. — Are you really\nHALUS: not from Festin?\nDOCTOR: I am, as they say, just visiting.\nHALUS: And you’ve no lode cell?\nDOCTOR: Your neck bump? No. I assume it’s an implant that lets you and the Cortex interact?\nHALUS: Not exactly.\nHALUS: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL) Page 40\nDOCTOR: Because I’ve a nasty feeling it could be letting more messages in than you’re sending out... What do you mean, “not exactly”?\nHALUS: Lode cells aren’t implanted. They’re part of us. Always have been. We use them to connect to the Cortex now, but they’re part of every animal on Festin. It’s how we find our way around and get a sense of each other. They let us feel the world’s energies.\nHALUS: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL) Page 41\nHALUS: SCENE 30: INT. WARD. NIGHT.\nDAKEEM: So did you hear the Nihilist creature-\nKHORALLA: Bav.\nDAKEEM: Did you hear it speak at all, Flip?\nFLIP: A bit. It wasn’t chatty. It mainly sort of roared about destroying things. Then it destroyed things.\nDAKEEM: So it expressed no political, spiritual or philosophical viewpoints?\nFLIP: If it did I didn’t hear them. It wasn’t like it was going round saying “I think therefore I am” or anything. It mentioned an urge a few times, but that was it.\nDAKEEM: An “urge”?\nFLIP: Yeah. “Free the urge”. Stuff like that.\nDAKEEM: That’s useful.\nFLIP: Is it?\nKHORALLA: Physician Dakeem thinks transformations like Bav’s are caused by unhealthy thoughts.\nDAKEEM: It seems to be a physical manifestation of a psychological illness. This “urge” has come up before. It suggests a common origin. Some thought pattern or emotional state that makes excess energy vent from the lode cells and triggers cellular combustion. (BEAT) Naturally that’s classified.\nFLIP: Why?\nFLIP: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL) Page 42\nDAKEEM: People worrying they might turn into fire-beasts isn’t good for anyone.\nDAKEEM: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL) Page 43\nDAKEEM: SCENE 31 (A): INT. CELL. NIGHT.\nDOCTOR: You know Halus, something that Enforcement robot said was quite revealing. Your Cortex knows more than it’s telling you.\nHALUS: About the Nihilists?\nDOCTOR: No, I’m not even sure they exist. I’d not be surprised if they were an invention of the Cortex.\nHALUS: Why would it do that?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know. Social control? To create an enemy within and keep you divided? It’s been done before.\nDOCTOR: I’ve a feeling this Cortex sets the course of your lives in exactly the way it sets the routes of your aircars. You all feel you’re free to follow your own paths, but in reality you’re being nudged along predetermined tracks.\nHALUS: I don’t believe it.\nDOCTOR: Well, you wouldn’t, would you? I expect that’s why you’ve never gone into space. The Cortex can’t control the beings you’d meet there.\nHALUS: Oh, we’ve been into space, Doctor. My granddad worked on the rockets before the programme stopped.\nDOCTOR: Did he? So do you know why it stopped?\nHALUS: Probably got too expensive.\nDOCTOR: Pity.\nHALUS: Yes, the highest an engineer reaches these days is the ionosphere.\nHALUS: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL) Page 44\nDOCTOR: (AGREEMENT) Hmm. (BEAT) Why the ionosphere?\nHALUS: The airways. A lot of the new diversions loop up there. Useful at peak times.\nHALUS: That’s what most of my last jobs have been doing - making sure the force lines project up that far.\nDOCTOR: Oh no. We need to get out of here, Halus!\nHALUS: Why?\nDOCTOR: Because in just a few hours the upper levels of your atmosphere will be glowing from pole to pole with supercharged plasma. If you’ve got airways reaching up into it, that energy could end up coursing through your road network! Millions, maybe billions could die!\nHALUS: It'd be like the biggest Nihilist attack ever.\nDOCTOR: Yes, one set up by the Cortex!\nDOCTOR: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL) Page 45\nDOCTOR: PART TWO\nDOCTOR: [..] We need to get out of here, Halus!\nHALUS: Why?\nDOCTOR: Because in just a few hours the upper levels of your atmosphere will be glowing from pole to pole with supercharged plasma. If you’ve got airways reaching up into it, that energy could end up coursing through your road network!

[CONTINUOUS]\nHALUS: (DENIAL) But that’d be monstrous! The loss of life- the Cortex couldn’t permit it!\nDOCTOR: Not unless all your ‘little’ lives mattered less to it than some ‘grander’ design.\nDOCTOR: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL) Page 46\nDOCTOR: SCENE 32: INT. OFFICE. NIGHT.\nDAKEEM: SCROLLS THROUGH HIGH-SPEED TEXT.\nCORTEX: “The sage looked up the mountain and saw that while the villagers would die in the avalanche, the towns below could still be saved. She stood on the slope and screamed the snow down in the name of the Founders.”\nDAKEEM: Muse spool end.\nKHORALLA: May I come in, Dakeem?\nDAKEEM: Citizen Girson. Please.\nKHORALLA: Flip’s sleeping again.\nDAKEEM: Possibly the pain relief. Her biochemistry’s similar to ours but without lode cells for Cortex feedback it’s hard to judge the right dose. All those drugs racked up on shelves behind us, and only a handful we dare to use.\nKHORALLA: That’s Bav’s Muse, isn’t it?\nDAKEEM: Yes. It was recovered from the scene.\nKHORALLA: She was writing a libretto on it.\nDAKEEM: I’ve seen.\nKHORALLA: It’s based on a Foundation era text- ‘The Mortification of Saint Rasapon’.\nDAKEEM: I know it. Self-abnegation, isolation, despaiv...\nDAKEEM: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL) Page 47\nKHORALLA: And triumph.\nDAKEEM: Really?\nKHORALLA: Yes, at the end of Rasapon’s trials. No one knows it, but she saves the valley from the flood.\nDAKEEM: I suppose so.\nKHORALLA: So, are you expecting to find the trigger to Nihilism in there? It’s not like it’s Festin’s most obscure legend.\nDAKEEM: No. Maybe a trigger, a contributory factor. Nihilism could be related to disturbed emotions and there is a certain melancholy an this.\nKHORALLA: Yes, but that in lots of our culture, isn’t it? Tonight... before all this, we were going to the opera- ‘The Martyrdom of Baran-Selan’, another tragic one. Even our children’s stories have it- look at ‘The Broken Toy Cart’! You don’t hear about nurseries full of children turning Nihilist!\nDAKEEM: No.\nDAKEEM: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL) Page 48\nDAKEEM: SCENE 33: INT. CELL.

There you are!\nENFORCER: You are free to go.\nDOCTOR: Thank you, I’m grateful you’ve seen sense but our first priority is to prevent [a disaster]\nENFORCER: No. You are to remain here. Worker Halus — You are free to go.\nHALUS: Me?\nDOCTOR: What possible justification can you have for detaining me?\nENFORCER: You are alien. Your motivations are unknown. You may be a danger to Festin society.\nDOCTOR: No! You’re the danger to Festin society, enforcer, or rather this Cortex you serve is. Your airway layout’s like a crazy lightning rod! It could set this whole world alight and, more to the point, you know it.\nDOCTOR: You asked me how I knew about Guitonus exploding. You didn’t ask why I thought it might. I think that’s rather telling, don’t you?\nENFORCER: You will be questioned further. Worker Halus, You will leave.\nDOCTOR: Halus, you’re an engineer, see if you can put an end to this!\nENFORCER: You will leave.\nHALUS: (LEAVES WITH ENFORCER) What can I do, Doctor? I’m just one man.\nHALUS: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL) Page 49\nDOCTOR: Find Flip, she’ll help you! You may be just one man, Halus, but with Flip by your side you can do anything!\nDOCTOR: Just so long as she’s still alive.\nDOCTOR: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL) Page 50\nDOCTOR: SCENE 34: INT. WARD. NIGHT.\nFLIP: (FROM BED) Khoralla? Is that you?\nKHORALLA: Flip! You’re awake. How are you feeling now?\nFLIP: A little sore. I think the anaesthetic must be wearing off.\nKHORALLA: We could get you more. There’s shelves of drugs racked up in that office.\nFLIP: No, I think I’ve had enough. I had the maddest dreams.\nKHORALLA: Stranger than real life?\nFLIP: (SITTING UP) Yeah, my mum and Jared ballroom dancing. And Jared hates dancing. He’s not watched Strictly since Holly Valance went.\nKHORALLA: Right.\nFLIP: (STANDS) Come on, we need to find the Doctor.\nKHORALLA: I can call for assistance.\nFLIP: No, my friend the Doctor.\nHALUS: Hello? I’m looking for Flip. I was told she was on this ward.\nFLIP: Halus! We were just- Is the Doctor with you?\nHALUS: I’m afraid not.\nHALUS: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL) Page 51\nHALUS: SCENE 35: INT. OFFICE. NIGHT.\nDAKEEM: (PONDERING) I wonder...

Maybe that’s the urge. All we are is a vehicle for an idea!\nDAKEEM: (HE LAUGHS AGAIN, THEN GASPS. PAIN. FEAR) No! No!\nDAKEEM: STARTING TO FIZZ.\nDAKEEM: It’s in me! I’m starting to burn...!\nDAKEEM: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL) Page 52\nDAKEEM: SCENE 36: INT. CELL.

My people are more powerful than you may imagine and when they realise-\nENFORCER: In.\nFLIP: (ENTERS) Alright, I’m going.\nDOCTOR: Flip! You’re safe!\nFLIP: ‘Course I am. I’m always safe, aren’t I?\nDOCTOR: So Halus found you.\nFLIP: Yeah, he said you were locked up and we had to get you free quick, so I thought I’d come and bust you out.\nDOCTOR: Yes.. you do realise ‘busting me out’ would probably work better as a plan if we weren’t now locked up together?\nFLIP: No, that’s the clever bit. Come over here.\nFLIP: There’s odd stuff going on here, Doctor, wrong stuff.\nDOCTOR: I know.\nFLIP: There’s people called Nihilists disrupting things...\nFLIP: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL) Page 53\nDOCTOR: (SMUG) I know. But they don’t exist, do they?\nFLIP: No they do, I’ve met one. They burst into flames and zap electric everywhere. That’s what blew that big house up.\nDOCTOR: No, no, I’m convinced they’re invented by the Festin computer system to keep people in check. They’re a convenient fiction.\nFLIP: Well, I’m sorry, I’ve seen one.\nDOCTOR: What?\nFLIP: (CROUCHING IN CORNER) Yeah, they seem to be something to do with people getting miserable.\nDOCTOR: Flip? Why are you curling up like that?\nFLIP: Because it can’t be long now. You should too.\nDOCTOR: What can’t be long now?\nDOCTOR: SPARKS. AN ALARM. WE HEAR WIND AND AIRCARS OUTSIDE.\nFLIP: That!\nDOCTOR: It’s an aircar!\nFLIP: Yeah. Clever plan, eh? Halus gave me a few minutes to get locked up and get you away from that wall, then he aimed his car at it!\nDOCTOR: Oh no, that wreck- is Halus in there?\nHALUS: (OUTSIDE, BELOW) Come on, Doctor! We’re just out here!\nDOCTOR: (RELIEVED, RUSHES TO HOLE) Halus! How did you do that?\nDOCTOR: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL) Page 54\nHALUS: (OUTSIDE, BELOW) Set aircar to manual, fired pulses at the wall and got out quick.\nHALUS: Now get down here before the pursuit cars launch!\nHALUS: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL) Page 55\nHALUS: SCENE 37: EXT. ENFORCEMENT BLOCK. NIGHT.\nSCRAMBLING: OUT THE CELL.\nENFORCER: (LOUDSPEAKER) Containment cell 9 breached, deploy available units.\nDOCTOR: Come on Flip, take my hand. Don’t look down! The aircar’s just here.\nHALUS: (BELOW) Jump in before the link decays!\nDOCTOR: Ready?\nFLIP: Here goes!\nDOCTOR AND FLIP: (JUMPING) Aaaah...!\nDOCTOR AND FLIP: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL) Page 56\nDOCTOR AND FLIP: SCENE 38: INT. LARGE AIRCAR FLYING. NIGHT (CONTINUOUS).\nCORTEX: (CAR) DOORS CLOSING.\nHALUS: Go!\nKHORALLA: Already doing it. Brace yourselves back there!\nDOCTOR: (STRAIGHTENING UP) The lady from the tower! You got out!\nKHORALLA: My name’s Khoralla, Flip rescued me.\nFLIP: Making a habit of it, aren’t I?\nDOCTOR: You are rather, but please do try to think now and again before leaping in.\nKHORALLA: My partner had turned Nihilist.\nFLIP: She changed into a fire monster, Doctor. How’s that even work?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know.\nKHORALLA: There’s a physician called Dakeem working on it at the local treatment centre. It seems to be brought on by an unstable mental state.\nHALUS: They say it’s when you’re weakened emotionally.\nKHORALLA: Who does?\nHALUS: (DEFENSIVE) People. You hear rumours... people on edge.\nHALUS: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL) Page 57\nDOCTOR: I think this whole society may have been deliberately kept on edge for some time. It’s possible these Nihilists are the unfortunate few who can’t cope.\nDOCTOR: But why? And what’s the Cortex playing at with the airways? Do you mind if I look at this road map?\nKHORALLA: Be my guest.\nDOCTOR: It’s like a page from a book...\nFLIP: How? Its 3D, bits move around.\nDOCTOR: A Time Lord book, Flip. Their pages reach into dimensions your books can’t. Makes it very easy to lose your place.\nDOCTOR: (BEAT) Oh no... It’s like something from an Old Time book, from before the Cosmos was made stable.\nFLIP: What?\nDOCTOR: I think this map’s a sigil.\nKHORALLA: And what does that actually mean?\nDOCTOR: It means we’re in the middle of something more terrible than you can possibly imagine.\nDOCTOR: We need to get access to the Cortex and close down those links to the ionosphere.\nHALUS: Could the computers at the treatment centre do that?\nDOCTOR: With some encouragement from me? I hope so.\nDOCTOR: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL)\nDOCTOR: SCENE 39: INT. OFFICE. DAY.\nHANDS: FLARING AND SPARKING.\nDAKEEM: Must be something in here to stop it.\nDAKEEM: THEM. SPARKS BUILD.\nDAKEEM: No, not a stimulant! Need something else...\nDAKEEM: Page 58\nDAKEEM: RACKED WITH DRUGS.\nAND DISCARDING: (TREATMENT) No! Need to keep thiss controlled!\nAND DISCARDING: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL) Page 59\nAND DISCARDING: SCENE 40: INT. WARD. NIGHT.\nKHORALLA: The ward computer’s down here!\nDOCTOR: Halus- with me. Let’s see what we can do.\nHALUS: if you think I can help...\nDOCTOR: (FRUSTRATED) Uh! These terminals are useless! They link to the patients minds, here, but there’s no way I can use them to influence the Cortex.\nFLIP: Are you sure?\nDOCTOR: Yes!\nDAKEEM: (OFF, BEHIND SIDE DOOR) Aaaargh!\nDOCTOR: What was that?\nKHORALLA: It sounded like Dakeem.\nHALUS: Dakeem?\nKHORALLA: The physician working on Nihilism.\nDOCTOR: It came from somewhere over here I think. (GOING WRONG WAY)\nKHORALLA: No, this way. The office he was in before. I felt it in my lode cells.\nDOCTOR: Shall we see?\nDOCTOR: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL) Page 60\nDOCTOR: SCENE 41. INT. OFFICE. NIGHT. (CONTINUOUS).\nACROSS: FLOOR.\nDOCTOR: It’s a bit of a state. Pill containers everywhere...\nKHORALLA: It wasn’t like this before. (CALLS) Dakeem? Maybe he’s over in the shelving racks? (CALLS) Dakeem?\nKHORALLA: REAR.\nDAKEEM: (TREATMENT) Yess.\nFLIP: Oh no. It’s happening again. He’s turned Nihilist.\nHALUS: Run! Now!\nDAKEEM: (TREATMENT) No.. I have the urge... in check.\nDOCTOR: You’re controlling it. How?\nDAKEEM: (TREATMENT) Medication here. Dampenss the feelingss.\nFLIP: Not completely.\nOFFICE: The urge iss hard to keep down. The dart gun by your left, Citizen Girsson. If I become dangerouss.. that sshould control\nOFFICE: me.\nKHORALLA: (SCOOPS UP DART GUN) Got it.\nDOCTOR: What is this urge, Dakeem?\nDOCTOR: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL) Page 61\nDAKEEM: (TREATMENT) Ssomething insside uss. Ssomething dormant.\nDOCTOR: But what triggers it? Is it the Cortex?\nDAKEEM: (TREATMENT) No... The Cortex iss jusst a tool.\nHALUS: It’s depression, isn’t it?\nDAKEEM: (TREATMENT) No. It’ss elation, a realissation of inssignificance- the joyouss disscovery you’re jusst a vessssel for the urge.\nDAKEEM: (TREATMENT) Keep back, jusst thinking about it, makess me want to desstroy.\nDOCTOR: So, if it’s not the Cortex, what is it?\nDAKEEM: (TREATMENT) It’ss part of who we are, it’ss always been in uss. We need to desstroy the basse to sserve the ideal, even when the basse is oursselvess... (GASPS, LOSING CONTROL)\nDOCTOR: What about the roads, that sigil form?\nHALUS: Flip, get back.\nDAKEEM: (TREATMENT, FIGHTING SELF) Can’t control it! Do it, Citizen Girsson! The dart gun!\nKHORALLA: If you’re sure...\nKHORALLA: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL) Page 62\nDAKEEM: (TREATMENT, RELEASE) Aah!\nFLIP: The flames are going out!\nDOCTOR: Oh, no, no, no! I think I know, why. (RUSHES OVER TO EXAMINE DAKEEM, DISTRESS) I thought so! He put a lethally high dose in the ampoule darts!\nFLIP: Why would he do that?\nDOCTOR: Because he was a very brave and selfless man, Flip, fighting something awful inside him.\nKHORALLA: Self-sacrifice runs deep in our culture. He did it to keep us safe.\nDOCTOR: (LEAVING) Come on, I need to get back to those computers.\nDOCTOR: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL) Page 63\nDOCTOR: SCENE 42: INT. WARD. NIGHT. (CONTINUOUS).\nDOCTOR: (HEADING BACK TO COMPUTERS) I thought the Cortex was manipulating Festin behaviour but that’s not it. I think it’s obeying orders you don’t know you’ve given it. Deep down, I think you want to be dead!\nKHORALLA: That’s ridiculous!\nHALUS: Is it?\nDOCTOR: Your lode cells are attuned to the planet’s magnetic fields. They generate and receive electrical information. They help you orientate yourself and allow limited empathic communication.\nKHORALLA: Obviously.\nDOCTOR: Not to aliens like me and Flip. These cells allow you to act as one entity without even realising. You’ve probably always been a loose neural network, but since you linked through the Cortex, that network’s become stronger. You’ve created a controlling collective unconscious- this ‘urge’.\nKHORALLA: And it wants to die?\nDOCTOR: It seems so. I think you’ve unwittingly made something that once helped your species survive into something that threatens every one of you.\nFLIP: Fine, whatever. How can we do to stop it?\nDOCTOR: Maybe, by understanding it. This hospital must have six or seven hundred patients all connected to monitoring equipment by their lode cells. If I can make a few adjustments to the monitoring set up, I may be able to talk to a simplified version of your collective unconscious.\nHALUS: A simplified version? There are billions of us!\nHALUS: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL) Page 64\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nKHORALLA: So what use will that be?\nDOCTOR: If I can make a collective isolated here realise what it’s doing, maybe I can use it to challenge the collective behind the Cortex.\nHALUS: And switch off the airways?\nDOCTOR: Hopefully, yes.\nFLIP: Seven hundred people though. Is that enough?\nDOCTOR: Think of it as an opinion poll, Flip. It’s a small sample but it’ll give us an idea of the bigger picture.\nFLIP: We always lie to polls. Mum says it serves them right.\nDOCTOR: Let’s just hope the Festin unconscious isn’t like your mum. (STOPS TYPING) There. Let’s see if this works.\nDOCTOR: TONE AND RHYTHM OF BREATHING AND MONITORING IN WARD CHANGES.\nDOCTOR: (GRANDSTANDING) This is the Doctor addressing the ‘urge’ of the Festin mind.\nKHORALLA: Nothing’s happening.\nDOCTOR: Don’t make me force you to speak, ‘urge’. I assure you- I can.\nCORTEX: (COMPUTER) Thiss iss the Urge. You can be heard.\nHALUS: It’s the voice of the Cortex!\nHALUS: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL) Page 65\nDOCTOR: No, just the voice of this equipment. Listen to me, Urge, there’s something I don’t believe you understand. Somehow you’ve come to be a threat to all Festin life.\nCORTEX: (COMPUTER) No. You have failed to undersstand. Fesstin iss an irrelevance. It hass only one purpose, sself-desstruction to sset the Urge free.\nDOCTOR: That doesn’t make sense.\nCORTEX: (COMPUTER) We are beyond your comprehenssion.\nDOCTOR: Try me, you might be surprised.\nCORTEX: (COMPUTER) We are not of your realm, it iss beneath uss.\nDOCTOR: You’re from another dimension?\nCORTEX: (COMPUTER) In your parlance. Yess.\nDOCTOR: Then what are you doing here?\nCORTEX: (COMPUTER) An error occurred. We became anchored in thiss Sspace- wrapped in matter and sserial time, woven into every creature living here. Unimaginable torment.\nDOCTOR: Explain.\nCORTEX: (COMPUTER) We can not, thiss ssliver of oursselvess iss inssufficient.\nDOCTOR: All right. But, what are you doing here- the roads, the Nihilists...?\nCORTEX: (COMPUTER) We wissh to re-enter the true reality. We have engineered thiss world’ss desstruction to allow that. The Fesstinss have made roadss that can channel our will, ssent rocketss to a sstar they have caussed it to die.\nCORTEX: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL) Page 66\nDOCTOR: The space programme... All it was ever for was to take warheads to Guitonus!\nHALUS: But the last rockets were a hundred years ago!\nDOCTOR: And it takes conventional rockets about a hundred years to travel two light days.\nCORTEX: (COMPUTER) Energy from that sstar death will ssoon sspill through the airwayss- the Fesstinss will ssee their inssignificance joyoussly as it ripss them apart and releassess their inner energiess.\nDOCTOR: An enormous Nihilist circuit channelled through lode cells. (HORROR) You’re engineering a planet-wide thought fuelled by death.\nCORTEX: (COMPUTER) Thiss world will become a glyph of our will, a ssigil opening up a doorway to our freedom...\nDOCTOR: The airways. That’s it! They’re arranged like a sigil from one of the first forbidden texts.\nFLIP: What is a sigil?\nDOCTOR: A sort of magical symbol, from a book I wish I’d never seen.\nFLIP: Then we’re alright, aren’t we? Magic’s not real.\nDOCTOR: Whether it works or not, this vile ‘Urge’ still intends to kill billions. It’s an abomination.\nKHORALLA: Then tell it won’t work!\nDOCTOR: It won’t listen. It believes in magic, or the little piece we have here does.\nDOCTOR: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL) Page 67\nCORTEX: (COMPUTER) Our belief iss all that iss required- our belief given the power of a billion perfectly aligned deathss. It will rip open thiss sshroud sspace and return us to the light.\nHALUS: No, you can’t do this. We’1ll stop you!\nCORTEX: (COMPUTER) How? It hass been in motion ssince the firsst livess sstirred here.\nDOCTOR: So, the previous Nihilist outbreaks?\nCORTEX: (COMPUTER) Jusst the unssound who were triggered too ssoon.\nKHORALLA: My Bav was not unsound!\nDOCTOR: So this whole civilisation exists solely so you can obliterate Lt?\nCORTEX: (COMPUTER) Yess.\nDOCTOR: (REVULSION) Then you’re not from a dimension higher than ours. Your dimension is unthinkably beneath us. Know this- Urge, I will defeat you.\nDOCTOR: BREATHING AND MONITORING RESTORES.\nDOCTOR: I just don’t know how.\nDOCTOR: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL) Page 68\nDOCTOR: SCENE 43: INT. WARD. NIGHT.\nFLIP: Doctor. It can’t be long now...\nDOCTOR: I know! I know!\nKHORALLA: Halus- you understand the roads. Can’t we bring the circuit down somehow?\nHALUS: I doubt it. Not before the energy from Guitonus hits.\nDOCTOR: We’d have to destroy the whole Cortex.\nFLIP: Well, can’t we do that?\nDOCTOR: Not quickly. It’s a planet-sized neural network.\nFLIP: Can’t we block the rays then, stop them getting here?\nDOCTOR: What with? It’s a star. You can’t just blot it out with an umbrella!\nFLIP: Can’t the TARDIS do something?\nDOCTOR: No! Well, perhaps in theory... but it’s insanely dangerous, Flip. You’d have to generate enormous, space-warping mass to even nudge the energy off course. The only way to do it would be to invert the ship’s dimensions and extrude its interior into normal space.\nFLIP: So do that!\nDOCTOR: Even if it could be done it’d almost certainly destroy the TARDIS. It might well be as dangerous to space-time as what the Urge has planned.\nFLIP: Alright, what about the drugs Dakeem used then? If we can get those to people it might suppress the Urge a bit.\nFLIP: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL) Page 69\nDOCTOR: We don’t have the time! We need to think of something we can do with the resources we have.\nFLIP: Could we mess up the traffic? The Urge is relying on the Cortex to arrange the roads like its sigil thing, yeah? But if we sent some cars out to get in the way...\nDOCTOR: I suppose that might redirect some of the energy but what could one or two vehicles do?\nHALUS: They could do something! And if they were firing out link pulses, they might weaken up the circuit shape...\nFLIP: Hang on, Khoralla- you said we were flown here from the accident, yeah?\nKHORALLA: Yes.\nFLIP: So there’s air ambulances?\nKHORALLA: Bays of them.\nFLIP: How many?\nKHORALLA: I don’t know, fifty or sixty?\nFLIP: So if we set fifty or sixty ambulances going without drivers like Halus did with his car...?\nDOCTOR: You know, Flip, that’s brilliant! It wouldn’t be much, but with pulse-links breaking up the road patterns and the police trying to bring them in, it might just disrupt the sigil.\nFLIP: Really?\nDOCTOR: It’s worth a try! Even if it only dissipates a tiny bit of energy it may save some lives.\nDOCTOR: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL) Page 70\nFLIP: Right then! Show us these ambulance bays, Khoralla!\nFLIP: Doctor?\nDOCTOR: I’ll be with you in a moment, I’m going to have one last try reasoning with this ‘Urge’.\nHALUS: (CALLING BACK) Flip?\nFLIP: Alright! I’1l1 see you soon! (RUNS OFF)\nDOCTOR: (A BEAT, SIGHS) Right. To the TARDIS then.\nDOCTOR: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL) Page 71\nDOCTOR: SCENE 44: INT. AMBULANCE BAY. NIGHT.\nDOCTOR: FLIP, KHORALLA AND HALUS RUN IN.\nFLIP: Down here?\nKHORALLA: Yes.\nPILOT: What are you doing? This area’s emergency pilots only!\nHALUS: Are you an emergency pilot?\nPILOT: Yes!\nHALUS: Good.\nKHORALLA: Halus! What are you doing? He’s out cold!\nHALUS: We don’t have time to talk and we need a lode key tuned to these vehicles. Help me carry him to the nearest one.\nHALUS: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL) Page 72\nHALUS: SCENE 45: EXT. PARK. NIGHT.\nITS: EXTERIOR HUM, FOREGROUND. OCEANIC SWIRLING FIZZY HISS BUILDS IN UPPER SKY.\nDOCTOR: (HALTS, PATS TARDIS) There you are, parked in the park! (RATTLES FOR KEY) How are we for time? (LOOKS TO SKIES, EXASPERATION) No, it’s already starting!\nDOCTOR: DEMATERIALISES.\nDOCTOR: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL) Page 73\nDOCTOR: SCENE 46: INT. AMBULANCE BAY.\nHALUS: (IN AMBULANCE) Right, I’m launching the ambulance... now! (HE\nBAILS: OUT)\nBAILS: ZAPPING!\nFLIP: Nice work!\nKHORALLA: It’s heading straight for a junction point!\nFLIP: Come on, let’s get our pilot to the next one!\nHALUS: Oh no, the sky...\nKHORALLA: It’s beginning to pinken, isn’t it?\nHALUS: Not just that! Guitonus there- it’s glowing white!\nHALUS: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL) Page 74\nHALUS: SCENE 47: INT. TARDIS. DAY.\nDOCTOR: (TYPES) Right, architectural configuration re-routed to real world interface.\nDOCTOR: This is going to hurt a lot, old friend, but I’m afraid it’s kill or cure. It might well be both. (FLICKS SWITCH)\nSHIFTING: ECHO TRAILS.\nDOCTOR: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL) Page 75\nDOCTOR: SCENE 48: INT. AMBULANCE BAY. NIGHT.\nDOCTOR: PULSE-LINKS. SWERVING. BIG SWIRLY SKY HISS BEHIND.\nHALUS: (AWE) Look at it! Those swirls of light in the upper sky...\nKHORALLA: Don’t!\nHALUS: Even if it ends up destroying us, it is stunning.\nFLIP: Halus! We need to launch this next ambulance!\nHALUS: Maybe I could pilot it? I could cause more disruption at the controls- really get into the thick of things.\nKHORALLA: No, you’re more use launching a series of these than you are doing something impressive with one. We’ve seen enough self- sacrifice.\nFLIP: Will one of you give me a hand!\nFLIP: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL) Page 76\nFLIP: SCENE 49: INT. TARDIS. DAY.\nFLIP: TRAILS. DOCTOR TYPING WILDLY.\nDOCTOR: (AGONY) Keep going! I know it hurts but please, keep going! It doesn’t matter if it kills us- we’ve got to do this!\nDOCTOR: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL) Page 77\nDOCTOR: SCENE 50: EXT. SKY. NIGHT. [NO DIALOGUE]\nDOCTOR: PRANGS AND SCRAPES, CARS LOOPING OFF IN ALL DIRECTIONS.\nENFORCEMENT: SIRENS APPROACHING. GRAPPLE LINES FIRING. SKY FIZZ FADING.\nCROSS TO: SCENE 51: INT. AMBULANCE BAY. NIGHT. [CONTINUOUS]\nFLIP: Help me lift this pilot!\nHALUS: Flip... Look up.\nFLIP: No! I don’t want to hear how lovely it is, I don’t want any despair, or anything! We’re here to save as many people as we can. Now come on!\nKHORALLA: No, Flip, look. It’s Guitonus. It’s vanished.\nFLIP: What? It can’t have exploded completely! Can it?\nKHORALLA: It’s not there. It’s like it’s been blotted out the sky.\nHALUS: And the aurora light’s fading too. The energy’s not going to arc down!\nFLIP: (REMEMBERS) ‘Blotted’...?\nFLIP: He’s done it, hasn’t he? The thing he said was too dangerous. It’s the Doctor. It must be. He’s tricked us!\nKHORALLA: How?\nFLIP: He sent us out of the way so he could go off and be all heroic, on his own! Using the TARDIS to deflect energy from Guitonus.\nFLIP: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL) Page 78\nHALUS: So how long will he have to do that for?\nFLIP: I don’t know. How long does a supernova give off dangerous rays?\nKHORALLA: It might be a long time.\nDOCTOR: (TIRED) Well, to be truthful, that’s a slightly grey area.\nFLIP: Doctor!\nDOCTOR: Flip!\nFLIP: Hang on, if you’re not up there in the TARDTS...\nDOCTOR: Don’t worry, I am. Or I have been, anyway.\nFLIP: You're in two places at once! Isn’t that cheating?\nDOCTOR: Nonsense, I’m in one place at once. The there I’m in out in Space is a good few billion miles off. It’s also easily a day ago.\nFLIP: You look tired. Are you... older?\nDOCTOR: Every second. Aren’t you? Let’s get back to that ward.\nDOCTOR: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL) Page 79\nDOCTOR: SCENE 52: INT. WARD. DAWN.\nHALUS: Through here.\nDOCTOR: Of course! Yes! This brings back memories!\nKHORALLA: We were only here a few minutes ago...\nFLIP: How long have you been away, Doctor?\nDOCTOR: Not easy to say. It took an awful lot of mass to bend the energy of Guitonus away from Festin, and that amount of mass does strange things to Space and Time. It’s played havoc with the TARDIS’ interior dimensions. Took an age stuffing everything back in.\nFLIP: How long?\nDOCTOR: It’s been a long couple of days.\nDOCTOR: INSTRUMENTS AND BREATHING ALTER.\nDOCTOR: Hello Urge.\nCORTEX: (COMPUTER) Doctor.\nDOCTOR: You remembered! I’m touched. That must mean we’re both still alive and reality’s intact. Well, I’m pleased, even if you’re not. Just wanted a word before plugging you back into the main Cortex. I wanted to tell you you’d lost. Your kind always does.\nCORTEX: (COMPUTER) The Urge will triumph, Doctor. We sshall regain perfection.\nDOCTOR: I shan’t hold my breath waiting. You’ve been defeated once. You will be again.\nDOCTOR: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL) Page 80\nCORTEX: (COMPUTER) You cannot desstroy uss.\nDOCTOR: No, but then I wouldn’t want to. Destruction’s what you crave, and for that- you deserve to live. Enjoy your punishment. Let the rest of you know it failed.\nHALUS: You let it live!?\nDOCTOR: I had to. To destroy it you’d have to burn this whole world.\nKHORALLA: So, it’s still there? In the Cortex... and all of us?\nDOCTOR: Yes. It’s locked into your biology, and it’1ll try to escape again.\nKHORALLA: So, what can we do?\nDOCTOR: You’1l have to be vigilant, question your instincts, question the Cortex. Trust each other. Together you can make this world serve you.\nDOCTOR: Shall we go, Flip?\nFLIP: Where?\nDOCTOR: Anywhere you like.\nFLIP: You’re on!\nFLIP: #225b: CORTEX FIRE by Ian Potter (FINAL) Page 8&1\nFLIP: SCENE 53: EXT. PARK. DAWN.\nSTROLL: HOME.\nDOCTOR: I’m sorry we missed the opera, Flip.\nFLIP: Hey, I got to play 3D Dodgems instead. I think I still win.\nDOCTOR: I’1ll organise something else- a banquet for all the senses. Fine food... helicopters... chandeliers!\nFLIP: Can’t we just have something a bit smaller... more human?\nDOCTOR: What do you suggest?\nFLIP: Punch and Judy and a bag of chips?\nDOCTOR: Perfect! (STOPS AT TARDIS) Here we are. (UNLOCKS DOOR) Coming?\nFLIP: Doctor, you know how similar to Festins we look?\nDOCTOR: Yes.\nFLIP: Well, could the Urge be in us too?\nDOCTOR: I don’t know. The Urge we spoke to seemed to think it was a local phenomenon.\nFLIP: Yes, but that was just a little bit of it. It didn’t know its full self.\nDOCTOR: But who does? — Come on, Flip.\nDOCTOR: BEGINS."
